Some additional information that we would need to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar should be placed in each identical container, how or what tool to use to measure the mass of the four different samples and how much distilled water to use to rinse the four samples after taking them out of the vinegar.
After reading the expirement, I realized that the additional information you need to replicate the expireiment is one, the amant of vinegar you poured in each container, two, label the containers before you start yar expirement and three, write a conclusion to make sure yar results are accurate.
What you need is more trials, a control set up, and an exact amount of vinegar to pour in each cup/beaker. You could also take and check the mass every 30 min or 1 hour.
The student should list what rock is better and what rock is the worse in the procedure.
For the students to be able to make a replicate, they would need to tell use how much vinegar is used and what tipe of materials is needed for the expirement.
I would need the information of why you would let the different samples dry out of the containers. And what are they drying into?
The information I would need in order to sucessfully replicate the experiment is the correct measurement they used for the experiment, also the materials that was used to creat the experiament. After the 24 hours, of removing the samples from the container and rinsen each sample with distilled water. Making it dry for 30 mintued might not be long enough to really determine the mass of each sample, especially when you have more than one different samples to do with different texture.
You would need many more pieces of information to replicate the experiment. You would need the type of samples to begin with in the procedure. You would also need to know the amount of vinegar used in each container. You would also need to know exactly how to mass the samples and what types of container to use (plastic for example, might alter the results).
Some additional information you will need are the material. You also need to know the size of the contaneir to measure how the acid rain effected it. You need to know how much vineager is used for each sample. Another thing that would help is to know how big the sample stones are by measureing  the best possible way.
Inorder to replicate the experiment, we will need to add information such as sticlenx statement of what the four samples are and how many pieces you will need, as well as the amount of vinegar bring poured into the containers and the instruments you will need to retrieve when determining mass.However, revisions of sentences and renuminering will be required.
An additional information that i would need in order to replicate the experiment
The additional infomation you would need to replicate the experiment would include the size of the samples. Also you would need to know the kind of vinegar. In a ddition it is crucial to get the same type and size containers.
There are two pieces of additional information neccisary to replicate the experiment. Fipst of all the procedure does not officialy specify what the four samples are. Also,the procedure does not specify how much vinigar to pour for each container. A good procedure would have specified this
In order the replicate the experiment you need
Well what i understand about this procedure is that you take four samples, put them in different containers that look the same, put vinegar on every sample + finally rinse them out with normal water + let them sit for 30 minutes till they dry. Then your finally going to see the difference between those samples.
I don't know what is going on!
In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know the shape of each material, because the amount of surface area expand to the vinegar mass, changes the results. I would also need to know how much vinegar and what size containers to use in order to exactly replicate the experiment.
The additional information I would need is to come up with an hypothesis to predict which sample will have the highest mass in acid rain. After that I will have to come up with my dependent and independent variables so I can tell and see each one is different in mass. I will organize the data to see if the information is accurate. Then I will write the conclusion to see if my hypothesis was correct and to see if my results were correct.
In order to replicate this experiment I would need a scare in order to get the mass. Next, I would need tape and markers to label the containers. Last, I would need all 4 samples and graduated cylinders as a container to replicate this experiment.
In order for the me to replicate their procedure, I would need to know what four samples they used, they should include that in their procedure. Also they should stay  where you are to put the four containers during the 24 hour time period finally, they should include what type of vinegar or what brand so that when i were to do this experiment, I would in as close to what they actually did, and therefore would be able to replicate the experiment.
You would need to have four seperate but identical containers. you would also need to pour in each of them Vinegar to determine the mass of the items being placed in them. And new items would be needed to be placed in each of the containers.
Inorder to replicate the experiment, I would need to know the mass of the four different samples, how much vinegar to pour into the containers, what the samples were made up of, and how much water to rinse them with after the 24 hours.
The students data needed to include how much of the solution was poored. They also needed to find out if the rocks weighed the same when they started.
For this experiments duplication, you would need to know exactly how much vinegar was used in each cup. You would also have to know how big in size each container was. Additionally, you would need to know the size of each sample, to assure that you could place them in the cups evenly.
Some additional information that I would need is the amount of vinegar they poured.
After reading the groups procedure I would need to know what type of vinegar they were using because it could of been any type, what was the measure of containers because the containers could have been 3 different sizes and they wouldn't have valid results, and they also should have told me what they were holding constant because I wouldn't know what variables to use or control.
They needed to include what time they started and when they ended. Also the amount of vinegar they used. Also the size of each sample.

In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know what the samples were. In this group's procedure, they do not state what
In step three, you would need to know how much of each sample to use. Also in step to you need to fill each container with the same amount step 4 you must rinse each stone as much. Also there is no control variable.
I additional information that I would need to replicate the experiment is to add where your going to leave the samples for 24 hours. Another one that they would need to add in order for me to replicate the experiment is to clearly state the independent variable. I would also need them to state how much vinegar to pour into each seperate but identical, container.
You will need a timer to determine the time that the vinegar dryed up.
For this experiment, you would actually need to know what each ''sample'' is, the amount of vinegar that was used and the size of each ''sample''
To replicate the experiment I would need to know the samples that I will be using. I would also need to know how much vinegar to use. I would also need to know what type of containers to use.
In order to replicate the experiment.You would need to know how much vinegar to pour ,you need to know how much distilled water and you aso need to know how your going to weigh it.
Well I would need to know what the problem statement is. I would need to know what type of cups we are using.I would need to know the amount of vinegar we are using. And I would need to know if the amount of vinegar in each cup will differ.
In order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much of each material is used before i go and find the mass. I would need to know how much vinegar to pour on each material. Although they show the materials in the data take they should still list them in the procedure.
I will need to know what's the purpose for this experiment, know the difference in mass for each sample, and I need to know an esimate of what they thought the starting and ending mass was.
They should add how much vinegar to add to each sample. For this lab to be more accurate they should have also added more trials as well as adding a constant variable such as a rock in just water.
In order to replicate this experiment I would need to know, first how to calculate the mass of the samples. I would also need t o know what the four samples are, as if is not stated in the procedure. Lastly to repeat this expirement I would need to know how much vinegar was placed into each container.
Additional information that would be needed to replicate the data would be what equipment is needed for the experiment,what materials are going to be used,and how much of each material will be used?
In order to replicate this experiment:you would need to know the amount of vinegar to pour in the container. You also need to know what to pe of coniainer to pour the vinegar in. Also, you need to know how much or how long to rinse the samples with distilled water.
After reading the procedure i would  first need to know what the for sample are that i am testing second i ^p would need to know how much vinegar put in each container next the procedure should tell me how thing to case rinse each sample in distiled water.
Determine what the different samples are, then state how much vinegar you would be adding to each sample. State how long you are rising the materials in water. (ex 5 minutes)
In order to replicate the groups experiment, I would need a lot of additional information. First of all, I would need to know what it is that they are using as the four samples (rocks bark)
"I think the experiment should make the description more specific so as not to be confused and mistake cups.For instance , they could say ""each of the cork samples"", and ""place sample  into cup labeled 'A'"""
"One extra thing that needs to be included is what material or object the four samples are of another thing not included is the amount of vinegar needed to put in each containers. The words ""A sample"" doesn't specify the exact amount of each rock are needed. A repetition of this experiment is needed to verify the results."
There could be more than 1 test for each sample. There could also have a constant added to the expariement. Also, there are to softy instanchings in the experiment like put on goggles before eyes where gloves when touching the vinegar
They should take more notes, that way, in case they mess up, they can have a the information how to redo it.
How much vinager should you pour, with what label, and when to sit it, it sitand dry for 30 min...Label. The container's reapetedly, separate but identicle conatainer. What containers should we use?
In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know what the different mauterials were. I would also need to know how many different materials there were and what the starting mass of each material was.
In the experiment  I would determine the mas of each sample pair the  vinegar into a container then label. I would wait 24 hours then pour out the vinegar and nose out with water. Let the samples dry and find the mass difference
In order to complete this experiment, three aditional thing should be included. The first is the amount of vinegar to pout in the cup. The second is to list the far samples in the procedure. The third is to record the information obtained.
In order to replicate the group's I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each of the four and how long  containers, how much the sample you need to add you need to rinse the samples.
The procedure needs to state the four types of samples it is using, (marbles, limestone, wood, plastic). You need to determine how much vinegar you are pouring into each cup. You need a set amount. You could also do the time at different times. So you could do it at is at 30 and at 45 minutes to see if there is a change at all in the mass over time.
The information I would need to replicate the experiment is; the four different samples, the four identical containers, the amount of time to let the samples sit, and the product to rinse the samples with so I could let them sit for more.
To repeat this experiment you would need to get the average that was used in the last procedure and let it sit for twenty eight hours instead of twenty four then rinse and record the changes in mass.
We need to know the exact amount of vinegar going into each container, to make sure that each sample fair results. We also need to have a set starting mass so all of the samples have the same amount or the results will not be reliable. We also need to know what kind and how big the containers are, because results may be unreliable if the containers for the samples have all different volumes and shapes.
Some additional information that you would need is how many vinegar are you pouring in. Also in step 3 it says add a sample of each material. We need to know how big the sample would have to be. Something that could effect the data could be what temperature are you putting this experiment in, is it room temperature, we need to know this.
To replicate the experiment, the procedure would require more detail. One piece of information that is omitted is the amount of vinegar used in the experiment. It is also important to know what temperature the experiment was kept at during the 24 hours. Finally, the procedure needs to include details about the experiment, for example if the whole sample must be submerged.
"You would need the amount of vinegar being poured into each of the caps. That because the experiment only tell you to ""pour vinegar"" but when people read if they might not know how much vinegar to put."
This group left same very important thing out of their procedure. First of all they didn't tell us what sumples to use for the experiment. They didn't tell us how much vinegar to use or what size containers we would need all of this information to replicate this lab.
You would need the name of the four samples you are using to make a table to record data. Write down you need to record the starting mass, ending mass and difference in mass.
Some additional information i would need is how they found the mass and what type of instrument was being used. Also when they say place a sample of the material, how much of each type am i going to need.
First of all you'll need to measure the container bxitsals and subtract it from weight of the samples so you don't accidently have extra weight. Calculate the time diffrence it took to prepare them. Use the same weight of each sample.
To exactly replicate this experiment you would have to know, how they measured the mass of the object, because without that how would we figure out the different masses. We have to know the starting mass, the ending mass and the difference in mass.
After reading the group' procedure I did not know how much vinegar they would be pouring into the containers. This group also did not state the starting time at which they added the vinegar. This group also did not state the reason the data, they just said to determine it.
I would need the amount of roch in each container. I would need the amount of vinegar of r container. I would need the same kind of vinegar in each container. I would need all of this additional information to replicate this repricant.  I would also need the amount trials done.
1.A list of materials and safety requirements. ^p 2.The amount of vinegar to put in the containers. ^p 3.The temperature of the room/vineger ^p 4.A control group.
Additional information you need in order to replicate this experiment is a control group. A control grap  should have no effect on the sample and is needed so you can base your answers off reliable sources. Also in order to replicate this experiment we need to know the amount of vinegar we are putting on the sample. We also would need to know.
What you would need is the imformation on how much vinegar is added to every sample. For example, one sample can be in a different amount of vinegar. So that can throw their ending masses off.
"We would need to know what samples they used for the experiment they just say ""samples"". We need to know how much vinegar they poured into each cup and we would need to know what units to measure the mass of the samples with. They would have to specify that we should weigh them using grams."
What the group of students did was determine the mass of different samples. So what I would do : what they did in the beginning or the investigation I would use the samples and do another experiment with the samples.
On statement 2, They need to put the measurement of the containers ^p On statmen 4 how much water? ^p On number 6 whats the measuremt were suppost to use for the mass.
Some additional information for their procedure would be to use the same amount of vinegar for each container. Also make sure the times are all on for each sample. Also measure the mass after it drys and find your difference from its starting mass.
In order to replicate ta experiment, a person would need to know a few more things. They would need to know which substances to use & how much of each one. The person would need to know how much vinegar to put in the container. They would also need to know what temperature to put ta containers in. One might also want to know what type of container, how to write down the findings.
You would need to know how much vinegar was placed in the container. What type of samples you were measuring and placing in the container and the temperature at which they were storing at to ensure equal experiment.
Additional pieces of information that shuld be included in the procedure would be, with with what would you be using to determine the mass such as a scale, have the controlled variable evident in the procedure, one last thing that should be to move a table of the starting mass, the endingmass, and the difference in mass using grams.
To replicate this experiment, you would need to know how many ml of vinegar is poured into each container. You would also need to know how much distilled water was supposed to be poured onto the samples. Also, you may want to have the starting mass of each samples be the same.
In order to replicate this experiment,I would need to know 3 more things that weren't stated in the procedure. I would need to know the amount of vinegar poured into the container,the amount of time the samples were in the vinegar and the amount of distilled water used to rinse it off.
The additional things that I would put are the procedures in what find at temperature they left the containers in. I would also include the samples of what I am testing in the experiment. Lastly, I would also put in my procedure, how much  amount of vinegar they are putting in.
In order to replicate this experiment, you must be able to know what the four materials are, how to measure the mass, how much vinegar should be poured into the containers and how much distilled water should they rinse it with. They should start by saying, d determine the mass(put the tripple beam balance), of the four diff. samples(name them), then pour vinegar(how much) into containers, then these step of step 4, wash( how much distilled water, and it would be better.
In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the size of the containers that you would place the sample in, you would need to know the amount of vinegar putting in each container, you would need to know what to use to measure out the mass (for example, tripple beam balance, etc) and you would also need to know the material to use to place each sample in the containers.
You got to put more Vinegar in wood so it make no different in mass in plastic out a little not more Vinegar so it could do more reaction.
Another trials, the amount of vinegar used and no changing of time to make sure it's accurate. Because if not youill change the experiment. By changing the most important things.
To replicate this experiment one must know information that is not given by the procedure. First, we must know how much vinegar to put into the containers, enough to cover them? Next, we need to know how the vinegar will affect the material. Will  we completely submerge it or only partially? Finally, we need to know which materials to use. The data indicates them, but the procedure does not.
Three additional pieces of information  I would need to replicate the procedure are to gather materials, use a control, and when it's finish to record the data.
In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know several more piecesof information. One of them being the amount of each material (wood, plastic, marble and limestone). You would also need to know how much vinegar to add. Finally, a constant for each material would alsohelp.
The independent varriable is the imarble, limestone wood, plastic.The marble starting point was 9.8g. The limestone was 10.4g and wood starting point 11.2.The end of the exeperiment is that you have to determine the mass of each sample.
Additional information that could be useful in order to replicate the experiment would be to list the actual samples in the procedure so you can see what your using. Secondly, in the procedures I nade need to what to weigh the mass in, for example, they didn't tell you to weigh in grams and I wouldn't be able to complete the experiment easily. It doesn't tell how much vinegar to actually pour into each container in order to replicate, I would need to know that.
I think that knowing the temperature in the envoment would be very useful, I'm sure it we heated the samples or froze the samples, we wouldn't get the same results. Also, we need to know what type of environment we should place this in. Should it be sunny, dark, windy, hot, cold, etc. I also think we should know what kind of container and how large it should be, we don't even know the right amount of vinegar to pour on the samples. This experiment is missing too much information.
In order for I for  replicate this expirement I woukd need to know what are the reaserching with this expirement what kind of result are  being booked at and the mass of each sample at the end of expirment  theie results.
In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. You would need to know how long to rinse each sample with distilled water and using how much water. You would also need to know how they determined the masses of the samples both in the beginning and end of the experiment, and they exact size of the containers that the samples are being placed in.
In order to replicate the experiment we would need a control. We would also need the four samples to use. And another thing is what can of vinegar to use and how to weigh the mass of each one. That is what we would need to replicate the experiment.
The additional information that is needed in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar that should be placed in each container. The amount of vinegar must be kept constant in order for the data to be valid. The results acquired from the experiment can be affected if the amount of vingar  was increased or decreased. Therefore, the amount of vinegar is needed in order to replicate the experiment.
In order to replicate this groups procedure, you would need to know the independent and dependent variables as well as the control group for the procedure. Also, to ma ke it more clear, they would need to include a hypothesis of the experimenting well as a purpose.
In order to replicate the experiment, the procedure would have to add more details. In the first bullet, the four samples should be stated as marble, limestone, wood and plastic. You should describe the containers where to put the samples and how much you need. There should be a step where you find the starting mass before the experiment. Also there should be measurements of how much vinegar should be added. One last thing, is when you say to determine the mass on the procedure it should say,in grams.
They should have told the samples that was used. The second thing was the outcome, what happened to the differ.
The students need to say what  the samples are. They need to
The group should of added the amount of vinegar used for control. Also they should have compared at least one more trial material before reply 2conclusion.The recommended sizes of the samples should have also been stated in order for the conclusion to be easy to compare with other group attempting to complete this experiment.
Additional information I would need to replicate this experiment would be the actual names of the samples. In step 2 I would need the exact amount of vinegar to pour into each container. Also in step 4 I would need the amount of distilled water to rinse it off with and for how long.
In order to replicate this experiment, some additional information I would need is how the grap determined the mass of the samples and what did they use to do so. I would also need to know the amount of vinegar they used to pour in each container as well as what kind of containers they used.
First off these groups of students forgot to addd in step 2 how much vinegar in going to be poured in each identical container. In step number 5 the students did not say to organize the samples so you can record it as separate data because each sample is different (marble, limestone, wood, plastic). The students also forgot to include step 7, which is find the differences in mass. If another group of students were going to do this exact experiment they wouldn't know what they are comparing.
If i was doing this experiment i would have taken the temp. of the room, i also would have given a measurement of how much vinegar i used.
After reading the groups procedure, the following additional information is needed, you need to observe the containers when you fill each with the content, you will need to make sure each container has the very same amount, then also make sure that all the containers are in the same room temp.
The additional information that is needed it the amount of vinegar being poured into each cut. Also you need to record all the information. They need to know how much water they are putting into the containers after 24 hours.
You would need the size of the container, amount of vinegar used, the types of samples. Such as earth, wood, limestone, and plastic and how much of each to put in.
In addition to the information given, you would also need to know how much vinegar to put into each container,different amounts could change the results. There should also be a set temperature to keep the samples at, because change in temperature can affect the corossion process. In the experiment, it should have told you the samples should be somewhat even size.
"Additional information that is needed in order to replicate the experiment is the measur ments of the liquids poured into the cups. Also wat size cups are the liquids poured into. In the procedure it says ""pour vinegar in each of four separate, but identical containers"". That is the additional information that is needed in order to replicate the experiment."
Some additional information they could have added was they they should have weighed the sample before they put 4 in the vinegar.
For each box, they should have done it 3 times so they would have an average.
I would need to know what materials i am getting to begin this experiment. What should i be looking for when experiment is going on? How do i determine the mas of each sement.
Some additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is in the proceeduce include, what type of samples your using, also do explain why you are using vinegar. Finally, to tell the reader what your weighing with and why.
If I was to replicate the experiment I would need to know the amount of vinegar in each container, the size of the containers, and what was used to weigh the samples.
In order to replicate this experiment, you should know how much of each sample you were supposed to start with, what you were trying to determine from this experiment and you should know how the containers were kept room temperature outside etc.
In order to replicate this this experiment youwould need the starting mass, ending mass and difference in mass.
You would need to find out and label the different sizes and shapes of the 4 samples, you don't pour the vinegar in, instead you say to drops in each container. You want everything to be the same, and when you pour you don't always get the exact amount for each container. Also state the mass of ph label of the vinegar.
Your going to need how much is there in total.
Pour vinegar in each of the four separate but identical containers.^p Place one sample in a conteiner and do the same for the rest, ^p After 24 hrs remove sample and rinse ^p Sit and drt for 30 min. ^p determine the mles.
To replicate this experiment, you would need to know the mass (amount) of vinegar used in each cup. It is also necessary to know the temperature of the room that the experiment was performed in. A different temperature could speed or slow the reaction in each cup. The last piece of information required would be he size of the cup used in the experiment. The volume of the cup and/ or the shape of the cup could completely alter the results of the experiment.
"To replicate the experiment, I would give the required tools in a list so people can be more prepared, I would also be more specific on the word ""samples"" to describe rocks and stones. And most importantly I would make a control, I would put marble, limestone, wood and plastic in water."
In order to replicate the experiment, i would need some additional information. First of all i would need to know how much vinegar to use in each container. Second of all i would need to know the materials i would be placing in the vinegar.
What you would need to know to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar to put in each cup. Also you would need to list the materials you were using. Another thing you would need to know is what measurement of the mass would you use.
You would need what semples there, what you do after number 6.
It would have been better to have had three trials for the data and to have an average for the data. Also a total of the data could have been better too.
First you would need to know what the samples are that they are talking about. Next you would need to know how much Vinegar you need to put in each container. you could also need to how long you should rinse each sample.
"The additional information I would need to radicate the experiment I would explain the look of the outcome of the experiment. I would put ""After 24 hours, remove the samples from the container & rinse each sample w/ distilled water. ""Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes. Instead of putting ""Determine the mass of each sample"". I would tell you the outcome on what happened and how the experiment turned out."
I will need to add on them subtena by how many number their are. The sample has the amount of four layers it is to divide by eight.
In order to replicate this experiment, a control would need to be established. Also, a mass would need to be determined so that every material had the same mass at the beginning of the experiment. In order to accurately replicate this experiment, it would help to know if the containers were covered or uncovered for the 24 hours.
We would word correct safety measures to take,the control,the effect of vinegar,what temperature to store them at,what the identical containers are made of and its size,what type of scale to use to meas it,the amount of vinegar in each container,i more trials
In order to replicate this experiment, there are a few more things I need to know. The problem does not state what the four different samples are. Second, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each cup. The amount of vinegar could impact the mass. Last, I would need to where to store the samples for the 24 hour period. Different tempuratures might affect the different samples.
this question would need to include the measurement of the containers & the amount of vinegar poured in each cup.
In order to replicate this experiment, i would need to know what she containers to use and how to measure the mass of the samples. I would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container.
You would need to know the portions of what they used as not to ruin the experiment, or not usin enough or too much may not give you the same results.
In order to replicate the lab, the students did you would need to know what materials were need. What kind of area are you going to do the lab in and how much vinegar you need to pour into the samples.
The additional information that is needed in the procedure is they should state what samples are going to be used. Also, they should include how much vinegar we need to pour into the container because different amounts could have different results. Lastly, It should include the size of the container because it could have a different result.
Additional information to be included into the procedure to replicate it would have to be to clarify in the first step, what the samples are going to be. It would also be good if you were to add where you should put your samples while they are sitting in the vinegar. It would have clarified the procedure also if it were added what we should use to measure the samples. It would also be helpful if the procedure included how much of each sample to test.
After reading the group's procedure, additional information that a would need in order to replicate the experiment are that a need to know the size of the containers that the samples are put in, for they need to be identical. U also need to know tha amount of samples u need to put in each container in order to obtain tha same starting mass the group of students recieved from the samples. Another factor a should know is the amount no vinegar that u pour into the containers concerning the oud example of the experiment. Another good peice of information would be the location where the samples are drying and amount of sunlight.
Some additional information needed would be where the containers are to sit. Such as in the sun or in the refrigerator. How much vinegar are we putting into containers and what kind of containers are using?
The students should say in the experiment what samples are being used. They should also say how much water they should use when they are distilling the sample and they also need to say how much vinegar they are pouring into each labeled cup.
Three additional pieces of information that I would need to know to replicate this experiment would be what exactly the four samples are of, how much vinegar to pour into each container, and what exactly the purpose or problem statement for this experiment was.  Also, how much distilled water I would need to use.
In the procedure, i would also need to know how much vinegar to use, which scale of measure they are using and how big each container is.
In order to complete this experiment, you would need additional information. You would need to know the list of materials to have everything to complete your experiment. You would also need to know where the experiment was performed to weigh any outside factors. You might also need to know to know the constants. What type of vinegar, and what time you started.
To replicate this  experiment you would also need to know vinergar they used, the size of the cup and the the size of the samples.
After reading the procedure there were a few things I need to know to replicate the experiment. One thing is the amount of vinegar used. Another is How much water to use when rinsing it. The last thing is how to store the samples for 24 hours. There were a few problems with this procedure.
I would the amount of vinegar that should be put into each cup also should the containers be covered or not? It would be helpful to know what type of containers should the materials be put into.
I need to know how big the container is & how many of them.
What are the samples/what is the material use how much vinegar is poored in the containers.
The students should have made a hypothesis of what they thought was going to happen. Also they should have stated what they were investigating. They should have made a conclusion from the results.
In order to replicate the experiment, you would need additional information like how much vinegar was poured into the separate containers, what tools to use such as safety goggles, and having more trials.
They needed to add what the samples were how the mass should be determined,they need to tell you to table the containers, and you need to record tour data.
Some additional information I would need in order to replicate the experiment would be how much vinegar do I put  in each container. Also what am I supposed to label the container? I'm not quite sure how to measure the mass by using  a scale?. If so, the same scale for each sample. Also, how big are the samples sapposed to be?.
To replicate this experiment, you would need to know the volume of the vinegar in the cup, the temperature of the surroundings, and the exact acidity of the vinegar on the ph scale.
To replicate the group experiment you would need to add information even as if the lab is valid.
You would need to add how much vinegar is needed to be poured in the container. I think the students should have started out with the same mass. What type of vinegar and does temperature matters.
Some additional information would be how much of each sample would be put into the vinegar. Also, maybe not have then sit for 24 hours, but hav then sit less. They could also have rinsed them with replica water instead of distilled water.
The additional information necessary to replicate the experiment are: ^p 1.)The amount of vinegar to pour - this must remain constant in a credible experiment. ^p 2.)The types of samples used should be in the procedure. ^p 3.)
To replicate the experiment, you would need to find out how much vinegar to pour into the containers. We know that marble lost 4 grams, limestone lost 1.3 grams, plastic lost 1 grams and wood stayed the same, but we need to know how much vinegar was used for each sample.
We had all the information we need to do the experiment, we allready know that wood is the one that has more mass out of all of them and that plastic is the least one but maybe if they would've explained it better to be able to complete the mass, because it looks like they only have estimates for the mass.
The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the difference in mass from the beginning of the experiment to the end of the experiment. You'd also need to know what all the samples were and would need the same amount of vinegar in each container.
To replicate the groups procedure I would need for them to tell the reader how much vinegar to put in the containers, how much of one sample material do they want, and how they want us to determine the mass.
There are a couple additions that should be made to replicate the lab accurately. In procedure 1, it does not say to measure the mass of the samples wi or without a petri dish. It also should say that they should be measured with a particular instrument, such as balance beam. Another part that was left out was that they forgot to tell how much vinegar the four samples need, because if one gets more than another, it might change the weight and how much water torince the samples with.
You would need to tel what type of samples they are. Also, what type of untensil to use to measure the mass of the samples. Also, would need repeat or replicating trials to re-test the experiment. Or you ll also need to tell what to label the containers by in this experiment, you 'll also need to reach the mass or how each sample looks by using your five senses, or whatever or not to make a data same to show your results.
In order to replicate this experiment I would need to know what kind of ''samples'' I am using. The group states to determine the mass of four samples but does not tell me what kind of material these samples are. Also it would be helpful to know how much of each sample I should measure. Again this groups procedure is very being detail and it would help to make the experiment as accurate as possible, to know how much of the sample I should be using. Finally in order to replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar I should add to each sample. Different amounts of vinegar will affect each sample differently, making the experiment inaccurate.
In order to be able to duplicate this experiment, you need the following information: How much vinegar to use. Also how big are the containers i.e what is what is their volume. And lastly how much of each sample to put into the containers.
Additional information I would need is how much vinegar was put onto each sample. This is because, if more vinegar is put on one sample than another it will most likely after the mass in different ways: for example if more vinegar is put on wood than plastic then wood will have more mass lost than the plastic would.
In order to deplicate this experiment, you would need to state exectly how much of a certain chemicals you need to pour. In most cases, it is imperative that you get the right amount of a substance or your results may be difficient.
To repeat this experiment, I would need to know the four different  samples without knowing that I don't know what I'm testing. I also need to know how much vinegar in each of the 4 cups. I would need to know where to put all of the different containers. I don't know if they need to stay at room temp, cold or not.
You should repeat each step in the experiment. Start with step 1 and go all the way to step 6.
To replicate this procedure you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the containers. You would also need to know when you started to know when to finish the experiment.
What materials should we use because inorder to do this experiment it has to tell us what sudstances are being used. Their procedure also does not tell us to get a starting weight.
After reading the group's procedure in order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know the size of the containers because the smaller the container, the more densely packed the samples are. I would also need to know whether or not light and heat or dark and cold will affect the experiments.
The procedure has to be more specific. It should include that the experiment needs an ending mass and the difference of the beginning and end. It should have materials listed. It should have within the procedure a mini procedure for each material.
In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know additional information such as the four different samples that they used (because I could have choosen metal, carbboard and many other sample materials that they didn't use and would get different results. Also I would also need to know the amount of vinegar to pour because this can caute a major change. Lastly, they might want to tell where to sit the samples while they dry for 30 minutes because if they are sitting in room temp. or by a light source makes a difference too.
To replicate the experiment, they would need to tell you how much vinnegar to put in the cups, have all the rocks way the same and tell us why they are doing the experiment.
To replicate the procedure i would need to know the amount of vinegar needed, how much distilled water needed to rinse the samples and the type of samples.
"These students procedure was not  a reliable one. The material needed to mention what kind of material they uses. Is there only reducing to ism the ""sample."" They also needed to know how much vinegar to pour into the cup. The material also that not  include in control groups. which is a centered post or any experiment. They student variable unchecked. They also included only the trial."
I would need to know the amount of vinegar  added to each sample which have to be the same replicate the experiment.
The additional information I would need to know in order to replicate the experiment is what kind of samples they are using. In step 1, it tells me to determine the mass of four different samples, but doesn't tell me which kind. In step 2, It tells me to pour vinegar into each container but doesn't tell me what size or type of container. After sample are removed from the containers after 24 hours, I need to find the mass of each sample. Step 6, but they don;t tell me to subtract the end mass from the slurhnf.
The group needs to add what to label because
First, I woule Say you need to get all materials before you do any of that. What would we use to get the masses of the 4 different materials and where woule we place the 4 containers while we are waiting for the results.
First, you would need to know exactly how much vinegar to pour into each of the identical containers. You would also need to know what the size and material the container is made out of. Lastly, they should tell you where to leave the containers such as in the sun, in a dry, cold place etc.
-In step 1, we need to know what samples. It should list the 4 types of rock. ^p -In step 4, how long should the samples be rinsed for an amount of time should given. ^p -In step 6, it should say to correct the new mass of each sample.
The procedure is not clear, they need to say the sample names because we don't know what it is. Also, they need to say why to measure the mass of the four different samples before putting it in the vinegar. Finally, they should repeat the experiment a several times so to see the difference and maybe they should keep the sample in the container for a longer time to see the results.
We would need observations during the whole experiment , maybe repeats of the experiment to see if anythings changed. Also try another sample.
The experiment is lacking several pieces of information about the procedure. For example the amount of vinegar added to the containers is not described. The method of determining the mass as well as the four sample materials, has not been specified in the procedural information.
1. I would have to know what kind of area I would have to leave it in for 24 hours. (temperature) ^p 2. I would have to know what kind of wood to use, if there has any specific. ^p 3. Also in step 6, it does not say what I have to use to determine the mass of the rocks, plastic and wood.
In order to replicate the experiment, you need to know what the samples are taken of, what size the samples should be, what size the containers should be, and how much vinegar is to be used on each sample.
In this group's procedure, some additional information should've been what were the labels named.
Additional information you would need would be a control to see what would happen to the mass with out vinegar. You would also need to  know the size of the containers and how much vinegar you would use.
In order to replicate the experiment i belive that the information wanted would be the starting rows, ending mass, and difference in mass. The additional information in my opinion would be how the structure changed throughout the procedure.I f you were to record this data at because the procedure would be successful to see the difference on mass in four samples
I think that they should have did the project more than once probably about two more times to see if there project was right and they also should have written out there conclusion as well as putting it on a graph.
"In the procedure you would need to add the time in which the stone / rock / plastics began to change when vinegar was added to them. They could have to explain when they would change or what time for each one :marble, limestone, wood and plastic. In the procedure it only explained ""After 24hrs"" but they didn't write down the time difference for each one they only put the overall time."
After reading the groups procedure,i found 2 more additional pieces of informotins so that i can duplicate the experiments. I need to know the independent variable, dependent variadle and how much vinegar to pour into each seperate containers.
After reading that group's procedure one additional piece of information you would need to replicate that experiment is what the four different samples were. Another thing you would need to know is how much vinegar you should put in with each sample. The last piece of additional information you would need is how big each of the samples should be.
The additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment are the mass of the containers because if you placed the substance in with the sample, in order to find the mass of only the sample, you need to subtract the mass of the container. Also it is necessary to know how much vinegar to mix in with the sample. I also need to know what type of environment to put the samples when I am waiting 24 hours. Lastly, I need to know what type of container to put the samples in because it may have an affect on how the samples react.
In order to replicate the experiment, the person performing it should do a few things differently. First, they should state what materials they are using, second, they should have a set  measurement  of how much vinegar to pour into each container, and third, they should state that you must find the difference of the starting and ending masses.
Need to know how much vinigar to put in each container, how you are going to get the mass of the sample and how they are going to calculate the difference should be included in the students procedure.
To replicate the experiment you would need to know the kind of word used. you should also need to know how long you would have to rinse the samples in the distilled water.  The size of the container would be essential as well, so you would know how much vinegar should be used.
Additional information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be for the group to explain how to determine the mass of the materials, to find out what the starting mass was, to explain more specifically how to place the materials in separate containers for less confusion, and to explain how you find the ending mass and the difference in mass.
You would need more marble, limestone, wood and plastic.
You would need the amount of vineger the samples sat in. The amount of water they where rinsed in, and the amount of each sample.
I don't know what replicate means, so I don't know how to anser this question
First, it doesn't tell the amount of vinegar to pour into the four containers. Next, it doesn't say how to allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes, maybe they need a cover for it but we don't know from this information. In addition, there is an information about how they determined the mass.
In the group's procedure, three things need to do is tell how much vinegar should be poured in the containers, how much of a sample should be added and what conditions the containers were placed in for the 24 hours.
"1. What kind of ""sample of material"" are you using. 2. How much vinegar should we put in the containers. 3. They should be more clear about how to rinse each sample."
I need to know how much vinegar. I need to pour on each of pour seperate, but dentical containers. I need to know what the four different samples are.
In order to replicate experiment Acid Rain'' you will need  get four seperate but identical containers, the materials marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. After you have these materials you need to weigh them before you put each of them in their own container, After you have these materials you need to weigh them before you put each of them in their own container. After 24 hours, rinse the solutions off and weigh the mass again.
In order to replicate this experiment ,I would need to know how much vinegar to place in each container.Also I would need to know of each sample was, are solid piece or,n  small or pieces. The greas would need to identify
They would have to add put each four different sample, in four separate, but identical containers in which you poured the vinegar. Butthey have to tell you the amount of vinegar to pour in all four identical containers.
The procedure is missing a few initial details about the experiment. There should be a control of how much vinegar is placed into each cup and the percentage of the vinegar should also be same to each cup. The group should explain more on how the samples will be washed since if they washed them in a jer a sink pieces could chip off, decreasing the mass. The group also needs to be more specific on the containers being used: whether they have atop and if they all are the same color and size.
Tools.
A desicable additional piece of information would be a control group for the experiment. The it would also be helpful to determine why this experiment was being performed, as well as knowing if the samples were covered or not, and how much vinegar to use.
In order to replicate this experiment you would have to know what the four samples are. The experiment does tell you and it would be impossible to do it without. The experiment should have told us that vinegar was a substitute for acid rain. That may confuse a person who wanted to do this lab. Also the lab should have said what type of container wether it is a beaker, test tube or a different type of container.
To replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers to insure each sample has to same amount to react to. I would need to also know which type of container to use.
One piece of information needed is write samples you will be working with in the procedure. They repeat over and over about different samples, but never once tell you what they were.The second piece of information needed is letting the people who are doing the experiment know that they must make a table and record the starting mass,ending mass and then the difference between the two for each sample. Finally the 3rd thing they should make known is how much of each sample is needed and how much vinegar you need to add and what unit of measure is being used.
The additional information that I would need in order to replicate this experiment is where do I leave the containers after I finish putting all the samples into different containers.
Additional information that would be needed for the procedure would be how someone find the mass of the samples and using what to find the mass, what are the samples;marble, limestone, wood and plastic and how to find the different in mass.
In order to replicate this experiment, i would need to know how much vinegar to put in each of the containers, how ling to rinse each sample and with how much distilled water. I think you would need to know these things because all three could affect the ending mass, therefore ruining the experiment. Also i would want to have a control group in my experiment to see if it was really the vinegar affecting the mass. So i would our water in 4 different containers and do the same thing.
The group would need to put in the materials, more information on what to do and add the measurement into be a good procedure.
The additional information I would need to replicate the experiment, is how many ml of vinigars are poured to each four seperate containers? Not only that but what is the material that is supposed to be sampled? And what are the four different samples? These are information's I need to replicate the procedure.
The first thing is why the students are doing this experiment. Then the second piece of infor mation is the amount of vinegar put in each container. The student also should of told how much distilled water was used to rinse each sample. Finally thier should be a conclusion and a list of materials.
First they should of put the amount of vinegar being used. They don't say to record there data.
Additional information that would be needed in order to replicate the experiment would be the following: ^p 1. Explain what the four different samples would be. ^p 2. Explain how much of vinegar should exactly be poured into the four identical cup. ^p 3.Another thing is for them to how much distilled water should be used when rinsing the samples. ^p 4. Indicate is a different amount of liquid with different mass of samples.
I
In order to repeat this experiment i would need to get the sample materials that they used. In this experiment they used marble, limestone, wood, plastic. The second step is to find the mass of the four samples. Then follow the procedure that they give you to do the experiment. Thats how i would do this experiment over.
"We would need to know what the investigation was, need to know what kined of ""sample"" their talking about. What they used to determine the mass. All of this information will help the reader help understaned the investigation better."
You would need to know the amount of vinegar poured into the containers, what order to put samples in & take them out (allat once?), and how long to rinse for.
You would need to know how much vinegar was used, how much distilled water was used and what kind of containers were used.
The students still need to make a hypothesis, a graph and find the difference in mass.
One piece of information I would need to know in order to replicate the group's procedure is how much of each sample did they put into each vinegar-filled container. I would also need to know how much vinegar was used in each sample container. I would also need to know how much distilled water to use when cleaning the samples. If I used different amounts of water when washing the samples, one may not be as thoroughly washed as another which could mess up the results.
Some additional information we would need in order to replicate the experiment is, how much vinegar do we pour into the containers, how do we determine the mass of the four samples and how long do we rinse the samples with distilled water.
You need limestone and marble.
The information I would need in order to replicate the experiment is after you allow the samples to stand dry for 30 minutes does it have to dry in a cool area? What type of area it has to dry in and after it sits for 30 min what happens after you determine the mass?
In order to rept this experiment they could have multiple trial. And also kep the lab going for 48 hours in place as they also need ti have a TV and DV content.They also could or tabled their data up and made a graph to show increase or decrease
In order to replicate this experiment  I need to know the materials, what kind of sample material, and why are they doing the experiment. How much vinegar rinse or how long
Determine the ending mass, determine the difference in mass. Also the mass or everything marble, limestone, wood and plastic. You would need to add up all  three masses, starting, ending and the difference in mass, then you will get the answer to all of them.
The steps that this procedure is missing would be to list & gather all materials, because you need to know what you are working with, 2nd, say how much vinegar to pour into the containers the other part that this procedure is misssing is how much distilled water do you rinse each sample with. If you don't have this information, it would make the experiment very off with validity's. The containers wouldn't be the same.
The group needs to add into their procedure the specified substances made, limestone, wood, 1 plastic instead of just saying '' different samples''. They also say determine the mass of that substances, but they need to specifically say how to determine the mass (scale).They need to  say how much vinegar rate into the containers and say what kind of containers should be used. Lastly at the end they again need to specify what to weigh the samples with, and how.
You would need to know how lag of a container to use for the samples. Also you would need to know exactly what volume the vinegar is to keep no results accurate. Finally, you would need to know how to measure the mass of the samples (what instrument to use).
To replicate the experiment,you would need to know the amount of vinegar in step 2. In step 4, a person would need to know the temperature the 4 'samples' are waiting 24 hours in. In step 3, the procedure states a sample of one material unless the 4 materials were given to the experimenter bit ready the procedure, the actual names of each of the materials should be given. Temperature for step 5 would also be good additional info as well.
I would need to know exactly how much vinegar to place in each container. What four types of materials we need for the experiment, to know that we need to find the difference between the masses of the materials before and after the experiment in order replicate the experiment.
In order to replicate this experiment you will need amount of vinegar used, the size of the container and and the amount of time used for each step of the experiment. These are 3 three important things or info that they need in order to replicate the experiment.
Some additional information the students come of included could be what type of materials were they putting in. Another piece of information is how much vinegar was put into each container. Another piece of information when to or how much was the samples weighed and how you weigh it.
In order to replicate this experiment i would have to know a few more things. One thing i need to know is the temperature at which they did the experiment. I would also need to know how much vinegar was used in the containers. Lastly, i would need to know the appropriate time for rinsing the samples.
The additional information that I would need to replicate this experiment is the marble sample, the limestone sample and the wood sample, and the plastic sample. I would follow the procedure step by step.
Additional information you would need in order to replicate this experiment is a little to show what the students are experimenting. Including writing down the data in the experiment. Make step 3 to separate steps.Also how to find the difference in mass from the starting mass to the ending mass. Another thing to make the experiment better is ti tell how much vinegar to pour into each containers.
First you would need a control. The absence of what is effecting the dependant. in this case the dependant variable is the mass of the material and the vinegar is effecting it, so the control would be the material subjected to water instead of vinegar. This group had don't write down the amount of vinegar. its very important that this amount is held constant throughout the experiment. They should also mention the mass of each material because each of them have to have the same mass in order for the results to be accurate and reliable.
There is additional information needed in the procedure to replicate this experiment. I need to know what the four starting samples are. Also, this procedure needs to include weigh the samples. I need to exact amount of vinegar put into each sample. Lastly, at the end you need to weigh the samples out again to measure the difference in weight.
Three aditional peace of information you need is what typ of vinegar and at what PH. Also the lb of the samples.
You would need to put the objects needed to sample this experiment. Also you need a hypothesis and a conclusion.
They need to state how much vinegar to pour in each container, what kind of samples to use and how much testing needs to be done after 24 hours.
what additional information that may be needed in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar before the experiment, also the amount of vinegar after taking each sample out of the cup. However, including information about time wouldn't hart the econ't either.
1. Firstly, the group could provide more information about the materials such is what they are, how big they are, what category the material needs to be in order to conduct this experiment ^p 2. The group does not explain how much vinegar should be poored into the container- how much is needed? ^p 3. The group does not tell what should be used to take out the sample from the container. Even though this is just vinegar, their procedure does not follow the safety rules of the lab. Goggle inclusion would also be rise.
The procedure should include what 4 samples they are testing. They need to include the ammount of vinegar in each up in metric format. The way of massing the sample should be clearer and should also explain that each sample should be massed sepparately.
Additional information that you will need in order to replicate the experiment was how much vinegar was put into container. How long do you rinse the samples ? Do the samples stay outside or inside ? Day or night ?
To replicate the experiment you would need to know the following information, what are four samples? You would need to know that so the experiment will be the same. They should also include the amount of vinegar that you need. The last thing they should include is are you pouring it on the sample or just in the container?
In order to replicate the experiment I will need to know how much vinegar goes into the containers. Also I would need to know what kind of samples they are using for this experiment. And finally, I need to know if it is weighed in grams, pounds or any other measurement.
In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in the four separate containers. You would also need to make sure you put the same amount of vinegar in each container. The last thing you would need to know is how much sample to put in the containers, and make sure its the same type of sample you used at any time.
The additional information that would be needed in order to replicate the experiment the number of trials they did in order to do the experiment, the amount of vinegar to put in the containers, the different samples they used (needs to be stated in procedures), and the amount of the sample placed in the container.
You would need to add observations, you would also need to add the time on the table.
The additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment would be how long the test samples would stay inside of the containers. You would also need to know what substance is also mixed in with the vinegar. You will also need to have 4 containers and they have to be labeled by which substance is inside of the container.
In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know the mass of it with the distilled water.
In order to replicate the experiment the group will have to start over again by determining the masses of the marble, limestone, wood and the plastic. Pour the vinegar into their containers. Place the materials into the containers and wait 24 hours. May be the mass will be differet may be it will be the same.
There is some additional niformation i would need in order to replicate the experiment, first i would need to know what the four different samples are. Second i would need to know how much vinegar i should pour into the ontainers. Third, i would need to know what type of container i should use. Last, i would need to know where to keep the containers during the 24 hours. These are the things i would need to know to replicate the experiment.
"The other information I would need to replicate this experiment is, what do we use for the samples? How much each ""samples"" do we use? and how do we determine the mass of each sample?"
After reading this group's procedure, I found that they left out the amount of vinegar that was added to each cup. This information is vital because if this experiment were to be replicated the results would vary among other replications from the original test, the data obtained from a replication of this experiment it would be false and the procedure couln't be replicated. Therefore, it is clear that the amount of vinegar poured in each cup is vital information to this experiment.
The first thing that I would need in order to replicate the acid rain experiment, is my 4 different samples. The next thing I will need is the vinegar to pour on our 4 samples the last thing I need is a slaceal to measure the start mass (g) and the ending mass(g) to find out the difference in mass(g).
I guess follow the steps to make the experiment is risht, like allow to Dry in 30 min. 2 let it be separate with the vinegar the little containers. 3 Go over to make sure nothing goes wrong.
The students need to include what the samples were. You can't do an experiment if you don't know what you're testing on. The students should also include the temp. that the containers were stored at for 24 hours. Lastly, they should include how much vinegar was poured into each container. They could've put the same amount or different amount. They could've put little or a lot.
The addition information that I would need is how many steps we will need to do to get data. What is the best container to put the sample in and does it have  to be the sume kind of container. I would also need how much many times you need to rinse the sample.
In order to replicate this groups experiment we would need to know the pH of the vinegar, how much vinegar was used for each samples and specifics such as the type of material used, ie. balsa wood compared with pine or type 2 or type 3 of plastic.
To replicate this experiment you would need to have a list of materials so you would know which samples to use, you need to know how large the samples are, and you need to know why you are doing the experiment.
If trying to replicate this experiment, you would need more information. You need to know how much vinegar to poor into the containers. You will also need to know what to label your container. How do you determine the mass of the samples when trying an experiment, you need  to make sure that you have all of the correct  information before starting your project.
In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know the materials your using. This procedure does not state the materials needed so you have no idea what to put in the containers full of vinegar.
The students did not make it clear as to what materials they used as samples. They also didn't specify how much of each sample. They also did not indicate why the mass was lost or where it went.
Some additional information that's needed in order to replicate this experiment are the names (kinds) of each sample, the measurements of each sample poured into the containers, and the amount of vinegar poured into each container as well.
Some information that is missing that they don't say what size of containers, and they don't say what to do with data.
In order to replicate the procedure of the experiment you would also need to know how much vinegar they used, and if it is the same for all of them. You would also need to do another trial, as the extra information would validate the experiment more.
To replicate the experiment I would need to know how much vineger is being poured in. I would also need to know if the mass should be the same for all student samples. Lastly how much of the sample should be getting added to the container, weather or not all of it or half of it should be added.
To tell the amount vinger you pour into the container, the size of the container, Ho long you rinse the sample off with distilled water. How many times you repeat each sample to get down to a writer mass.
This procedure should state the materials that they are using to gather the materials. First it has to say to put on their eye protection. It also needs to state how one would go about determining the mass of the four samples. Lastly, there needs to be a step on how to find the difference in the masses and to remind the reader to record their results.
1)Say what you are trying figure out in the first place. ^p 2)It's not enough into figure out what is going on. ^p 3)We need to know more clearly how to do each step.
First I would add that the students might want to add a list of materials that they need. A hypothesis and write a question to what there trying to figure out.
In order to repeat the students procedure they need to tell how much of each sample is to be placed into each cup. They also should state how long the samples are to be rinsed. If there are different amounts in each cup the experiment will not be valid.
They did not tell us what to measure with, they also did not tell us how much vinegar to put in or how big of containers.
In order to replicate this experiment I would also need materials I would use. I would need the amount of vinegar in the container, and I would also need time limit to do the test.
Some information I would need to know is how would the water be if
To replicate this experiment, I would need to know more information. I would need to know the hypothesis on what is going to happen. Also, I don't know how much vinegar to pore in each cup. This procedure also should specify what materials to use, line what brand of cups or size.
The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar they pour into the four seperate containers. They also forgot to say the amount of water they needed to rinse each sample.
First they should list the samples they used. Marble, limestone, wood and plastic in their procedure. They should also mention how much vinegar to pour on each sample to have the same effect. They should have also said to put their containers in same sort of cabinet, as a refrigerator, or somthing. Not just leaving it out of their processes.
in order to complete the experiment you would need to know each temp. by hour bic it's recorded after a 24 har period. You would also need to know the mass before it was left to ary for 30 mins.
To add to the experiment design, the group should keep the amount of vinegar and containers as controlled variables. Following this, you will
Additials information that would be good to now is, why are the students performing this xpirement? Why arent there cups a for measures for distiled water amounts, or vinegar amounts? You should also know why the starting mass for the materials all arent the same.
To replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar the group poured in each container without knowing the amount of vinegar I would get different results.
You will need more mass and you have to dry it for 30 minutes. After 24 hours, remove the samples from the containers and note each sample with distilled water. You will probably need more of a little bit of everything.
The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment are what to use to determine the mass, which would be a triple beam balance. You would also need to know the amount of the sample that would be needed to more in step 3. You would also need to know what the 4 samples you are testing are. Those samples would be marble, limestone, wood and plastic.
In order to replicate the group's experement, I would need the following information,  what  the 4 samples  are, how much vinegar to put into each containers and how much of each sample.
The information that is needed to replicate this experiment would be that firstly they need a hypothesis. Secondly, they need to list all objects they used, lastly they need to state weather their hypothesis was/wasn't correct.
The group of students should add a control to see the different between the samples and the control. In the experiment procedure also doesn't put the different samples of four like (marble, limestone, wood, plastic) The purpose of this experiment should be a group of student what is the different samples of the mass of flour after let them dry for a certain time.
To replicate the experiment , you would need to know the size of the containers, the amount of each material to start with, and the amount of vinegar used.
I would need the amount of vinegar to put in each container. How long to rinse it in water (materials). And what kind of container casinial use.
In order to replicate this experiment,you must also know how much vinegar goes in each container, how the mass is being determined and where the containers should be put for the 24 hours( what type of climate).
To duplicate this experiment you would also need to know the brands of all the products on its accurate, the environment the experiment was in and what kind of scale was used so that the replicate experiment is  identical making it move accurate.
The additional information that I need in order to replicate the experiment is the names of the specific 4 different samples. I also need to know how much vinegar is needed. Furthermore, I need to know the amount of each sample needed. Finally, this procedure does not explain how to determine the mass of each sample.
To replicate this experiment additional information you would need is a time chart to keep track of time.
Their are three things wrong with this procedure. One is, they did not table the four identical containers, the second is, they need to tell how much vinegar is needed. The third mistake is how long do we rinse with distilled water.
To replicate the experiment i would need to know what to do to the control. Also i would need to know how much vinegar needed to give into each separate containers. Lastly i would have mll of the samples be the same weight because their experiment does not have and of those listed.
One piece of information that would be helpful to know is how much vinegar do we put in the container. Another piece of info is at what temperature do we let it sit. And lastly it would be useful to know whether it should be in the light or the dark.
You will need to place the sample in one container and repeat with the remaining samples in a single container. After the 24 hours is over remove samples and rinse. Have the samples sit and dry for 30 min.
Additional information you would need in order to replicate this experiment is tell us the four different samples how much vinegar is needed to be poured into the for different containers and what should they be labeled.
You would need the information to know how much vinegar to pour into the container, the information to know which sample had the greatest difference in mass, and the information to which material to use in step 3.
Three pieces of procedure would need to be further explained in order to replicate the experiment. First is how much vinegar should be alloted to each individual cup, as different amounts of the substance may have different effects on the samples. The next bit of info would be the size and shape of all samples, though the mass is given the surface area of each material is not. Third is the conditions that the cups must be put in during the 24 hour wait period. Should they be covered or placed in a concentrated environment ? Factors like this can have a large effect on the experiment.
This experiment is not right because they would need to tell how much vinegar they put in each cup and it will have to all be the same.
The information the students left out was the control. The control of the expiriment was the actions of the vinegar in the water that affacted the samples.
Additional information that would be needed to replicate this experiment is how much vinegar to use and how much of each material to put into the vinegar. Also the experiment  doesn't  say how to remove the materials from the vinegar.
After reading this procedure i think it would need task needed. Tell what it is you are doing and what solution, and a hypothesis.
"The first thing they should have done would be to change the first thing i.e the procedure to ""gather materials"". This lets people know what materials your using. Also, this procedure wasn't worded clearly. Like 2 ""pour vinegar into 4 separate but indentical containers"". That makes no sense and is hard to understand. They also never tell you how they got the mass of the samples."
The additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is to mention what the four different samples are, tell how much vinegar was used in each container and how many remaining samples are going to be used.
They didn't include the temperature of the containers. They didn't have trials of testing.
You would need to know how big the measure were do the samples sit to dry.
The group should be more specific including the names of the samples(Add rain sample1,2,etc.). They should specify what kind of container to pour the vinegar into in step 2. In step 4, they should say where to put the samples after they have been removed from the container.
In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers because if one sample had more vinegar in its container it might lose more mass. Also I need to know what should I do with the containers once I've labeled them. The experiment's results might change if we are supposed to cap the containers or heat them, you don't know what to do. Lastly, how much water should I rinse the samples with, if different amounts are used, the weight could differ.
If I a just looking  at the people and I was to repeta this experiment  I would need to know what the four different samples  were,  does the distilled water need to be a after temperature, and how much vinegar  do i add to the samples.
To replicate this experiment, the reader needs to know what kinds of samples to use, how much vinegar to use and what kinds of containers to use. The procedure is very vague. A scientist would need much more specific information in order to perform the experiment. Therefore the students should specify the marble, limestone, wood + plastic. They should also specify the amount of vinegar needed as well as the type of container that should be used.
In order to replicate this experiment, the mass of 4 different samples should be held constant there should be a control group. The experiment should include how many times the containers were rinsed, and if it was rinsed with cold, hot or warm water it should also include where the samples were kept and the temperature, they were kept at. Also what was the group  investigating in should be included.
How much vinegar you pour into the cups. What kind of vinegar you use.What kind of containers you should use.
To make this procedure repeatable, we would first need to know the four samples we would be working with. Otherwise, we couldn't even start the experiment. We would also need to know how much Vinegar in ml to pour in the cups.
To replicate the experiment I would need additonal information. For example, how much vinegar should be poured into each container? I would also want to know the size of each sample, and make sure the surface area of each is as close to equal as possible. Lastly, I would want to know how much distilled water to rinse each sample with. With this information I am certainly capable of repeating the experiment.
After reading the groups procedure, I was left wondering what are the four different samples they are pouring. All they tell us is vinegar. Also, what is the size of the containers? How much of each sample is being poured into the container? The group would need to tell us these facts so we can follow their steps to do the same experiment.
I think from reading the procedure they should've added information describing the look before and after (see if there were any physical changes). If something was to change, then the group should've got it down so we know the features of the items.
After reading the groups procedure, to replicate this experiment, I would need to know the exact amount of vinegar to pour into each sample so the results are acurate. They would also need to include the four samples names, marble, limestone, wood and plastic. So I know what everything what everything is so I can create a data table. They would also need to include in the procedure that when massing the substances, I would first need to zero the containers on the scale and then bar the sample in.
More information is needed, more steps because its not enough to direw a conclusion. Not many materials are listed.
3 pieces of information I would include to replicate ths procedure would be to pour less vinegar in each container, let samples sit and dry for 30 min and leave samples for 20 hours. I choose that to see if anything different would happen to the mass then what happened to it the first time they tried this experiment.
I would still want to know what they were doing this experiment, how large were the samples and what was used to measure the work samples.
In order to create do able experiment you would need to add a material list describing the items needed and how much of each. Also independent and dependent variables and a hypothesis to back up your research.
You would need to know how much vinegar should be poured into each of the four containers, you should also know what the acidity of the vinegar is so  that you wouldn't use a stronger or weaker PH level. You would also need to know if you need to incubate the containers so that their environments remain constant.
The additional information you need to replace the experiment. You need limestone, wood and plastic, marbles. You test all of them in different containers. It will give you the mass of the experiment. That is what it need to replace the experiment.
How much of the material did they put into each container. Was there a controlled part of this experiment. Did they conduct a graph for this experiment.
I would say one piece of information they forgot was the amount of vinegar they put in each procedure.
In the procedure, it would be best if they said the amount of vinegar to pour onto the samples and which samples do you use in the sample. Finally, additional information that should be added would be, telling where to keep these samples, where it's cold, room or hot temperature.
How much vinegar would you pour in each cup. What temperature would the samples be in,would it be the same or would it be different? how would also need to know if they used the same size cup. These things are all very important information that wasn't included.
The additional information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be, what kind of containers do they want us to use? You would need a sample of each of the substances. As well as knowing what type of each substance you need. Last you would need the vinegar to pour into each of the containers, which changes the mass of each sample.
Some additional information that I would need to replicate this experiment would would be amount of vinegar, size of the containers, and the temperature.
In order to replicate this experiment the amount of vinegar used in each separate container must be known. Also, the type of container is not specified nor is the number of pieces of the samples that should be tested stated. All of these need to be known in order to replicate the experiment.
In order to replicate this experiment more information is needed. For example, there has to be clear statement of problem. This procedure doesn't explain why they were finding out the mass of four different samples. Also there has to be information  on how much vinegar they put in each container that way we can replicate the experiment.
The additional information it would need would be the
To replicate this experiment you would need to add what scale weight rocks with. You will need a more detailed procedure with a lot of steps so what youcan know what you have to do.
Some information that could be added  could be temperature of the vinegar or water, you could also add  how much vinegar  you add, another thing to add would be a list of possible samples.
Something that the group would need to do in order to make the procedure better is make sure one step is always gather materials. This insures that who ever has to do the experiment gets everything before they start. Second make the sets easier to understand, step 3 is very hard to interpret. Lastly make sure you clean up them at the end.
First I would need to know what they used to determine the mass. It would also be helpful if they put the 4 different kinds of materials they used in the actual experiment procedure. In case there was no data table present. They could also more specific as to what exactly they kept the samples in and where they put them. So I would no not to keep them in direct light for shade for that matter. I would also need to no how much of each material to use.
I believe that in order to replicate we would need the design of the experiment and when we
To replicate their experiment I would need to have take their their procedure and use them. I would also need their samples from their procedure and then be capable to copy their experiment. All these need are the true basic's.
To replicate the experiment there would need to be a control group which is what didn't receive the treatment and in this case didn't receive the vinegar, needs to be more clear. It says pour vinegar into a container but it's not specific as to how much vinegar. Also how much of the sample that will be used isn't stated.
In order to replicate this expiriment, you would need to know, how much vinegar you should distribute into the container, how long you should run thewater on it for rinsing, how much of the each material you need.
To replicate the experiment you would need to know what the material (samples) were, (marble,limestone,acid and plastic). You would also need to know the amount of vinegar that was placed in the cup and you would need to know what you are weighing the mass in which is grams. If these three were added to the procedure,then you could replicate the experiment.
To replicate the expirement I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup and how much of each sample.
To me I think that this experiment will need to tell what you have to repeat in the bottle and give more examples about what they are doing to make this experiment working.
I would also have to know how much vinegar to put in the cups as for as (ml). Where do I put the cups in the sun or refridarter, where do I let the samples dry in the open or the outside.
After reading the group's procedure it states that you first need to determine the mass of the four different samples, then pour vinegar in a container and after 24 hours remove the samples from the containers and rinse each with distilled water. In order to replicate this experiment, I would have to know how much vinegar should be added to each container with the samples.
To replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar was put in each container, how much distilled water each sample was washed with, and the size of the containers.
After reading the group  procedure the additional information I would need to replicate the experiment is what material are are the 4 different samples make of it is not listed in the procedure,how much vinegar should I pour in each container more or less could affect how much mass has ended ,what shape the sample were in in shape with there surface, we would have  more contact with  the vinegar, ending It RIGHT   and the mass  of the starting material if it was to replicate to experiment or repeat the exactly i would need   know  how much of each sample was used.
To replicate the experiment it would put how much vinegar to pour on each container. It would also put what effect of materials its going to use.
In order to replicate this procedures, you would need to know
In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know what the samples were. Also, step three in their procedure is a little confusing and to replicate this experiment they may want to give a little bit more directions and be more specific. They might also want to say what size containers to use or how much vinegar to add to the container to allow someone also to replicate.
Addition information that would be needed would be how much vinegar you pour in the separate containers. Another thing that would be needed is the types of racks, because the grap didn't specify the different samples in the procedure, the group would also need to tell you what you are using to determine the mass of the samples before and after, for example, they could have said to measure it in grams.
In order to replicate the experiment after reading, you will need to know what the 4 different samples are. You will also have to know how much vinegar to pour in each container. You will have to rich what the measure is when you are let it sit for the 24 hours.
Additional information would be doing the experiment 3 times before putting the data down.
I would need how much vinegar im putting in the containers, what kind of  lime and plastic, like where it came from and what kind of temperature should the samples dry in.
Some additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment is what are the four different samples ? How much vineger do you have to pour into each container. And how many trials are needed to get more accurate data. We need those information to know how to do this experiment.
My opinion is to not change anything because it seems alright it has the 4 samples and the procedure presents the table.
You need to repeat the the experiment 2 more time, record all data then compare them to see of samples have any change. Also backround information is important to any experiment.
In order to repeat this lab exactly as they did, I would need to know what materials I'd need, for example, the marble, wood, limestone, plastic was not writen in the procedure.
In order for you to replicate the experiment, you would have to change the time usage to see if there would be a different outcome. Also in step 2 where it says to pour vinegar in each of the four containers, change how they are using vinegar and substitute it for another liquid to see if these would effect anything. Lastly, I would suggest to use another sample or as many as possible to get the most accurate answer.
In this procedure the group calls the materials samples, instead of calling them samples they should have named the materials like they did in the chart. When they just say samples,that can mean anything. In step number one they should say why you need  to determine the mass of the four materials.
After you determine the mass of the products, go back and see of your thesey was correct. Then go and daght a lab report about QV. Then when your done, hand it Qn.
In order to replicate the experiment for acid rain, you need  additional information. First you need to know what type of samples your using. Second, the procedure did not specify  how big each samples should be. Having different sizes might change the results. Lastly when rinsing the sample under distilled water, you  should know what temperature to use very hot or very cold water might also change the results.
The additional information needed to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar poured on each of the samples.Also they would need to include a step in the beginning that asked for the scientist to measure the mass of each sample + finally they would have to tell the scientist what type of container to do the experiment in + whether this was the same for each sample. These additional steps + details would help create accuracy + consistency for all who completed the experiment.
I think one thing would be that we might need to know what the purposes of this experiment would be, anther is they didn't put in the procedure the names of materials we are using and a last thing would be is we might need a scale to measure the difference in masses.
Some additional information you would need to know is what samples you have to place in the vinegar. In order to complete the investigation you would need to know how to weigh the sample and what to use to do it. You also have to do some math to get the difference in mass.
To repeat in experiment doing the group procedure I would need to know how much of the vinegar to pour into each container. Another information
To replicate the experiment, I would need to know the amount of vinegar use in each cup. I would also need to know the amount of distilled water for their more explanation 3 must be better explained.
I would need to know how much samples I need for this experiment. I would need to know how much vinegar I am pouring into each container. Also, I would need to know if I am letting the samples dry in the sun or not. Without these, I could not replicate this experiment.
I would need to know, how much vinegar was used, how big the containers are and if each sample should be the same mass.
More you could repete the expierement just see it.
First the experiment needs to have  a controll. They need to put the materials in water to see if it has any affect on the materials. Second they need more than one trial for each material. I suggest three so you recieve better data. The third thing they can do is tell us exactly how much vinegar they are putting into each sample.
The limestone have mass than all of them.
You would need the amount of mass from start to last and you will need vinegar, distilled water and some other materials.
In order to replicate the experiment the reader would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers. You would also need to know if the starting mass for each sample should be the same. Finally, you would need to know how and where to store the samples during the 24 hours.
To replicate this experiment we would need to know what type of samples we are determining the mass for. We would also need to know the amount of vinegar to put in each cup. We would also need to know how to dry them at is by cloth or air drying. And we would need to know the mass of each material before the vinegar.
We would need to know how much vinegar we put into each cup. Also we would need to know how much or each sample to use, and which materials. We would also need a control. So would need to place something in regular water as well.
This experement didn't have a controle and the grupe didn't do multiple triles. You would also may need to know what tempriture the rome is.
You will need the type of vinegar and know the size of the sample. Also you ll need to know with how much water you have to rinse them.
Some additional information thats needed in this experiment, acid rain would be explang more in detail about how to use the steps, ow also should explain what each material is and lastly explain what sample means in differc! ways. This experiment snoch be more cleares and you should include a graish. This experiment doesnt make a whole lot of sene filvel.
In order to replicate this experiment the type or sample would need to be indicated in the procedure in addition the size of the containers would need to be used. Also the amount of material placed into each containers would need to be indicated.Lastly, the amount of vinegar added into the container should be included.
To replicate this experiment you will need the following vingar, to your in each identical container, you will need to let the sample sit and dry for30 minutes. After 24 hour remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water.
In order to replicate this experiment you would have to include the measurements of liquid to pour in each containers, to identify each of the samples of decks you are putting in the container and label the containers.
To replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much of the sample to put in each container, where they stored the containers for 24 hours, and where they put each sample when they removed them from the containers and rinsed them with distilled water and let the sit and dry for 30 minutes.
Some additional information would include: The amount of vinegar poured into each container, mass of the sample taken and the temperature where the 4 containers were stored for the 24 hours.
The procedure should include what the mass should be and how to get it. Also you do not know what the four samples are. In the second step how much vinegar should be poured. In the thats step it should explain how to get the mass and how to record it so it is neat and understandable. A last step should  also be included to say repeat.
After reading the procedure, I would need to know the materials the students are using. I would also need to know why they are doing the experiment, what is the purpose? what kind of containers are they using and how big are they?
additional information that you would need in order to replicate this experiment include the amount of vinegar poured  into each container, where the containers are stored or kept for 24 hours, how the samples should be dried, and lastly, with what should the masses be taken on.
For one thing to replicate the experiment one would need to know how to determine the mass and the group must state how to do this in their procedure. They also should state to use, the same mass objects so that it is easy to replicate. Finally, the group should use a control to compare their results to and for replication of the experiment.
You would need to state that wood didn't lose any mass, the plastic lost 1 of mass, the marble lost 4 of mass and the limestone lost 1.3 mass. Then you would say that limestone loses the most mass and wood lose the least mass.
In order to replicate this experiment there are few additional pieces of info they should have included. One thing should have included is how rough vinegar they poured into each container. If there was more vinegar in one container then the other them one with more would lose mass readily. Another thing they would have included is a control without a control, there is nothing to compare your results to. One last thing that is is necessary to repeating this experiment is you must know how much of each sample that you used. If you use more of one sample than another, then of course it is going to way more. Each sample should be the same size.
The students should include in their procedure what shape the samples are in, are they all solids in the same shape, or are they ground upp the ammount of surface area will affect the rate of disintegration of the samples. Also, they should state how much vinegar should be put into the containers, and that the ammount of vinegar in each container should be the same. What type of vinegar it is should also be included.
A hypothesis was needed in this experiment. Also, the group should had told the reader what was happening, why the experiment was taking place. Also they should had repeated the steps at least three times to make sure the results where accurate.
Additional things a I would need to replicate this experiment is a clock or a stop watch to time how long the samples sit and dry.
You would first want to know why this experiment was being conducted, what results where they looking for. You should also need to tell how much and what type of vinegar was being poured into the solutions. Equal masses of each solution as the starting mass would also be
You would need 1). More trials 2). Different types of samples and 3). Maybe have have to samples sit and dry for more than 20 mins.
The additional info I would need to replicate it is, marble, limestone, wood, plastic, water, container, vinegar, label.
The group would need say what the four samples are in the procedure. They need to tell you how much vinegar to pour in each container. The group also does not tell you how to way each sample's mass.
Limestone you would need because it's the most important of then it won't work when you used it.
They need to repeat every step that already preformed.
In order to replicate this group's procedure, I would need the following information: ^p 1. When they say in step one that they need to determine the mass of four different samples, they should name and list the samples that they plan on using. ^p 2. In step two when they say to pour vinegar in each of the four separate but identical containers, they should make mention or how much vinegar we should pour in. ^p 3. When they say in step  four that we should rinse each sample with distilled water, how much water should we use and how long should we rinse.
In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar you put into each sample. You would also need to measure them at the exact time because the one you measure last might grow a little more because it was sitting longer.
In order to replicate, the group students experiment the additional information i would need to  encure, how big the four identical containers were, how big is sample of each four materials that they put into the container where they placed the containers in a warm or cold environment. How much vinegar and the students pour into each container.
The iddtional information that I would need in order to replicate the experiment are the following:what changes had each sample after sitting 24hrs. And the 2 one would be what was the exact amount of vinegar,we pour in each four separete but equal containers how did and last what was the outcome of this investigation. What did we learn
In order to replicate the group's experiment, there is additional information that would need to be known, such as how much vinegar was poured into the four seperate containers, how much of each sample is used and what the group used in order to determine the mass of each sample.
In order to do this experiment again, you would need to know the exact mass of the 4 samples, what kind of samples they are and how long you have to rinse the samples for.
Some additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar poured into each seperate containers. If I did not have the data table, I would also need to be told in the procedure what the four different samples are. It would also be helpful to know what type of containers were used. In order to replicate on experiement, the procedure must be precise and not have any information out, or else the data may come out completely different and not be comperable to the first set of data.
In order to replicate the experiment, i would need to know the quanity of the variables (sample materials). It is neccessary to know how the samples were rinsed w/ distilled water use. Were they put in a diff container or just held under a steam of water, mostly evapoltantiy I need to know how they determined the mass of the samples, what was their tool of measurement.
In order to repeat the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar was needed in each container, how big each sample should be and where to store the experiment for 24 hours so that the experiment does not get ruined & due to the sorroundings it was in.
You would need a control to look back on, you would need to know how much liquid you would need to fill each container ip with and get the time right. With the days and stuff you would need to know all your materials.
What was the purpose for them doing this experiment? ^p Why did they choose to set up there lable this way? ^p And for me to replicate the procedure would be impossible due to the fact that there's no problem also there not alot of information provide that examples the directions.
It doesn't tell you what they are trying to figure out with the investigation. So we would be able to do the work, but I would know what we did if for after.
If there is a control they would need to identify it, they should also tell the type of material, tell the mass' unit of measurement.
Additional information needed in order to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar needed to pour into each of the four separate containers. Also the type of containers that that amount of vinegar should be placed into . Also, although indicated in the data table, the students should put into their procedures the types of the four different samples and the starting amount of each and what form they are in. Should it be poured limestone, a block of wood etc. And also they should indicate how much distilled water to rinse the samples with at the end. All of these additional information would be needed in order to replicate the experiment.
You should in all procedures out in an actually experiments.
One step that missed was to gather all all the materials. Another  step  that should add is how much vinegar to put each cup. Another step they might have to add as well is  how much distilled water that would be to one each errape.
In addition to this experiment the group should include what they would use to find the mass of these rock samples.
After reading the groups procedure, I think they should have added record the data, get materials, observe the expariment and repeat expariment.
In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know what the samples experhar in the procedure are without this information I could use amthing as the samples that get completely difference showa.
I would write how much vinegar was put into each of the test tubes. Also I would repeat the experiment again to see if the information that I have is accurate and write why these is vinegar being added to each of the four samples.
They should have said how much of each sample they put in each containor.
The additional information that I would need is to add another independent veriable to the procudure other than venegar to see if it has the same effect on the samples as well as the effect on vinegar. Also  to repeat the steps more than once to make sure that they are getting the same information as the first time. Then we can come to the concusion and find that the vinegar has more effect on limestone them the rest of the samples.
After reading the group's procedure, some good additional information would be what the containers are made of, the dependent variable, and the dependent variable.
First off, I'd need to know maybe the material of each sample
In this experiment an additional iformation to perform the experiment would be that the amount of vinegar is poured into the container. This may effect the amount of mass lost fom the samples. I also think placing them in certain places with different temparatures effects how much the samples would loose mass.
This group is lacking a control group in their procedure. Also, they should have been more specific as to the size of the identical containers. Next, the group should have carilified what 4 kind of samples were needed in step 1.
First, I would need to know what amount of vinegar to pour in each container. Also, I would need to know what the environment is the sample stored would: be stored in over the 24 hour period. ^p Lastly, I would need to measure the mass of the four different samples and the volume of the liquids.
In order to replicate this experiment, you would first need to know how much (volume or mml) you would need to pour into the containers. Also, you would need to know how much specifically you would need to rinse the containers.Nothing B messed up in the experiment. And step 5 does not explicate how to d it, does the experiment want the containers to have the same area, it does not explicate.
There are many things needed in this procedure in order for someone to replicate it. First, step 1 says, determine the nose of four different samples.They should have said what the samples were of. Second, step 2 says, pour vinegar but it does not say how much vinegar. Third, there is no control in this experiment. They should have tested each sample with no vinegar for a control.
"Additional information you would need in order to replicate this experiment is: How much vinegar to pour into each container. It should say what each ""sample"" is in the procedures. A list of materials."
In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know how big samples to use. You would also need to know the problem or what you were testing for in the experiment.
In order to replicate the experiment , the group's procedure would need to specify what unit of measurement to measure mass in (g), to specify which samples were being used( marble,limestone,wood, of plastic). and specify the size and type of the containers used (beakers)
Additional information need in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar was poured into the four separate containers, should I buy the materials or use natural resources.
If I has to replicate the expinment, I would need to know what types of samples are being used and also if you check it in between the start and stop sign. Also, how do you determine the mass.
This information needs to be added to the procedure in order to replicate the experiment; ^p -Amount of vinegar poured ^p -Identify types of samples used in the procedure ^p -Temperature and ^p -Size of containers_open/closed lid
After reading this procedure, I would advise these students to make step 3 easier to understand. In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to label what material is going into the container, what you're labeling it, and what single sample enters the container in the end. Also, to make this experiment more reliable, you would need to add more trials to your procedure. Also, if you were just looking at your procedure and not the table, you would need to identify the four samples in step one.
One thing they should do is explain why they are testing viniger. Also they should have a hypothisis.
You would need to add materials that you need to use. You also would want to know how much vinegar you should pour in the cups. You should also say what you should label the container with if it should be the sample or letters like A, B, C, D.
In order to find the starting mass and ending mass of the containers, you would need to use some sect of measuring material, like a scale, to know the affects of vinegar on the material, you also need all starting mass of materials to be the same mass.
To replicate the experiment you wood need to no what materials they used for the experiment. Also you wood need to no how much vinegar they put in each of the containers. Finally you wood need to no what size the container is so that you can tell how much of the vinegar is tuching it.
"In the first step the group needs to be more precise on what they are saying for example, the could say, ""Determine the mass of 4 different rock samples"". I also think they say sample too many times. You get confused about what they are saying. One last piece of additional information the need to put is how much vinegar to pour into the container."
Where do you place the vinegar and where does the marble go in the experiment . Why do you need vinegar? Where does the acid come from?
After reading this group's procedure I think they should have used more than four samples so they coold find out different sources from other types of stone. Also I think they should have one more trials.
In order to replicate this experiment, I would first need to know how much vinegar was poured into each container so I don't put in too much or too little. I would also need to know the size of the containers they used because bigger or smaller containers could affect how the vinegar affected the 4 samples and lastly, if I had only looked at the group's procedure, I would need to know what four samples the students used so that I could replicate the experiment. And then, I would need to know where the containers were kept so I could give mine the same amount of light and other things.
After reading the groups procedure, i determined that in order to replicate the exeperiment additional information is needed. First, the procudere doesn't state what is being tested, we need to know what specific samples are being refered to next we haven't been told how much of each sample is required in the individual containers. Lastly, we need to know how much vinegar is needed in each container.
The additional information that would be needed is determining the mass of four different samples, which is the marble, limestone, wood and plastic. The information that is needed is the starting and ending mass.
In order to replicate this experiment, the groups would have to list the 4 different mass samples, if not then a person might use any different mass samples. Also the group would have to list the controlled variables such as the size of each weight sample. Lastly to replicate this experiment the group would have to state how much vinegar they are putting into each containers, to make this procedure replicateable, the group would have to make these change.
Three pieces of additional information that I would need are as follows. First, how much vinegar are they pouring in the containers? Secondly, how large should the samples be? The last thing I would want to know is what temperature should the vinegar be.
To replicate this experiment I would also need to know, in step two how much vinegar to pour into each containers. Otherwise you would not accurately be able to conduct this experiment.
After reading the group's procedure, in and for me to replicate this experiment, I would find need to know how much vinegar to be poured n each container, the size of each container and how long each sample is to be washed for. Me knowing these three additional sources of information I could successfully replicate this experiment.
To replicate the experiment you may want to know what the mass is when you take the sample out of the containers incase the water has an effect on it. Also you can try doing the experiement for a shorter or longer amount of time to get better results. Last you can let the samples dry longer to see what happens to them.
You would need to know what the four different samples are. Also you need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers. Lastly, you need to know what temperature to store them at.
"The group's procedure was pretty vague, there were no numeric values such as how much vinegar, and how large the samples are. Also, each sample should be named in the procedure like ""Determine the mass of marble, limestone, wood and plastic samples"" should be stated in the procedure."
To repeat the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar to put into the containers, you  would used to know the purpose of the experiment and what the difference is mass says about the samples.
Just based off of the procedure, you would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container as it never a list then correct amount. You'd also need to know what in use as a container, as some may be too large or small to get an accurate result. You'd also need to know the starting mass of each sample, and what the samples are.
Well you would need samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water. Three pieces of information, limestone, plastic, marble.
After reading this groups procedure some additional information they would need to add to complete this experiment is first, they need to tell you correct measurements such as how much vinegar to pour. Also, they should tell you how to determine the mass of each sample because there are many possible was you could find the temperature or measure it etc. Both of these observations should be added to the produre in order to do the experiment.
Some additional information is needed to replicate this experiment. First of all, the students need to state exactly what four types of samples to use in the experiment (marble, limestone, wood and plastic). They also need to state in the procedure the amount of vinegar (and type of vinegar) that needs to be put in each cup. The procedure also needs to state exactly how many repeated trials with the remaining samples should be done and how many extra samples should be used for the repeated trials.
You would also need to know what kind of object you used for each material, for example plastic could
In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know some background information on how much acid rain across each sample. Another piece of information needed would be is how much vinegar was pour into the separate identical containers. A third piece of information needed in order to replicate this experiment is how the gram measurements were taken use they taken using a gram soak? All of these things are needed in order to be able to replicate this experiment.
Information I would need: ^p - what do they want to find out in other words, their implied aim. ^p - the amnt of vinegar. ^p - the amnt of sample.
To be able to redo this experiment the group of students should have told you more things. For example, do they want us to use the same materials? Of course they do, so that's one. Another is, what kind of containers do they want us using? We can use plastic or metal or another. Lastly, you would need to know how much distilled water that you need.
In order to deplicate this experiment, we would need to know how much vinegar the people used. If we don,t know and we use more or less, it could change the experiments outcome. Also , we would need to know all of the tools they used so that we could use the same ones. And finally, it would help if they measured the mass inbetween the 24 hours.
One additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar, in ml, is needed to pour into the containers. Every container needs the same amount of vinegar. The other additional information needed is the fact that the difference in mass has to be determined or else, you would miss the point. The third additional information needed is what to measure the samples with and what unit they need to be measured in. They all need the same unit and balance.
To repeat this expirement I would need to know what the four samples were and how wide the containers should  be.
In order to replicate the experiment we would need to know the size of the containers the amount of vinegar and the temperature of the vinegar without this information the experiment cannot be replicated.
What they missed was the samples that they were pouring, the vinegar on. They need to have every piece of information in the procedure. So other people can do this job.
In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar did they put in each sample so you can get the exact amount of ending mass, because if we put a different amount we're going to get a different result.
One thing you need to know is how much vinegar to put into each container. Also which tsamples are they using and also how much of the sample should u use.For example, the whole object, half the object. Also if they were making a table what information do u need to record.
Pour vinegar in each of four separate, but identical containers. ^p After 24 hours, remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water. ^p Placing a single sample of one material into one container and label. Repeat with remaining samples placing a hours remove the samples from placing a singl.
You would need: Starting mass, ending mass, and difference in mass in order to replicate the experiment.
To replicate this experiment you will need the same ingridients and procedures also the time. Also, do a graph showing the difference in weight. We need to add the same amount of vinegar in each one.
NSR
In order to replicate the experiment, i would need to pouring, i  sample into more than just one container, instead of rinsing each sample with distilled water, wait 48 hours instead of allowing the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes, let it dry for hour.
How to extract the materials from the vinegar. what conditions would the materials be drying. (ex sunny warm place or dark cold place. what conditions would the material be soaking in (Temp, light ext-- )
You would need to know how much vinegar to put into the cups, that way you would get more accurate results.
You would need to know how much vinegar to use, what size the containers should be and how many trials to conduct to replicate the experiment.
To replicate this experiment the following information is needed, the amount of vinger that is needed in this experiment should be given. In this experiment to much or to little virner may be used. There should as be multible trails because the different samples may or may not take any vinger in. And the labeling  may not be the right label. The experiment should tell what each container should be labeled with.
In order to replicate the experiment they would need to determin what the materials were, they would have to establish a control and they would have to give directions to find the difference in mass.
After reading the groups procedure, some information I would need to replicate this experiment would be the temperature of the distilled water. Also, I would need to know how much vinegar that the group put in each cup. Lastly, you would need to do multiple trials for reliability.
Some additional information I would need would include what objects to determine the mass of. Also to replicate this procedure I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container, seeing as the group doesn't give an exact amount. I would also need to know how much distilled water to rinse each sample with. Finally their procedure doesn't tell exactly how to determine the mass.
The procedure should include what the four different samples are. At this point it is to vague and needs to be specified. The procedure should indicate how much vinegar needs to be poured on in each containers. The procedure should also encourage repetition. Human and equipment errors as always possible. Therefore it should give the readers an notion for the retests if necessary. Finally, the procedure does not include a control. This doesn't give the readers anything to compare the results.
The information you would need in order to replicate the experiment the mass of four labels marble, limestone, wood, and plastic is to show how you got the mass of each. what material did you use to get this answer. What effects did it have on all material such as color and size.
1) I would need to know how much vinegar is being put into the sample. ^p 2) What are they trying to find out through pass is to amount. ^p 3) Was there a control group in this experiment.
You would need to know how big of cups to use. How much vinegar was put in each cup and how big of a sample to get.
Some additional information that i would need to know to replicate the experiment would be what are the different samples that are used, i would also need to know how much of the sample to weigh, so they are all equall. What type of container should the sample be put into? how should i determine the mass of the different samples? How much vinegar to pour into the samples?.
In order to replicate the experiment you would need the amount of vinegar you use, for amount of marble,limestone and wood ,water you could use and has to determine the mass of the material.
To exactls replicat this expirement you leashneed to know how much of each sample to test with. Also you would need to know how much vinegar to use in the different cups, lastly you would need to know how much distilled water to rinse the samples with.
"You need something like a scale to determine the mass. ""Determine the mass of four different samples"". You need to identify what that sample. You also need to identify the amount of vinegar needed."
Determine the mass of four samples of what? How much vinegar is needed in the containers? You would need a scale to measure the different containers. Are the different containers made of the same material?
You would need to know the amount of vinigar they added, what kind of containers, and how much or how big each object is.
In order to replicate this experiment, the student would need to include how much distilled water the sample should be rinsed with. As well as how they determined the mass of the samples. Lastly, they need to show us how much vinegar they poured into the containers.
There are many things missing from this procedure which make it hard to replicate the experiment. Some pieces of information they could add are the type of sample to use and the mass each sample should be. These would help because will not them you don't know which samples you are supposed to use and if they're not all the same across you could get invalid results. Also, they need to tell you how much vinegar to put in each cup or else, once again there is a risk of the data being invalid.
Some additional information you would need is how much vinegar to put in the four containers, the actually samples they use ( marble, limestone, wood, plastic), and how you would measure the mass of each sample.
The additional information that would be needed in order to replicate the experiment would be what is in each of the containers, how much vinegar is put in each of the containers, and how much of the sample is in each container. In the procedure, they don't say what was in each of the containers. They also didn't say how much vinegar that they put into the containers. Lastly, they didn't say how much of the sample was in the containers. They needed to add that information in order to replicate the experiment.
You would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container and also what was the starting mass and the ending time for the experiment.
I would need to know several things before replicating this job. First, I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. Also, I would need to know what I should do to determine the mass of the samples. Lastly, I would need to know how much distilled water to use and what identical containers I should use.
I would have to write down what causes acid rain and put chemicals make up acid rain and why isn't it poisoning to humans.
To replicate the experiment, the amount of vinegar put in the container would be needed so it would not vary the results inappropriately. Also, the amount of each sample needs to be added because a greater sample to vinegar ratio will change the mass of the experiment. Also, in the table we can see that the people measured the mass before the samples were put in the vinegar, but without the table we would not know to do it because the procedure did not state if this needs to be added between steps 2 and 3 so later on the difference can be found and the change seen.
In order to replicate the experiment I would first need to know the amount of vinegar that the samples were placed in. Secondly, I need to know on what I should place the samples on, to allow them to dry. Lastly, to replicate the experiment I need to know the control group and the type of container I should use. Also it would be necessary to know what I should weigh the samples on.
In order to repeat this experiment you would need to know what containers the samples were put in , how much vinegar to pour into the containers and where you should let the samples dry off.
In order to replicate the experiment, you would also need to know if the containers were covered to ensure that none of the vinegar evaporated. You would also need to know at what temperature the samples in the containers were being kept and that all four were identical. A third additional piece of information you would need to know is what the samples are and you would need to label them. In the procedure the samples' identities are not given.
Additional information they could have added is mass, the weight of vinegar poured into the samples. They also could have stated what kind of solid samples into categories. 1 more thing that could be changed is have more trials with diffent samples and repeat the process used. Also, they could have waited for more than 30 mins to let the distilled water dry oil out.
Additional information I would need to replicate this experiment is how much vinegar do I pour into each container? Also I would need to know the control of the experiment so I could see what changed and how. I also need to know what I should use to measure the mass. They only say nreeus the mass in their experiment, they never told me specifically what to measure it with.
More information would be needed to replicate the experiment. It needs to be explained what the samples are of. It should say how much vinegar to use. Also, it should be stated where to put the samples submerged in vinegar. There should be a control included within the experiment. Directions should be given to calculate the difference in mass.
Use the same material that is used for the experiment.
In order to replicate the experiment the procedure needs to be more specific. It would need to tell how much vinigar is used in the containers, have a longer drying time because the samples will not be fully dry after 30 minutes and say what the samples are weighed with. It is also important that safety procautions are told such as gloves or goggles.
I would need to know what the samples were.
In order to replicate the experiment, you will need to know how much of the samples to use, how much vinegar to use and how big the containers have to be.
Why they even did it is in the first place. And what am I wanting to replicate the experiment and also where would I get the supplies I needed. And if there's anything that i Shouldn't use in this experiment.
The additional information I would need to replicate this experiment is a watch, a measureing container, also some marbles, limestone, wood and plastic.
To repeat this experiment again, you would need to know the volume of vinegar you poured into the containers. The volume could each have to be equal to get the best results. Next, you would want to know the volume of the containers, so that you can assure that the next time you perform the experiment, you have the same results. Last, you would want to know the amount of distilled water you used, and the volume of the samples, so that you know that all the sample is submerged in vinegar.
In order to replicate this group's experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each
One extra piece of information that I would need to replicate the experiment is the wot that was used to measure mass. I would also need to know what the four different samples were. In addition, I would need to know the amount of vinegar that was used.
The additional information that should be included in this procedure is. How much vinegar goes in each sample. Where do the samples go to sit and dry at. Label the samples in the procedure too not just in the data.
In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know the group's hypothesis and whether it was retreat or incorrect. This will help one to eliminate their thinking if they were wrong or to confirm their hypothesis. I would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container, and whether all the containers contained an equal amount of vinegar. Lastly, I would need to see results from a controlled experiment, such as a rock with water and make sure it does not decay.
There are several pieces of information that I would need to replicate this experiment. Firstly, in step one, I would want to know specifically what the four different samples were. Secondly, in step two, I need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers. Thirdly, in step three, I would need to know how much of each material to put into each container. Having a specific mass for the sample would be helpful in keeping the experiment consistent. All three of these pieces of additional information would extremely helpful in replicating this experiment and avoiding possible source of error while replicating.
The three additional part of information necessary to replication of this experiment are as follows:
I would have to check the mass of four different samples. Put vinegar in each one of the separate containers. Put a sample of a marble in one container and label it then repeat with the limestone, wood and plastic. While waiting 24 hours. I would remove the samples from their container and rinse them with distilled water then allow the samples to dry for an half an hour.
In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers. You would also need to know what the materials are that you're putting into containers. You also might need to know the size of the identical containers and what kind of containers they are. All these things are essential to replicating this experiment.
Information I would need to replicate I mass 4 samples. Should I
Same additional into that would be needed is how much vinegar should be poured into each container. I would also like to know how much distilled water was used and finally there should be something show who this is determining in the whole procedure to doesn't talk about acid rain once.
In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know: ^p  1. How much vinegar to put in each container ^p  2. How much water to use when you rinse each sample use distilled water/ temperature of water as well ^p  3. What temperature to put the samples to sit at when drying. ^p  4. How big the containers are ^p  5. What environment is the experiment taking place in? Hot, warm, freezing, wet etc.
After reading the group's  procedure, the group should add a hypothesis, controll, and objective.
After reading the procedure to their experiment I would also need to know how much vinegar to use, what are we using to determine the mass of each samples from the containers with, and what are the fair samples suppose to be
The procedure should contain  what different samples are going to weighed.  It also should say how much vinegar should b be putin the different containers. Lastly the procedure should contain the information if the masses are going to be record do make a data table.
"The Procedure is very flowed because I can't even understand half of it, When they are talking about the ""four samples"". They need to clarify what the samples are. They also need to clearly give the distinction of the container, the samples, and where viniger is poured into. Lastly, they need to not write step 3 because the container, sample and label have no refereced and are just plain renthstig."
Any additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment is what are the four samples that's mass are being determined, where are the containers with the samples going to be kept for the 24 hours and how long the samples need to be rinsed with distilled water.
A couple more things I would write in this experiment would be to make a hypothesis. Also when you are putting the rocks to dry make sure all the rocks are in the same place so they all dry evenly. Lastly, I would also I would compare the weights of all the rocks and see which ones heaviest at the begining and the end.
They didn't mention how much vinegar to put in the containers. This could effect the mass of the object at the end. They should specify how much to use and how big the containers are plus mention what the material the containers are.
Pour vinegar in each of four peparate but identical, containers. After 24 hours, remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water. Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes.
To replicate this experiment you would need to know how to go about weighing the rock's masses, how much vinegar you're putting the rocks in . Finally you need to know how much of each sample you're putting in a container.
First, you would need to know the amount of vinegar they put into each cup. Second you will need to know the temperature of the room. Third, you will also need to know wether the scale used was electric or normal.
Additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment would include; what the sample materials I was using were, what kind of result am I looking for when receive my data and what is the problem that I am suppose to attempt to solve. It would also be helpful to know where these materials were placed, whether it be in the sun or in the dark. By knowing all of this information it might make the possibility of duplicating the experiment more possible.
One thing they could have that they don't is a control of this procedure.The next thing they could have changed that they could have said how to get or determine the mas of each of the building material.The final thing is that I think with starting and ending mass they should have multipletllals.
I would like to know what the experiment is for ? What are the measurements for all this, how much vinegar in each container ?
To make this experiment's procedure complete,three additional things are needed. First, the names of the four materials should be included in the procedure for identification. Second, the vinegar being poured into the containers should be measured into a specific amount and the same amount used for all containers. Finally, all of the starting masses for the samples should be equal to make results comparisons easier. These additional steps would make the procedure better.
Additional information you would need to replicate this experiment is how much vinger to put in each container. Do you have to fill it or only put it so it reaches the top of the different materials? Also other info would be, what size containers do you need for this experiment. Lastly does it matter the material of the container: glass, metal. Throw away containers.
To replicate the experiment I would need to know what the students goal was. I always label how much of an amount to put into a container. In their procedure its that the students did not do this.
I would needed to know what different samples to find the mass, how much starting mass I would need, and how to measure the ending mass. Without these three pieces of information, I would not be able to replicate the experiment exactly.
I would need to know if they were put into an incubator to dry or were dryed in a different way. Would also need to know the temperature of the area incubator they were put into to dry. Also I would need to know where I should place a sample. Lastly, I would need to know the type of vinegar used c for example white, apple material. Also I would need to know how top measure the mass.
To replicate this experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar you need to pour in each container. You will also need to know how you are determining the mass of the sample, and what the samples actually are of (what material).
The students need a list of material,also the students should write that we have to form a hypothesis.The students must also add that we have to form a conclusion at the end of the experiment.
To replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much of the four samples you should weigh. You would also need to know what four samples to use. Also, to do this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to use in each container.
In order to replicate the groups experiment, I would need some additional information.I would need to know what types of samples to use what kind of containers to use and how much vinegar to pour into each container.
The additional information you would need is to describe the four samples you are using because it doesn't say which samples to use in the procedure. You would also need to know to determine the difference in mass because the procedure only tells you to find the starting and ending mass. You would also need the samples to dry for more than 30 minutes to get better results because the original results didn't have a large difference in mass.
In step one they could tell you the 4 different samples so that you could know what they are in step three they should tell you the amount os material that you should place in each container. After step number six it should say record data and repeat if needed.
There is something missing. In the procedure it says to pour vinegar into the containers. What it fails to mention is how much vingar to pour into each container. Without this the experiment is impossible to replicate because the independent variable would be the amount of vinager added, but there is no mention of how much to add
I would need to know what to measure the weight in, how much vinegear to put in, and how long to rinse each sample with distilled water for.
While I would need to know how much to put in each container and were to put these items from, and the fact were this could be done at in or out doors. How to get the starters mass of each sample. Between the starters and ending of the investigation how many times do you check it.
If you wish to replicate the experiment they would have to show or tell how much of the vinegar is needed, does the samples need to rest on a tray or on a paper towel, and tell the size of each of the samples.
We would need to know 1) the four types of sample mentioned in  2)  would need to be classified.temperature of vinegar, 3) type of wood /plastic/etc they used,and 4) the amount of vinegar they poured into each container.
In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what kind of samples to use. One would also have to know how much vinegar is being put in each container. Also, the students should specify what kind of container they are using in order to most closely replicate this.
Step one really should go at the end. You need to state the amount of vinegar that goes into the containers. Tell us the names of the elements along with the amount being tested. Tell which sample to begin the experiment with and what to label it. I would need to know how to determine the mass of the samples and make a graph.
"In order to adequately replicate this experiment, one would need more specific samples for example, instead of ""wood"" it should be a specific type of wood, marble, limestone or plastic. The procedure should also be clearer concerning how to use the vinegar in relation to the samples condition to remove such samples from the vinegar after 24 hours."
You would need the independent varible that never changes. To replicate the experiment  would need to no exactly how much of the vinegar was poured into each of the four containers. Also how did the mass reacted to the substance.
One thing you would need to know to complete this experiment is know how much vinegar do you need to put in the vinegar. And lastly how long are you keeping these samples in vinegar for? Days, weeks,it never tells you this information, it would be much more accurate if we knew those following things.
First off, you would need more samples of the rocks to put in the rain. Also, to replicate the experiment you would need to new to state the next day try the experiment all over again. The person replicating it would also have to wait a whole other 24 hours. More water and vinegar would be needed too.
To replicate the experiment, the Students need to include more detail in their procedure. First, we need to know what are good samples to use for this experiment. The students tell us to pour vinegar into containers, however it is not clear how much vinegar to use, if the amounts of vinegar are different, the entire experiment will not be accurate. To improve the experiment, the students could have done more trials to get better observations.
I would need to know how
One thing they should include is how much vinegars they need in each cup so you can measure be the same in all the containers.
In order to replicate the experiment, I need to know how much vinegar did the group of students pour in the identical containers, I need to know how much vinegar the students pour because its really important because maybe the students pour less vinegar in one cup and pour more in the other.
Additional information I would need to replicate the experiment is to whether I should leave the samples in a dark or lighted area for the 24 hour time period. Also I would need to know if I should leave the samples at room temperature or a cooler area. I would also need to know how much vinegar 3 should use, it doesn't state it clearly.
You would need to know that the vinegar is the substance that is being used for the acid rain. You would also need to know what type of materials you need. Another piece of needed information is how much vinegar to pour into each container because the more vinegar added,the stronger it may become and therefore the vinegar would be able to eat away at the samples more. You would also need to know where the containers were placed for the 24 hours (whether they were placed at cool temperature, hot or cold.)
In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container, you would also need to know what samples of what material you must place in each container.You need to know the 4 different samples, what to do with the difference in masses, what do the difference in the mass's tell you?
This procedure of acid rain tells about the starting mass in grams.They gave foour different samples but they didn't include a explanation way they were putting acid rain on the samples.The purpose of this experiment is to show the starting mass, ending mass, and the difference in mass i grams and it was compared to the different samples.
First off they dont tell you how much vinegar to put into the containers, & also that they should have addedacontrol or just water to have samples to confound and do.
the first thing the procedure needs to specific measurements the second thing it needs to identify each material. And the third thing is they need a controlled.
To replicate the experiment you might need to know how much vinegar to put in the cups.
You would  need to have a control group in order to have the accurate masses of the samples. Also plase the same amount of vinegar  and water into each container, Allowing students to record the correct data.
The additional information I need is to know how vinegar to pour in each container, what kind of container am I supposed to know and also how to determine the mass of each object.
If I replicated this I would also need what I uses acid rain in measuring the  container masses and how the acid rain would effect
In order to replicate this group's experiment I would need to know how much vinegar they put in each container. Also, I would need to know what type of marble, limestone, wood, and plastic was used. Finally I would also need to know which type of vinegar was used in their experiment.
In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how big of a container to use (what it should be able to hold), how much vinegar to pour into each container ( how many ml ), what type of vinegar, what to weigh the samples on (bathroom scale or type of beam balance, maybe electronic?).
The procedure is lacking multiple aspects of a good procedure sheet first, it should include measurements. We need to know how muche vinegar to put with each sample, second, the procedure does not list what materials to put in the vinegar lastly the procedure does not list safely precautions such as wearing gaggles these are important while working with chemicals.
To replicate this experiment you need the materials used in the experiment also you would need to make sure you follow the directions, record your data.
In order to replicate this procedure, they should includ a set mass for each stone i.e 10g of each sample. They also shuld include the amount of vinegar to be poured in each cup and the third they should include the size of the container.
I would need to know how much of each material was used because it doesn't say in the procedure. I would also have to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. I would also have to know how much water or how long to rinse the samples with the distilled water.
In order to replicate the experiment, I would need (other than the procedure) what samples to use (what materials), how much vinegar goes into each container and what shape the samples should be in. These pieces of information are important because using too little or too much vinegar will give different results. Using any sample other than the ones listed will give different results due to some materials inability to be changed by acid rain. Finally, the shape is important because the surface area could differ making the vinegar more or less chaotic during 24 hours.
The group needs to include each specific in their conclusion. The amount of vinigar must also be specified as well as the amount of each sample being placed in each container. The group never stated the method being used in determining the final mass of each sample. The table provided suggests that the group measured the mass of each sample and the difference between the starting mass and the ending mass but it was never mentioned in their procedure.
You may want to tell in the experiment how much vinegar you are pouring in; Explain how you found the differences in mass, mass before you rinse with the distilled water.
In the procedure, the group should have included what samples they were going to use (marble, limestone, wood, plastic), the group should have also gave to exact amount of how much vinegar to use in each cup. It would also have been useful if the group would have in the first procedure to measure the mass of each sample separately.
The students could have included how be determined the mass of the four items. They would also need to include the amount of vinegar they added to each container. It is also important that they include how much or how long the rinsed each item under the distilled water.
You wouldn't need any information. They provide you with all the information you need. They tell the procedure and they give you the data and they make a chart.
Additional information you would also need is how much vinegar you put the samples in.This doesn't tell you if each sample was covered by vinrgar completely or if it was partially covered.The starting mass of limestone was 9.8g the ending mass was 9.4g that was a - 0.4g difference. The experiment doesn't tell you though how much of sample was covered by vinegar.This is very important to know in order to replicate this experiment.
What are the four samples? are what kind of materials you would need, are tgoing out a hypothesis.
To replicate the experiment I would need to know what four different samples to use to determine the mass, how much vinegar do I pour in each of the four samples and am I doing all four at the same time. So they are taking out in 24 hrs at the same time.
In order for me to replicate this groups experiment, I need to know what type of sample am I weighing. I need to know how much vinegar am I pouring in the containers. I also need to know what I am labeling on containers,and what das I use to remove samples from the containers.
Some additional information that you would need in order to replicate this experiment are how much vinegar to put into each container, the size of the material and what kind of container the samples and vinegar are being put into these 3 things would  make very  experiment as close as possible to the group's.
You would need several things in addition to replicate this experiment. One would be how much vinegar to pour into the container. Another would be if all the containers got the same amount of vinegar or do they differ. A third piece of information needed would be what samples to use. Also, if they should all start out with the same mass or not.
The additional information that is necessary is how much vinegar you need to put in the container. I also think you need to know how much of the sample you put in the container. Where do you let the samples sit for 24 hours ? Inside, outside, by a window ?
One piece of additional information needed in the procedure would be how much vinegar to pour in the container. Another piece of information would be how much distilled water is needed to rinse the samples. Also another piece of information missing would what are the four samples you would be testing.
In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each cup so each sample is equal. I would also need to know the location of where the containers should be put during the 24 hours (ex: shade/sun). Lastly, I would need to know what kind of container should be used; a plastic, a covered or a dark container etc.
In order to replicate the experiment, one would need to know what the sample was, a desirable range in which the mass could fall under and the amount of solution (vinegar) that should be applied for each sample (Having a large range and an equal amount of solution compromises the validity)
In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know what the 4 different materials are that I'd be testing. In addition, I would need to know the exact amount of vinegar that needs to be poured on each sample. Finally, I would need to know that I was finding the difference in the mass from start to finish for each of the samples. Otherwise, I would be missing my dependent variable!
To replicate the experiment you are need to divide the different substances add more vinegar to each containers add more distilled water having them sit for 24 hours for about 30 minutes mass them and see how they wash.
You need to know how much vinegar to pour in you place the containers will change alittle.
1. Have a determined size for the starting samples of rock. ^p 2. Determine an amount of vinegar. ^p 3. Determine what type of containers are being used.
You will need to know which rock had the most mass, which one had the least and which one was the same.
In order to replicate the experiment, the procedure needs to include how much vinegar is going to be poured in the containers, how much water you rinse the containers with, where it is being dried and how to measure the mass (grams, dounds,etc.)
"I would include the materials used or the ""samples"". Also they should include in the procedure the type of measuring they are doing, masing, and state how much vinegar to pour in each cup."
Additional information that you would need for this experiment would be how much vinegar to put in, how big the container should be, and if the material should be or shouldn't be fully submerged by the vinegar.
One piece of information is that you will need to know how much vinegar to pour into eaach container and you need to know what kind of vinegar you need for the experiment. You also need to know what you're supposed to do with the data after you have collected it to find the answer to your problem. It doesn't say in the procedure to analize the data or anything like that.
To replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each sample. I would also need to know what the control of the experiment was so I could compare results of the samples. Lastly I would need to know if the experiment was completed.
*Include the name of the samples in the procedure. ^p *Say how do students measure the mass. ^p *Ask students to obsecvate the data and drawn conclusion.
The procedure never states what the samples are.It  needs to add the four samples marbles,limestone,wood and plastic into the first step.The procedure needs to state in the first step that the starting mass i) being measured and in the 6th step that the ending mass is being measured.The procedure also needs to add a step to tell the experimenter to determine the difference in mass from the starting and ending masses
In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know what the students are looking for? Why each steps of the procedure is being done? Why those  four samples were chosen and if there should be more trials or repettions , in order to create more accurate data.
The additional information you will need to replicate this experiment is how much more of the needed samples you need, how much time you will need to go through with the procedure and what your starting mass needs to be.
After reading the groups procedure, there was additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment. First, they didn't state how much vinegar to pour into the containers which is a huge factor. Second, in order to make sure their experiment was valid, they could have done another trial and lastly, they should state the temperature this is all happening at because that could have an effect on the results.
In order to replicate this experiment you need to know how much vinegar you need to pour on the four different samples. The second thing you need to know is, what temperature the room is when you start the experiment.The last step is, write a group and write the conclusion of your experiment record.
In order to replicate this experiment, the group would need some additional information in their procedure. An example would be how this group determined the mass of the substance. They need specifics like how much vinegar they need in each container, or how big the sample is or what the sample is. It's very vague, so they should add more specific.
I would need to know what the purpose of me doing the experiment would be and what exactly was I trying to find in order to replicate the experiment.
To replicate this experiment some more information that could be used would be to say in the procedure what amount of vinegar to use for all 4 cups.This would make a huge impact on the experiment outcome .Also include the size of the containers to use and the unit to measure the mass of the samples. Say what sample to use in the experiment too.
To replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar was to be added to to the four separate containers. Even though the samples are listed in the chart, the group drew the name of the samples should be in the procedure.
"The  group failed to identify how much vinegar you should pour into each container, what to label the containers, or what ""materials"" to put in the containers.They also forgot to include safety procedures and did not tell you to measure the different in or masses to carry the smals."
After reading the groups procedure I think that in order to replicate these experiment I will need to know what type of container and about how much vinigar to put into the conlainer.
The additional information that this experiment needs are the amount of vinegar to pour in each containar and say exactly what four samples you are using. You need to have these thingsin an experiment because if you don't, then you wouldn t know what you are experimenting and what is making that change. you also need a control group.
To tell me what the samples are in the procedure. ^p How much vinegar to pour in the four containers. ^p Where and at what temperature are they putting them in.
The biggest problem is that there is no control which would make the experiment invalide. Another problem is that they didn't mention how much vinegar should be used. The group wasn't very specific, for example they didn't say what temp. the samples should be kept at. By not mentioning constants and leaving out the control their experiment would be invalid.
After you remove the containers, you rinse them & see what results you get in about so minutes.
You would need to know the conditions of the sample: ^p -You would need to know what type of plastic because their are so many different plastics. ^p -You would need to know what type of wood because their are so many different types. ^p -You would also want to know the acidic level of their particular vinegar.
To be able to replicate the expariment, you would need to know the 4 samples you are exparimenting with. Although the 4 samples are listed in the data shown below the procedure, it doesn't show the samples in the procedure and if I was to do the expariment without the other groups data, there is no way I could without knowing the samples.
I would need vinegar, 4 containers, labels, time (24hours) a sink, 30 minutes for them to dry and a tripple beam ballance scale.
A person trying to replicate this experiment would need to know what type of containers to put the samples in, how much vinegar should be added at the temperature that the containers should be kept under. All of these would be information a person trying to replicate the experiment would need to know.
In order to replicate the experiment the information that i would need is how much vinegar do i pour on each sample. Also i would need to know what type of vinegar to use and do i put the samples in a refreglatar or reave them at room temperature.
After reading the groups, I would need to know what materials to be used during this experiment. I would also need to know what kind of scale to use to determine the mass of the objects & also what kind of container to use.
I would need to know what was happening to the samples during that 24 hrs. 2 I would need to know why they chose the four samples that they did. 3. I would also need gloves and a mask to protect myself.
One idea they might need to use, is to say what four materials/sabstones are being used in your procedure. Also they should be sure to use a control in this experiment(missing). The group should also  used more than one trial to their experiment/lab.
You would need to know how much vinegar you pour in each container, so the results are accurate. You would need to know how big each sample was you would also need to know what temperature this experiment was done at.
In my experiment  I would include steps: ^p 1. Gathering materials. ^p 2. Observation of the substances. ^p 3. Making sure no particles were lost in the rinsing of water.
To repercat this experiment I would need to knew how vingnr, what is the controy and what are the samples.
The group will need
If I were to replicate this experiment ,I would need to know the following things that the students left out of their procedure: ^p 1.How big should the rock samples be? ^p should they be relatively the same size? ^p 2. How much vinegar should be poured into the containers? ^p 3.How long should the samples be rinsed with distilled water? ^p 4.Should the containers be made out of any specific material?
If I were to replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour, what temperature to keep the experiment anothe vinegar, and what temperature to keep the experiment drying.
I would need to know how much vinegar that was used in each of the four containers. I would need to know what the four containers contained, since they are the samples being used in the experiment. And what to use to determine the mass of them.
To replicate the experiments you will need all the samples and how you will need more acid rain.
In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know what types of samples you should you should be using, how much vinegar you should put in each container, and you would also need to know how to separate the samples from the vinegar or whether or not the vinegar would be included when finally weighing the end mass of the samples.
The person doing the experiment would need to know how much vingear was poured into the container; what type of container they used. (plastic, metal, glass, etc; whether or not the person would need gloves, tongs and other utensils. You will also need a three beam scale to measure your materials before and after.
In order to replicate this expirement, you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup. Different amounts of vinegar would add another variable to the expirement , compromising the results.
Additional information you would need to in order to replicate the experiment would be how much vinegar you poured, the pH level of th vinegar , and much of the sample was added into the vinegar.
To replicate the experiment, I would need the materials to replicate the procedure I would need to know how much vinegar to pour each of the containers .To replicate the experiment  would need to know where to place the containers with the vinegar and materials in it .
I would need to know what the samples were of, how much vinegar, what containers, what material & how much of that material.
I would need a measurement of how much vinegar went into each container. I also would need to know how many trials were their. In addition I would need to know what type of vinegar was used.
To replicate this experiment I would need to know how much acid rain is used in the four samples. I would also need to know the measurements of vinegar poored into each of the containers. And what tempeture are the samples kept at for constain amount of time and how long for each time period.
In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container. Also, you would need to how to determine mass. Not to mention, you would need to know in what temperature would need to leave the samples to dry.
After reading the group's procedure they would need these four samples they need need to put down what there procedure is about.
They could have told us the amount of vinigar used, what they used to make the distilled water, and the could have explained how to rinse the material. I we should sook it in the water for a fewseconds or just rinse them.
The group of students investigating acid rain are missing several pieces of vitel information som ther data quatative data is recorded such as starting mass sitting mass and difference in mass unserturetly only  one type of quatetive data is recorded the sample type eg in a get the container and vngr types are not this causes type as different types of vinegar have different levels of acid concentration the ^p cup brand plays a less significant role but when trying to replicate an experiment the material and procedure have to be as close to the original as possible.
To replicate the experiment, I would need to know the readly of vinegar used with each materials. I would also need to know what kind of plastic they used in the expensal, because there are many diffrent
These other pieces of information that I would need in order to replicate this experiment as are what do I obtain marble, limestone, wood and plastic. Since there as the of materials
In order to replicate the group's experiment, you would need to know some additional information to the procedure given. One of these pieces of information is how the group determined the mase of the samples. Was it with a triple balance scale? etc. Another piece of information explained is how long each sample was. Finally, in order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know the amount of vinegar used.
Additional information that I would need in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar to put in the different samples, what the constant variable is and how to determine the mass of each sample.
In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know what kind of containers to use, how much vinegar and
One would need to find out witch sample is bigger and see how much big it is than the rest of them. Try to find out witch one can be is acid rain and not loss any mass and tell them you think this had happened in an if the because sentence.
My first piece of information would be a bar graph then I would give specific directions on what I did. But I would make it clear so other people can easily do it to. Then I would write a conclusion why this prblly happened.
I would write what
In order to replicate this experiment, there is quite a few other pieces of info that they need. First, you need to know how vinegar you have to pour on each sample. Secondly you need to know how much of each sample you need. Finally, you need to know the mass of the cups so you don't mix up the sample weight. That's the information you need to replicate this expiriment.
It should say how much vinegar they use in each container, it should say in the procedure what the 4 samples are that they are using. Each sample of the material they were using should have the same starting mass and same amount of vinegar should be used in each.
To replicate the experiment you would need to add as the first step gather all materials. In step two they should tell the amount of vinegar that was used. Step six should be changed to, after allowing each sample to dry determine the mass.
You would need to know how much vinegar to put on each sample. Different amounts of vinegar would give different results. You'd also need to know what to determine the mass with and what materials were used.
I would need to know what kind of instrument they used in order to determine the mass, I would need to know what sample materials I'm using in the procedure and I would need to know how many trials I would need to do.
You will need a solution, results and a conclusion.
From this experiment, I would need to know how big each of the containers are, I would also like to know how much vinegar was placed in each container If I was to replicate this experiment. I would also need to know how long to rinse off the samples with distilled water after this has been removed from their containers.
To replicate this experiment I would have to know how much vinegar to poor. I would have to know whatknd of samples to use.
The additional information that they would need in order to replicate the experiment is a sample of one material into one container and label. Repeat with with remaining samples placing a single sample into a container. After 24 hours remove the samples and allow samples to sit and dry. The additional information that would be needed is the starting mass the ending and the difference.
You would need to add the type of solution the stones on goingin.
In order to replicate this experiment, the group's procedure should include more specific information. They should include the name of the substances that they are using for samples. They should also add an exact amount of the four samples and exactly how each container should be labled. This will make the procedure easier to follow. It would also help to know how much vinegar should be poured in the containers.
One additional piece of information that they did not add in the procedure was to determine the change in mass from before and after the experiment. Also, between steps 1 and 2, there needs to be a step to put the samples in the 4 seperate, but identical containers.
How much vinegar is needed in each dish. What is the sample material. And how do you determine the mass.
In order to replicate this experiment I would need the size the four containers are, what the students used to measure the mass and how they got the answer of what the mass is. And how much vinegar the students poured into each container.
After reading the group experiment I belive that they will need multipule trials, they also need a control. What type of container, how much vinager. Also what you would use to find the mass.
To replicate the experiment you would need to know a control the remocture to keep the containers at, and you need to know how much vinegar.
In order to replicate this experiment information would have to be added to the procedure. I would need to know how much vinegar was put to each of the containers so that I can make sure some of them gets the same amount. Also, I would need to know how to determine the mass of the four different samples (by using a balance, or scale, etc). Finally I would need to know if the containers were closed or not, because that environmental factor could change the results of an/my/their experiment.
In order to replicate this experiment, you would first need to know the exact measurement of vinegar they used. Second, they would need to tell us the order in which they placed each materialinto the vinegar. Lastly, to repllcate this experiment, you would need to know the amount of time that you rinse each material. So the all came out equal. You would need to know all of these steps because otherwise they could be venables alering the result of the experiment.
To replicate this I would need much more information as to sizes of samples. Also, there should be more specific size measurements of the containar. Lastly, they never say how much vinegar to use. ^p All of these are important to being able to replicate the experiment.
According to the data that the students recorded, the starting mass had higher levels  the ending had some other high and low levels and the difference on mass had some law numbers out an order to replicate the experience I would  never backround hypothesis graft, counclution, problem, materials I think that what i will need in order to replicate the experiment.
The three samples of information would need to replicate the experiment are measurements of the amount of vinegar, the materials you would need to use and purpose of the experiments.
The procedure is unclear. In order to effectively replicate this experiment. I would need to know what the four samples that are needed, were, i would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. It would help to know how  large each container was as well.^p1.vinegar amount. 2. types of sampling. 3. containers size.
The first piece of information need would be how much vinegar has to be used in the containers. How much distilled water has to be used to wash them and does the containers need to do the present exciddion
You have to make sure that you are very specific when writing a procedure. Some additionally needed information would be in step 1, what measurement are you having the mass in (g, kg). In step 2 you need to give a precise amount that you are putting in the containers. (for example 10ml). Another thing is in step 3, what are you labeling the cups saying you need to specify. Lastly, in step 6 you need to put a measurement of what mass is to be calculated in.
After reading the groups procedure, additional information Ii would need in order to replicate the experience is; 1) Choose 4 different samples to work with. 2) Instead of pouring vinegar onto the samples use another liquid form. 3) And finally, instead of letting the samples sit and dry for 30 min, you can have them sit and dry for longer or shorter than 30 min.
After reading the group's procedure, the additional information I would need in order to replicate the experiment is how I can determine the mass. The materials I am working with. How identical the containers have to be.
To be able to replicate this experiment you would need know how much vineger to put in each containers, what type of scale to use to determine the mass. Also the type of container needed.
To repeat this experiment, you would need a list of materials.
In step 2 of says to pour vinegar in each of four separate but identical containers.
Some additional information I would need is, I would need to know how much vinegar t put into the containers. I would also need to know what the samples are. To replicate the experiment I would need to know where to put the container weather it be in the same room temperature or anywhere else.
To replicate this, I need to know what samples I'm working with. It doesn't tell you how much vinegar to pour into each of the cups. If says after 24 hours remove samples from the containers, where do they go for 24 hours?
In order to replicate the experiment , it is nesserry to know what material will be used no samples. To the different samples were listed in the procedure, it would be betterunderstand. It would also be useful to state the purpose of the experiment which is to record vinegar's effect on the mass of the samples. It would also be necessary to say how much vinegar should be added in each container.
The additional information I would need is how to determine the mass of four different samples. It is well specified. Also I need to know how much vinegar to pour into different containers, then after the experiment is complete I would need to figure out how to determine the mass of the samples.
In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know the amount of vinegar put in to each identical container. The four different samples, mass of them, and where they were put is stated. But not how much vinegar was put into the containers.
To replicate the experiment you would need to find out exactly what samples were tested in this case. The samples are marble, limestone, wood and plastic. You would need to find out when the experiment was being conducted and whose you're testing.
I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container and what type of vinegar to use. Also, they do not state what the four different samples are in their procedure which could cause confusion.
In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know many details. First, I would need to know what samples I am using in order to find their mass. I also would need to know how large each material is. This way I can perform an accurate best because I would know how large the material was. Also, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the cups so that each material recieves the same amount. Last, I would need to know how to rinse each material so that they all recieve the same amount of water.
In order to replicate the experiment, the group's procedure would need to include what each of the 4 different samples were, determining how much vinegar would be used in each container and it should state  the conditions the sample would be in,for example the temp. of the room.
You would need to know how much vinegar to poor in each container you would also need to know how much sample exactly do you have to put in each container the last thing i would need to know is what to label the mass of the sample.
You would need to know the amount of vinegar needed, the type of container and the amount of time to rinse each sample with water.
The additional information you would needs wch one was the best marble, limestone,wood and plastic.
At the start of the procedure, we would need to know what four samples we were testing. Otherwise we may test materials not even associated with the experiment. We also need to know how much vinegar we should put in the containers. We finally would also need to know what kind of containers we would put the samples in, plastic, glass? We need to know this as well.
Additional information needed to replicate this experiment would be to give the samples and how much of the samples were used in the procedure. Also the amount of vinegar and the size of the container used should be given.
This experiment should include an explanation of why students were doing this experiment. They should tell us why the mass decrease and why the wood keep the same mass.
Three pieces of information needed in order to replicate the experiment is, 1. To know how much vinegar to use, 2. what is the control, if any and 3. Do you cover the samples over the 24 hr  period,or do you just leave them uncovered?
If this experiment was going to be repeated, a control  would need to be used. Instead of using vinegar, the materials would be placed in water. Also, the procedure does not clearly state how much vinegar is used on each material. The amounts should be equal to balance it out. Changing the amount of time the samples sit inside the containers could also change the results of the experiment.
Some additional information you would need is what samples there putting in. They need a a hypothesis showing what conclusion for the hypothesis.
To make this experiment more accurate and the no to replicate it, I would need to the near of the 4 different samples in seat 1. Ake what are its materials/containers can't in step 3. And finally I would need to know what to measure the samples with, what kind of units.
I would write down how much vinegar they put in these 4 different example of mass. They didn't keep track of the experiment.^p They also didn't repeted the experiment again and I think thats one of the most important thing that everybody should do.
I think they should also  put why are they doing it I mean, what is the main idea of it because just to say they are trying to determine the masses of four different samples like the temperature, volume, how  ro the samples in a determined place etc.
Addition infarmation you would need in order to replicate the experiment would include controls such as how much of amount of vinegar is needed, in step 2 you would also need a specific or a set amount of each sample to move the results have meaning information costly you would need to make trials in the experiment to make sure the results are valid.
In order to replicate the experiment the scientist needs to know the amount of vinegar to pour in, also wt kind of container, the label's title, and the device used to measure the mass.
How much do you pour in the containers.
They also should watch how all the samples change and take notes. See if any of them dry slower then others or faster and why might they. Then see how it changes during the day.
In order to replicate the experiment, you should measure the amount of vinegar added in each container. You should also measure the mass of each sample before adding them to the vinegar. Lastly, you should measure the amount of vinegar left after the material is taken out.
In order to replicate the experiment you also need to know what types of sample materials will be more, how much of  each sample material needed, and how much vinegar you should pour into each container. By having this information, the lab will be more accurate and correct.
The additional information that is preferably required is how many drops of vinegar (which may have represented acid rain with a P.H of 3.2:) was put into each sample since: ^p -There were different masses of the given samples eg. marble, 9.8g whereas wood 11.2g. ^p -The ending mass may or may not have decreased in a major difference depending on how much vinegar was instilled. ^p -The mass of the different samples should be the same acquired together with the same amount of vinegar use, just looking for the best sample that could resist acid
After reading this procedure, I have noticed that I would need to know the Ph of the vinegar. Also I would need to kno how much vinegar is needed. Lastly, it is important to know what kind of cups they are using because they could have a chemical that rubes off  on the samples making the results diffrent.
In order to replicate the experiment, they should say what temperature to keep the room at, they should also say exactly how much vinegar to put in each container because that would change the results. And also they should include a specific amount of how much of the sample to put in, because if one sample is bigger than another, that will also change the results.
In order to replicate the group's experiment i would need to know the samples being used, how much vinegar to use and also what to lable. Without this information it would be very difficult to replicate the experiment with just using their procedure because it is not specific enough and doesn't include all the information needed.
The students should state what the four different samples are, state how much vinigar should be used in each samples container. Also there should be safety procedures so that no one gets vinigar in their eye.
Three additional information that is needed to replicate the experiment are, how much vinegar is needed to be poured, how long do you rinse the containers for. What do you measure the mass in
In order to replicate this lab experiment you would need to know what the names of the four different samples are. You would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into the four containers, so there is an even amount in each container. Another thing you would need to know when replicating this experiment is what you are using to find the mass.
I would need to know what kind of samples to use, how much vinegar to put on the samples and how  to label the containers to replicate the experiment.
In order needs say the information.
Pour the same amount of vinegar on all four. After you determine the mass of all four samples find out the different of each from first time you did it.
After reading the group's procedure, in order to replicate the experiment they would first have to be more specific and tell what the samples had to be. That is the only thing they would need to do.
The students didnot start with saying what materials ar needed. They also didnt say what the four samples were. The students did specify on what kind of materials they were useing!
As you can see the students investigation went well. The materials they used were marble, limestone, wood and plastic. By look of the data you can see that the starting mass for all of them is 9,8-marble, 10,4-limestone, 11,2-wood, 2,2-plastic. Then the end mass read 9,4-marble, 9,1-limestone, 11,2-wood and 7,1-plastic. As you can see all of them exsape limestone decreased. As you can see the investigation took a lot of time to put together. So I believe as I have laid out for you that this investigation took a lot of time and they came out with wonderful results.
After reading the group's procedure I have determined they could add what 'four different samples' you are using during the experiment. The group should also be specific with the amount of vinegar that should be poured into each containers. The temperature at which the ''samples'' are to dry ifor 30 min should be regulated because if it is too hot or too cold the experiment could be ruined.
In order to replicate this experiment, the group would need to most importantly state what the experiment is for, name the materials used and a hypothesis for the experiment.
For the information you would need all three pieces to describe the additional information, which is starting mass, ending mass, and the difference in mass. The items are marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. Then write all the numbers down to replicate the experiment.
I will need to add the vinegar in each of four separate and 24. 24 hours, I remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water and after I determine the mass of each sample.
Additional information I would need to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar needed to pour into the containers, the size of the containers themselves, and how long I would rinse the samples with distilled water after the samples are removed from the vineger.
They should add how much vinegar to pour into the container, and how large the container must be as well. Another thing they might want to add is the concentration of vinegar that is poured in whether 100% or 50% or something alse to find mass you would also need to find volume.
"To replicate this experiment i will need to say that,""List what will be the material going inside the container"". ^p I will also have to add in water what will have to be four different samples.3 identify how much amount of vinegar will the container have because this will affect the of the materials."
You need to know how much vinegar to put in each container, what and of container to use and whether to react the samples or not.
The additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar that is needed in each container. And also the site of the container needed for this experiment.
They should say how much vinegar to pour into each individual container. They should also tell how much of the sample they need to pour into the labeled container. They need to tell the temperature at which the samples are kept at for 24 hours. Also the temperature at which the samples sit an dry for 30 minutes.
In order to replicate the experiment, i would need to know a saw things. i would need to know how much vinegar they used, what kind of containers and how big it is and what kind of vinegar was used.
How much vinegar do you use for each cup of samples. They should have said how much water to rinse each sample with; Also could you try different liquids.
Take an hypothesis of what masses they'll have, analyze your results and make a conclusion to the problem.
The additional information that I would need to replicate the experiment the amount of vinegar plced in each cup I would also need to know how much each cup weighs by itself. I would need to know how big each individed
The students left out some important information in the procedure, like how much vinegar should be put into the cups. If we were to replicate the experiment we would not have the students data table so how much of what samples do we need to conduct the experiment. Where should the samples dry, warm, cold, in the sun?
Packet in fat it don't make no sense.
To replicate the student experiment you would need too find out how much vinegar too use for the containers. You would also need to how big of containers to use and you need to have more than one teal for each of the sediments to use.
Some additional information would be to have a control test with vinegar but stilking with
In order to replicate this experiment I would need a hypothesis, the materials that are needed and the measurement of liquid I would need. I would do the experiment the same way so I would also need to know what kind of container to use. I would also need to know at what time the experiment started and ended.
In order to replicate the experiment from the procedure what the four samples are must be included.In step 2, the size of the container must be included.For step, the units being used used to be stated.
The additional info that you need is a control, how much vinegar you are adding and how much of the material is used.
The first thing that they are missing is the amount of vinegar. They didn't go into enough detail on what their experiment is about.
I would need to know how much of each material will be needed. Also, I will need to know how large or small the container will have to be for the end results to be identical. Lastly, I must know where the containers were placed, in the sun, shade, etc. or my results may vary.
Additional information that you would need are the amount of vinegar that you pour into the samples, the temperature which you take the experiment and the efficiency of experiment. ^p + Vinegar affects the mass of sample (when it go inside - absorb). ^p + Temperature affects evaporation. ^p + Efficiency; when doing experiments you must have this measure of some conditions.
In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the containers. That would ensure that the differences in mass of the rocks was because of the rocks, and not the amount of vinegar. Also, I may need to know what types of rocks to use in the procedure list.
The additional information I would add would  be to record the data at the end of the procedure. Find the average of the samples. To find the difference in the objects that were placed in the container.
I will need for them to write the independent variable and the dependent variable before any thing else. They could of put doing how much vinegar they put in all four different samples.
Numbe one, you need to know how much vinegar needs to go into the containers.
In the procedure, the group of students said to pour vinegar in each of four containers. However, the students failed to state how much vinegar should be added. By not doing so one could try the experiment as the procedure says to but may get different results because the amount of vinegar that he or she used may be different from the students' amount. Also, there needs to three trials of each of the samples and a clear explanation as to how the mass of the samples was found.
You would need to know how much wood, limestone, marble, and plastic you would need. Also how much vinegar to put in the container. How long do you rinse the samples under the distilled water? Those are the information that you would need to do this experiment.
The group should have told the reader how much vinegar to put in the container. In their procedure, they also should have
If you were going to replicate the experiment you would also need to know: ^p What the samples are ( so you could use them) ^p How much vinegar to put into the containers. ^p What materials you need to gather without the above information you couidn't properly replicate the experiment.
The procedure could be better  if they included  inthere experiment a control, if they labled each sample specifically with what process they are  using, whether it be, marble, limestone, wood or plastic. Last the procedure doesn't include a clear purpose, why are they doing this experiment ? Is it nessecary, what varaety do they receive from this.
To replicate that experiment you would need to know what the names are of what your weighting. The students also need to include how much vinegar to pour at each of the samples being tested. The final thing would be that the whole procedure needs to be more thorough and more organised with no missing steps or information.
The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is after you did the experiment find out the mass again,do everything you did already but start with the information you already have,then determine the mass you end up with,and the difference in the mass. That's how I would replicate the experiment.
To replicate the experiment, you would need to include a couple steps to the procedure in order to make it clear and valid. They should add a control to it to improve it with their results and to make it more clear include. Lastly, that you need to find the difference between the starting and ending mass.
Additional information that should've been added to the acid rain experiment is that there needed to be more samples becaus somthing could've went wrong during at least one of the trials. Bin they didnt just try a plain trial with other things to see if it effected the ending mass.
In order to replicate the experiment, the group's procedure should mention which samples to use. (marble, limestone, wood and plastic). It should also contain more detailed information such as the amount vinegar poured in each container, and the size of the samples needed for testing.
After you would rinse each sample, it would be best to check the temporter, how much vinegar where used and I would like to know specifcly how many acid you use in this experiment.
In order to replicate the experiment, we  would need to know : ^p (1) Which kind of samples to use. ^p (2)  How much vinegar to add to each sample. ^p (3) How much of each sample to use.
Limestone has the highest starting mass then come wood, marble, and plastic so this investigation is complete.
There are a few additional pieces of information that one would need in order to replicate the experiment. First of all, the procedure fails to mention what the sample materials are, so their names would have to be included in the first step. Additionally, the procedure also does not mention how much vinegar to pour in each container. In order to replicate the experiment, one would need to know how much vinegar to put in each of the containers. Finally, the last step states, to determine the mass of each sample, but does not give a unit of measurement. Therefore, it would need to include that the mass is to be measured in grams. With this additional information, one could now replicate the experiment.
"To replicate the group's experiment, more information is neccesary. The students should have included the material types instead of ""four different samples"" and should have included the measurements used such as amount of each sample, container size."
On the groups procedure some additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment would be is what sample and you start first what happens if nothings happens to the sample in 24 hours and how do you find the difference in mass.
They should include in their procedure what the four samples of material they were using, their predictions for what would occur with those four objects and it should tell the reader to find the difference between the new and old mass to find out if the idem was affected.
In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know which 4 samples to use. Then, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container, which is very important. Finally, I would need to know what to label each container. In order to reciprocate this experiment exactly. Adding on, I would need to know how much of each sample to use from the staff in order to represent this experiment accurately.
One piece of information that would be needed to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar in the container. What the four samples are.
Some additional information that you would need to add is the starting mass ending mass and difference in mass because in there procedure they also dont know the sought amount to pour vinegar in the container it just says pour vinegar. They should also say what the sample is.
How much vinegar they aded into each container and how long do you rise each sample for, also the temperature the writer would be, Where the samples would be like in room temperature or in cold /hot areas.
Some additional informetion that would be needed is for number 2, how much vineagar is needed, the size that the containers should be and also another peice of informetion needed is when and what information should be recorded.
Information needed to replicate this would be to know how much vinegar is needed in each container, what would we use to determine the mass of the samples and what size containers should be used.
1.You will need on hypothesis. ^p 2.You will need a independent variable. ^p 3.You will need a dependant variable.
After reading their procedure, I don't even know what they are trying to do. If it was my procedure, I would try and make it more clear so that the person reading it knows what going on. I would add how many times to measure the mass and when to or now as well.
In order to a successful introductions of the expiriment we would need to know what the different samples are. How much vinegar should  be pour  into the containers. And what equipment to be use to determine the mass of each sample.
After reading this group procedure, some information that I would need is replicated this experiment is how to find the mass of the sample, what is the control for this experiment and how much vinegar needs to be poured into these containers. Without this information it is experiment would not be considered valid. There would be no control samples the amount of vinegar may not be the same and there is no information is no information on finding the mass.
In order to replicate this experiment I would need to know what materials I needed, what kind of sample and how much of it.
I need the viger the area and the weight to know the mass.
Although the samples are shown in the table they are not expressed in the procedure. In addition the amount of vinegar should be explained as well. Most importantly is the need for a constant mass of the samples ie 10g. The results are skewed when wood which is 11grams is compared to 7grams of plastic. The procedure should regulate the sizes of the different samples.
Some additional information you would need in order to replicate the expirement is to say how many containers and what size, how many containers and what size, how much of the sample to put in the container.
In order to replicate this experiment, additional information is needed . First, the amount of vinegar would be needed. Also, the type of wood used would be needed because different woods have different densities. Finally, the temperatures of the room, where the solutions sat, needs to be known.
You would need to give information on what the experiment is about.
The first thing thing they did wrong was they didn't explain what their objective and investigation was about. Also they didn't compare any data and talk about the difference in the mass.  They got information, but it did not have any mention to it.
This is a clear investigation of the Acid rain , they clear show a good procedure on the sample and the starting mass and the ending mass and the differece in mass.
The procedure should include what type of measurement to measure the 4 samples in, which would he grams as shown in the data table. Also what to measure them with. It should specify the amount of vinegar which needs to be poured into the containers. And finally, the procedure should explain how to determine the masses of the samples  in step 6
In order to replicate the experiment, additional information is needed. You need to know how much vinegar to put in each container, in step 3, you need to know what material you are putting in each container. You also should know how long to rinse the samples and how much water to rinse them in (step 4).
After reading the group's procedure, I can see that additional information is needed to do the experiment. First, I would need to the materials needed for the lab. I would need to get these items in ahead of time, and have the right things like containers. I would also need to know what kind of rocks were used. If I was looking at a sheet or instructions  that contained  only the procedure, I would need to know what rocks were used. A third thing the procedure hasn't told us is the amount of vinegar. For this to be a valid experiment, we would need to use the same amount of vinegar.
They would need to state the four different samples that they are using. they also could have done different trials of the experiment, and they should put in the procedure to record the data that they got.
After reading the group procedure, the additional information needed is the name of the four different samples. The group does not say what they are, also one ober not but needs to know the site of each sample another pieces of information needed has much vinegar should be poured into each container. The group also needs to put into there procedure what measurement they should and call use to weight the mass of each sample.
Additional information that we would need in order to replicate the experiment would be to get 4 cups, weigh the 4 cups and then put labels in the four cups with vinegar.
In order to replicate this experiment additional iformation is needed. The samples ^p need to be listed. Also why those  samples were chosen needs  to be ^p added in order to replicate the experiment. Another thing that needs to be added is the reason why we are finding the difference in mass.
In order to replace this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container. I would also need to know what type of container. I would even like
To replicate the experiment, you would have to know how much vinegar to use in each container, you'd need to know what time you started so that you could remove the samples from the containers as soon as exactly 24hrs have passed and lastly you'd need to know what time you set the samples out to dry so they can dry for the full 30min.
I would need to know how much vinegar to be able to do this experiment.
Need an exeirimental desier staldhs the hypothics title and IV and ov.
In order to replicate the experiment, i would need to know the brand of vinegar,
The additional information I would need to replicate this experiment would be the amount of rock, vinegar and distilled water.These measurements would be a necessity because they are not given but will determine the outcome of the experiment. The amount of rock is what is being tested. The amount of vinegar is independent variable. The amount of distilled water determine how much vinegar is washed away.
The information i want is the measures how much did you put in each cup put the table in order from small or large.
In this Acid rain procedure, it says to add vinegar into each container, you to put how much vinegar to put in each and you need to lable the containers you need to also clear she what material are being investigated. Give a start and stop time put safety googles on.
"Some additional information I would include on the group's procedue would be to specify the types of ""samples"" from the first step. Also, to tell what material or size the four identical containers should be. The way the masses were measuredshould also be included, along with the type of vinegar used to mock acid rain. The place and room temperature that the samples were put to dry should of been written as well. Lastly, they should have marbled a control variable such as all the samples put in with water instead of vinegar."
this experiment ^p In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar put on the container, the size of the samples I'd need to know with what they measured the starting and ending mass of the samples, what kind of container do i have to use.
A good procedure would show a little more information such as,  how much vinegar you pour into each container. It should also tell the size, and or type of containers used in this experiment. Also for it to be more accurate they should have started by making sure each sample has equal mass so it is easier to determine the resaults.
Firstly, it is needed to be known how much vinegar should be pouredinto each of the four seperate containers.
In order to replicate the group's procedure I would need some more information. I would need to know what the samples were. I would need to know the PH vuel of the vinegar, and I would need to know if there was any control in the experiment.
The sample is marble, starting mass 9.8, ending mass 9.4 and difference in mass - 0.4. The limestone sample, starting mass 10.4, 9.1 ending mass, difference - 0.4.
In order to replicate their experiment you would need additional information. First, they need to specity what the
If I were to replicate this experiment by looking at the procedure I would need a little more information to make it accurate. First of all you would need to know what the different samples were (marble, limestone, wood and plastic). I would also need to know that I had to measure the mass in grams and I would also need to know how much vinegar I need to pour in each cup.
After reading the students experiment I would need to know what size containers, how much vinegar for each sample, the kind of sample, and the mass of the sample.
You would need to know what kinds of stones were used in order to get similar results. you also need to know how much vinegar was used for each sample. You should know how to distribute the vinegar on the sample.
To replicate the experiment, you will need to know how much vinegar they put in each single container, you will need the size of the single containers and you need to determine the same masses for the materials.
The additional information I would need is how many trials they're going to do. Also how much vinegar they have to por in each container. Another piece of information they should have added is the safety things you need,goggles,gloves etc.
Some additional information could be the amount of vinegar poured into the containers or they could state what they used to determine the mass of the samples. Also since there is multiple varieties of plastic.they could state what kind of plastic they used.
You would need the weight of the samples to see how much everything weighed.
The procedures needs to tell me how much vinegar I'll be pouring into the containers, also what kind of container I'll be using. When determining the mass the procedures should tells as what to use such as a triple beam balanced or no electronic soaks.
In order to perform the experiment the way the students did one thing you would need to know is how much vinegar to put in the container. Also what size container should be used. Another thing that should be known is what temperature should the samples kept at. Lastly what temperature should the water use to rinse off the samples be and how long should they be rinsed.
To replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to put into the container.
In order to replicate this experiment with only the procedure, one would need to know what the given materials are . One would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each cup. Without this information, the results would be inaccurate. In addition, one would need to know to measure the mass of each sample. This information would lead to the successful replication of this experiment.
I would  need to know the original size of each of the four different samples. It is important to have them all be the same size. I would also  need to how much vinegars to put in the containers. The third, piece of additional information I would need to know is how much much distilled water I should rinse off each sample with.
The aditional informatiou I would need to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar needs to be added to each identical containers, what kind of materials are being placed into the samples and know why the mass is being calculated.
To replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar you put into the containers. You would also need to know how much marble, limestone, wood and plastic are needed in each container. Last, you would want to know what temperature you would keep the container at either hot or cold.
Before weighing starting mass weigh each container alone then with the samples.
You have to minus the ending mass from the starting mass.
After reading the group procedure the additional information, the info i need is how much vinegar should i pour into the four different cups, how could i prove to make sure its right without more than one trail, what are they really trying to investigate, also what are they actual trying to determine.
The 3 pieces of information you would kneed to know in order to replicate the experiment is, you need to know how much vinegar you are going to pour in each container, how big in diameter the marble are and what is the mass before you put the marble in the vinegar.
In order to replicate experiment I would need to know exactly how much vinegar to pour in each container, how much of each sample to put in the container, and
If I was going to repeat this experimen I would need to Know 2 things about the vinegar I would need to know how much vinegar to put the samples in and what type of vinegar.What type of plastic would I need what temperature would I put the samples soak in.
After reading the group's procedure, additional information that is needed in order to replicate the experiment is:How much vinegar was used, how big the containers were and on what should the samples be placed on to dry (tinet paper towel in the sun.etc)
I believe that they should of put more information for example what happen when they were done with the experiment and what would happen if they didn't pour the right amount of vinegar that was needed.
Some additional information that they would need to include in order for someone to replicate their investigation, would be the amount of vinegar poured in each container, the size or amount of each sample needed & the type of containers to hold each sample in.
In this experiment you need to know the starting mass of all 4 samples and the ending mass of all of them. You may also need to know that they were soaked in vinegar for 24 hours. What would that do to the samples.
To replicate this you would a hypothesis. Also some other information would be amount of vinegar and amount of each sample. You would not be able to retest this experiment this information. One other thing you might need is a control for the experiment, something to compare the results with.
I would need to know the problem and what tools to use and if I have to use marble, limestone, wood and plastic and how much vineger to use I would also need to know is how big the container is.
To replicate the experiment I would need the data, the samples of the experiment and I would also need the equipment.
"To replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to add to each sample. Also, I would need to know how to mass the samples (""determine the mass"" is too vague sets no 4). Finally, I would need to know what type of containers to use (plastic cups? Styrofoam? covers? ^p Initial amount for each samples."
The first starting mass was for wood 11.2g ending mass 11.2g and difference in mass 0.0g. Second was limestone with starting mass 10.4g, ending mass 9.1g difference -1.3g. Third starting mass was marble 9.8g ending mass at 9.4g and difference in mass -0.4g. Last was plastic starting mass 7.2g ending mass 7.1g difference -0.1g.
The group would need to table the date, explain what they are trying to experiment and also write a good conclusion on what the  outcome of their experiment was. This will help the panature to make and sence as to what you are trying to find out and, day.
Some additional information how much vinegar do I pour into the cup. Wha sample materials are they useing. How do I find the mass of each sample that is the additional information that needs to be adde.
I would need the procedure, the samples, starting mass, ending mass and difference in mass.
Additional information I would need to know would have to be the amount of vinegar the students put into each container. I would also need to find out what type of vinegar was in use for this experiment.
After reading the group's procedure,some additional information I would need to replicate the experiment would be: ^p                               1) To know the amount of vinegar they used ^p                               2) To know what their control variable is and their independent variables are since  they didn't label that ^p                               3) To Know whether or not the mass of the materials was with the mass of the container, because that will effect the results and decrease validity.
Some additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar was poured into the separate containers, what kinda of containers or size of container. Was each sample poured in to. And finally why did the group of students ande with distilled water. Why couldn't they just leave it how it was.
One piece of information i would need is the amount of vinegar to pour into the containers. A second piece is to know samples of what the first step says 4 samples but can they be anything? Lastly, i need to know if it matters where i leave my experiment. I should know if it needs to be in hot or cold temperatures or if it needs sunlight and factors like that.
After reading the group's procedure I think that they should say in their chart how much vinegar they put in the identical containers. Also they should put in the chart the time difference or did they do it at the same time; and what kind of containers did they use ? Beaker, test tube, a regular container ?
To replicate this experiment, you would need to know, how much vinegar to use in the samples, two, how big the pieces of rocks are,if they are the same or not and think you would need to know more about the containers, do they need a lid to cover evaporation, how large are they. More specific information is need to replicate this experiment from the procedure student here.
3. place marble, limestone, wood and plastic into separate containers. ^p 4. Let them sit for 24 hours and remove them after and rinse them with distilled water. ^p 5. Allow the samples to dry for 30 minutes.
The additional information I would need would be how much vinegar to pour into each container also how long it rinse after the 24 hours, and a problem statement said also be necessary.
In this experiment, the group needs to add some extra information so other students can replicate this procedure. When it tells us to pour the vinegar in each of the containers, it doesn't tel me how much i should fill in them. Step 3 is unclear when it states to place a sample of one material into one container, it doesn't explain the sample. Also they need to tell whether they are measuring the samples.
First you would need to know the much vinegar to use in order to keep the experiment consistent. Next, you would need to know the size of the marble because different sizes might each erato faster. Also you would need to know the kind of wood because some wood might solve faster than other kinds.
When simulating acid rain in this experiment it would be important to include consistant measurements to the data and results are accurate.They should start with the same ammount of mass ea each sample.  so  the change is seen easier and each sample is affected equally. By the same wage, It is also important that the samples be submerged in the same amount of vinegar. B/C the labs goal is to nonce change based on acid rain, its important the experiment be as close and as repeated as possible.
In order to replicate the experiment there is some information that is needed. The size of the container needs to be determined. also, the procedure just says four different samples, it never says what there needs to be a number for how much vinegar needs to be poured into the containers. Finally it doesn't say how long the sample should be rinced for. If those things are included in the procedure then the experiment could be duplicated.
There is one piece of information on that you would need in order to replicate this experiment that they forgot. You need to know the amount of vinegar that needs to go into each cup. If you didnt know that the whole experiment wouldnt be correct. You should have the vinegar at a constant measurement.
First, you need to specify how much vinegar is used per container. Second, you need a control for comparison purposes. Third, you need to state the size of the containers.
In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to why they are preforming this experiment and what it is trying to prove. You would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into the containers to keep that a constant. Lastly, it would be important to know the amount of each sample to add to the vinegar so that the samples aren't different because that could vary your results.
The additional information that I would need to know how many of each individual sample I am fiding the mass for; ^p They didn't say how much marbles or limestone or wood or plastic they just said a sample.
Additional information needed to replicate the experiment would be how many m/s of vinegar would I pour into the four containers. Also, I would need to know what material to put in each container. I would also need to know the measurment.
In the students procedure, you would need to include the step for measuring out an exact amount of vinegar and adding that specific amount to the containers and they would need to include the amount of distilled water to rinse with in order to increase the validity. Also, they should specify what type of container to put each sample in, such as a test tube or a beaker. The students should specify what samples to use in step 1 as well, so that when replicated the same samples will be used.
"In order to replicate the experiment one would need additional info that the group left out of their procedure. The group needs to include the problem, a hypothesis of what they're testing, materials ""they need to"""" perform the experiment, and a conclusion that analyses their data and states wether their hypothesis was wrong or right. The group also needs to list the amount of each sample used so that can remain a constant not a variable changed."
How much vinegar you will need to put in the container, what is the control variable, what's the dependent  and independent variable.
What you would also need to know is why you would leave it in the container for 24 hours, and not any other time .How you got the mass for the four different sample and why you would let it sit out for 30 min.
In the experiment, they wood is the one that shaped the same and the limestone, the one that went down the most. If the experiment was for an hour it would double.
1) How much of each sample should i use to replicate the experiment. ^p 2) How much vinegar should i use when replicating the experiment. ^p 3) What should i use to determine the mass in my experiment.
To successfully replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container because the results might come out differently with different measurements of materials. I would also need to know the amount of each sample to place in the vinegar. The final piece of information I would need to know is how much distilled water I am allowed to use to wash the vinegar off of the samples.
To make a hypothesis. ^p After to make a conclution. ^p Determine if the investigation is good or bad.
To replicate this experiment, I need to know the exact volume of the vinegar at the begining, and the volume at the end of the experiment.
I would need to know what the four different samples of material I was massing were. I would need to know how much vinegar to add. I would need to be told to calculate the difference in mass once the ending mass was found. In the beginning the procedure should also say to gather all materials and safety equipment, (goggles, hat)
They need to tell how much vinegar they need in each container. They need to tell like where they will place the containers, if it has to be in warm place or room temperature. They have actually determine the mass.
To be able to do the same experiment exactly the way the group of students did I would need the amount of vinegar in each asp. I would also need to know the environment around the samples for example, the temperature they were left to sit in. Lastly, I would try to keep the starting masses about the same for each material and give the number in the procedure.
In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know what kind of sample material is needed, how much vineagar to put in each container, and how much of each sample is necessary to get the best results.
After reading the groups procedure I would need additional information in each to replicate this experiment. For example, I would need to know how big should the containers be to put the sample. Then, how much vinegar should be added to each container. Finally, I would need to know if all the four samples be put in the container at the same or will it affect the final results of the experiment.
To replicate this experiment I would need is know what type of sample I would need to measure the mass. Additionally I would need to know what kind of containers to put the samples in. Also I would need to know how to measure the mass of the sample before and after the experiment.
You would need to know first, the materials needed for the experiment. Then, if the materials are listed, it will be easier to use them later on in the procedure. Second, you will need to know how to measure the mass like with a triple beam balance. Also, you will need to know how to remove the samples from the container. Would it be necessary to  take it out it out with your hands or may be use a tissue or metal handler to remove samples.
What kind of containers?Big small? what are the samples? They don't tell us what they are they could be anything you don't know there rocks until you look at the data table.In this they say to place a sample of a material into a container and label. What sample? what material? What containers and what are we supposed to label? the sample or what is being put into?
In order to keep this experiment valid you would have to make sure when they are to over night that they should all be in the same exact conditions.
To replicate this experiment you would need the following information. You would need the amount of vinegar, the students used, you would need the type of samples they used and would also need the type of containers that were used. Also you would need the starting masses of each of the samples that the students used.
In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to use the size of the container the pH of the vinegar and the room temperature
a The group would have said how much vinegar to add to each sample. ^p b The size of each sample should also be stated because size difference would affect the results of this experiment. ^p c Would need to know what materials to gather.
I would need to know what are the samples, like the ones they put in their table at other ones. They don't state what the samples have to be .  They also don't say how much should the samples weigh. They also don't say how much vinegar should  be used.  Should it be the same amount or no because they allweigh different amounts.
After reading the groups procedure, I would need to know the most important part of the experiment, the samples I would use. In the procedure the group does not say that you need marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. Additional information I would need would be how much of each sample I would need because I may need a band or ocuple of ances and I would need to know how much vinegar to use for each sample.
This table is not so clear it only has the dependent variables. It's still missing the control group. The indepent variable is the change in mass. The purpose of this experiment was to see the different mass for four different samples.
The three additional information you would need for a complete procedure for acid rain would be telling what each sample was in order to do the project. And also how much vinegar to put inside each separate container and last was what temperature should you rise the samples in water after 24 hours process.
Well first thing they do was they determine the mass of the samples, they Vinegar on different samples and than they wash it with water.
The additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment is determining the mass of force different samples, make sure you let  it sit for a white and make sure pour pour vinegar in each of four separate but identical containers.
I would need to know how much vinegar was used. I would also need to know what conditions the container was left in when it was left for 24 hours. Lastly, I would need to know more specifics about the sample materials such as what type of wood or plastic was used.
Additional information that the group would need in their procedure is a hypothesis to get them started. A final statement at the end of the experiment to clarify whether or not their procedure was accurate. One important thing they need to mention in this procedure is, what four different materials we are using.
In order to replicate the experiment, the group needs to clarify a certain mass for all of the samples. Otherwise, the data can be affected without this constant. Also, it is important to include what samples are from since the data table clarifies that marble, limestone, wood and plastic are the specific materials used. This needs to be included in the procedure. Finally, the group needs to include a specific amount of vinegar paired into each cup so that variations in the amount of vinegar don't affect the validity of the experiment.
In order to replicate this experiment, one would need to know, first or all ,what each sample is. They would also need to know  how much vinegar to use on the materials.Lastly they would need to know how many samples of each material.The would need and the substance size.
Additional information that i would need in order to replicate this experiment would be, what the sample are, how much vinegar i am supposed to pour into the container and lastly, how do i determine the mass of each sample (In other words what type of measuring device do i use).
To replicate this experiment first off I have to know which sample is which. When recording the mass I will not know which belongings to the correct sample. Also it does not tell us in what metric unit we are measuring the samples with, so this needs to be clearer. Last of all, in order to replicate this experiment I need to know how much vinegar needs to be added into the containers, because different amounts of vinegar can change the results. Last of all in step 4 it tell us to remove the samples, but I do not know ways to remove those samples, in a seperat cup or container?
So additional information you would add in order to replicate the experiment would be what kind of containers
You would need the starting mass, ending mass, and difference in mass.
You would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. You would also need to know how much of the sample material you should put in the containers. In addition you need to know how you would remove the samples from the containers weather you can touch them or have to grab them with something else.
Additional information needed in order to replicate in experiment would be how much vinegar would be poured in the container. if you do too much it's or not put the same amount in each mass the experiment will be dried. Also naming the containers with each sample so you know what when you write down your data. Including record data would or additional information too because if it wasn't without a procedure someone might forget to write all the data down.
What is the independent variable and what the devendent variable also don't ^p forget about the control.
In order for or to replicate the experiment, the chart needs to show every pice of the experiment like what hapend when you put Vinegar on four separate pices but identical containers, on how you put one pice of of material in one container and label them the doing the with the remaining samples one pice of material in one container for all of it each. By showing all the data then you'll be able to replicate the experiment.
One thing you would need to know is how much vinegar in step 2, to pour into the containers. Another piece of information that would be helpful for this procedure is how much of each sample you need to put into the container in step 3. A last thing you need to know is how long do you rinse the sample off for, in step 4.
1. You need to know the amount of vinegar being added. ^p 2. You need a controle group. ^p 3. You need to know what your labeling each container.
In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how to find the mass of the samples, possibly using an electronic  balance. I would also need to know how big of a container to use. Sometimes, if you have a lot of vinegar, the results will be different. I would also need to know the purpose of the lab. Is it to see the effects vinegar has on each of the sambles?
I would need to determine the mass of four different samples. Also, place a sample of one material into one container and label and after 24 hours,remove the samples frim the containers. I would have to do the mass of grams for the samples.
Make sure to include at least three pieces of information. Samples have lost in for mation because, iget information. Sample allow the samples to fit and dry for 30 minutes. ^p  Because, determine the mass of each sample.
First, would want to know what materials i would be testing in the procedure, the students do not povide a clear explanation of what is being tested. Also, how do we move the samples without touching them with our fingers, they should specify if we need to use forces to move them or not. The acids on our fingers could affect the samples, they should also describe how to figure out the mass, the way they wrote the procedure makes it so that one would not know what device to use to figure their new mass.
To replicate the experiment you would need to know what kind of samples you could use, such as marble or plastic. You would also need to know how to determine the samples and to find the difference in mass at the end. Between the starting mass and the ending mass of each sample.
The additional information you would have to indicate this procedure and you need to know how much vinegar to put in the container, how big the containers are and how you determine the mass of each sample.
I think that they needed to u the time on the box using all the other sample and show how long it stand there threw are where experiment.
Some additional information that would need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar you need, the size of the containers used in the experiment. You would also need to know the temperature of which the experiment would be staying at in the 24 hour period.
Some additional information i would need to replicate this experiment is how big the containers where also how much vinegar I would need to put in each container. The last thing I would need to know is if i can use more than four samples.
To replicate the groups procedure, you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container. You would also need a control, which would be all the sample in water and you would need to know where to keep the samples and what environment they should be left in.
In this experiment you would need to know the purpose of this experiment in order to replicate it. The students chart shows the before and after results and the procedure is good, however, it does not state what the purpose is here. I think the purpose is to test permeability at the samples. You would also need to know what samples you could use.
After reading the group procedure i have vinegar multiple pieces of information in order to replicate its ^p experiment would need how much vinegar put in each cup how long as they would rock for the temperature of the water and what amount the condition they were around to dry in the.
In order to replicate  the acid rain experiment, we must know more than what the group has given us. For example, in step 2 the students don't tell us how much vinegar needs to be poured in each container. They also don't tell us what kind of container and if it matters what it is made out of. In step 1 & 6 the group tells us to determine new mass of the samples. They don't say what we use or how to find the mass of the samples. Another problem is that they don't tell us what the samples are until we see the data table, they should say it in the procedure.
In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar they used. Also, you would need to know what size and shape the samples are. Also you would need to know how to dry the samples which it doesn't state.
This procedure is not very specific in its description. For one it does not tell you how to find the mass of the four different samples. It does not indicate the amount of vinegar to put in the container or how much of the sample. It also does not indicate to find the difference in the new mass at the end which is the results that you are really looking for.
After ending this groups procedure,i have decided that the group needs to show how much vinegar is added to each container.They should also include a purpose and problem statement to clear up wh we are going to replicate their procedure.
In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know how much vinaggar they poured on the three samples, the size of the samples, and the size of the containers. We would have to know all those things if we wanted to do this lab exactly like they did.
In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to add to all of the containers. I would also need to know how much of each sample I would need to get before testing, lastly, I would need to know what the control of the lab is in order to be able to draw conclusions about my results.
"The group was not very specific in their procedures. In step 1, they say ""determine mass of four different samples."" Samples of what? They never say. They also say to let it sit for 24 hours, where should it sit? In the light or dark? If I were to follow the procedure the group wrote, I would probably not be able to control the variables in the same way that they did without guessing."
some additional information that would be need with this experiment is a hypothesis. This is because you should predict and guess the things you could be working with. You would also need a scale to tell you how much each sample range in grams.
We would need to know how much vinegar to use in each contaner, also what type of container shold be used and if we're usin pure vineger or if its a solution. Lastly it would be helpful to throw if the containers were left and at room temperature over the 24 hours.
I would frustred to know where is being tested another word the specif materials which we are taking samples of in addition i would need to know the type of vinegar being since different vinegar have different ph along with the amount of vinegar added to each container these three pieces of information are all reason to replicate the experiment.
Some additional information that we will need in order to replicate the experiment is the materials that are needed. The other two things that is needed is that the students should write how to use the material and also how to clean up and clear everything out after experiment is over.
To replicate this experiment you would need to know the exact amount of vinegar used in each container or else the results would be different. Also, you would need to know the temperature of both the vinegar and the water you used you rinse the samples in, and the outer temperature where you let them sit for 24 hours.
In order to replicate this experiment, there would have to be instruction on how to find the mass of ann object. The word sample should be more specific, so it's absolutely clear what should be placed in the containers. Lastly, there should be a clear amount given for how much vinegar to pour into each container.
After reading the groups procedure, I would need to know some additional information to replicate the experiment. First, I would need to know what type of material is being used. Another thing I would need to know is where to keep the material; in sunlight? in darkness outside? I would also need to know how much vinegar to add to each cup.
Are other information you might need to redo this lab is after what time did they messure the samples again? now much vinigar they used, and what progress the samples made inbetween.
In order to replicate the experiment you will need to know why are the students making this experiment? Why are they trying to get the mass of the elements listed in the table?
To replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar was put into each cup. You should also use the same mass as in the original experiment. And you would have to know how much water to use or might have to allow more time for it to dry.
After reading the group's procedure, the additional information  I would need in order to replicate the experiment is,the amount of times to do the experiment, how long to let the sample sit each cycle and I would need to know the amount of sample and vinegar that has to be in each container. Also I need to know the what the control in this experiment and they need to describe the independent and dependent variable more fluent so that way, you can know what your dealing with.
In order to replicate the experiment is to have more samples, time and containers. So you can use different sample different results of the mass in all objects.
In the procedure it should inclode the four samples being massed, without this knowlege the experiment would be hard to repeat they should also tell of the meathod they are using to mass the four samples, yet another thing that should be added to this procedure is what type of container to use in the experiment. These 3 changes to the procedure, will make the experiment easy for replicate.
Since the groups procedure is a little vogue, in order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know some additional information. First, you'd need to where to let the sample sit and dry, because that could make a difference. And you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container since that mass to be held constant. Finally, you'd need to know what are the 4 different samples to use. You know by looking in the data table, when they don't list items in the procedure.
After reading the groups procedure, additional information that would be needed to replicate the experiment would be the number of trials that this experiment has to be done in order for u to be in a more valid. Their would also need to put for how long the samples need to be rinsed because if one sample was rinsed longer than another it would affect the difference in mass at the end of the experiment. And most importantly they should be more specific in exactly what the objects are being soaked in this experiment for 24 hours or this experiment would be convincing to follow.
In order to replicate the groups procedure I would need to know how much vinegar was poured into the containers, how large the containers were and how thoroughly the containers should be rinsed. With these pieces of information I could more accuratly follow the procedure and hopefully get similar results.
In the information they talk about all the procedures that the students did on there experiment. The students listed  everything  but they didn't give us the time they started. So you will know when to start the 24 hours. So you can drain them and let them come out.
I think that if this group that did the acid rain. Investigation should of recorded the temp. of the vinegar and cleared it if it was the right amount , so they didn't tell the amount of vinegar and the staff that happened that happened after they let the samples sit and dry.
Four different samples ^p Pour vinegar in each ^p Place a sample of one material ^p After 24 hours, allow samples to sit out for 30 min ^p Determine the mass of each sample.
You would need what the outcome is after the 24 hours. Label what liquid you used for this lab.
You would need to know what samples you would need to use. How much vinegar to put in the container, say if there was any repeating the trial.
After reading the groops procedure, some information i would add is how much vinigar to put in the cup, i would also say that maibe they should have mention what the room temp should have been when they left it over night because this temp could change the results of the experiment and they really dont have a dependent or independent variable.
In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know first what question the students are trying to answer and what the purpose of the lab is. Then, I would need to know what the three samples are. I would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each container and how large a sample of each material to use. The amounts are not specified. Finally, it would be helpful to know if a control should be used and what it should be.
In order to replicate the acid rain experiment, you would need to know specifically what four samples are being tested, how much vinegar should be poured into each container and what kind of balance/scale should be used to determine the mass?
It is necesary to have a constent for each of the four different samples. The constent would be using water instead of vinegar in the containers with the the samples. Also the students did not state how much vinegar they put into each container.
After reading the groups procedure, there are some things that may need to be added to be able to replicate the expirement. In the procedure, the students would have to add what the four samples are that are being used to determine the mass. Also, the students used to write down how much vinegar to put into each of the four containers. Last but not the least, the students will have to add what size should all four containers be for the samples.
To replicate the experiment, you will need determine the mass of four diffrent samples. Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes, place a sample of one material into one container a label, repeat with remaing samples, placing a single sample into a single container.
The additional information I would need in order to replicate the experiment are to know what the four samples are, how much vinegar to pour in to the containers, why to rinse the samples out with distilled water, what letting the samples sit and dry for 30 minutes does, and what I will measure the samples in to find their mass?
The students in the group should have the starting mass be the same for the samples in order to give accurate results . Also to replicate it. I would have to know how much vinegar is being poured into each container. Last the amount of distilled water for each sample should be specified.
The information that the procedure is missing to be able to replicate the experiment is the size of the containers. The size of each sample and how much vinegar did they use. Without these missing information then you can not replicate the experiment.
Some additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment are the amount of vinegar put in each container. You need to know what the four different samples are and you need to know what unit to use when measuring the mass of the samples.
I would need a list of materials and know what type of equipment to do this experiment on. I would also need to know the problem to this experiment. I would also need to know how much vinegar to put in to the containers and what size pieces is use to do this experiment.
In my opinion, they should add more informations of, the temperature because different samples migh react differently in lower or higher temperature. They should do more than just one try with each sample, It should be at least 3 to get a better data, they should have measure mass much more often as well.
In order to replicate this, I would need to know what the 4 samples this are testing for, so you don't know what to test. Also, around how much of the samples do you need? 100g or 50g or 10g. Also, how much vinegar to pour into each container. They must should be specific. They could have also added what to measure in grams, kg, lo etc. They should have also told what type of area to keep the samples in, Light/dark,warm/cold.
"There are several pieces of additional information needed to replicate this experiment. First, we need to know how much vinegar to add, in order to keep the amount constant and get results like those given. What size and configuration should the containers be ? It says ""identical"", but does not specify anything else. Thirdly, how do we determine the mass of the samples ?"
Atleast three pieces of information I would need to replicate this experiment is (1) what safety equipment should I wear? (2) The exact way to extract the samples from their containers (3) what do I need to determine the mass of each sample?
First at step one they need to tell you how to determine the mass of four different samples and should also label the samples there. In step 2, you need to be told how much vinegar to pour. In step 5, it could be helpful if you were told where to let the samples dry. Then in step 6, once again you need to be told how you should measure the mass of the samples.
You would need to know the size of the samples and how much vinegar to use. The size of the containers would also be vital to replicate the experiment.
The additional information needed to replicate this experiment included the starting shape and size of the sample, how much vinegar is being poured into the container and last what is being used to determine the mass of the samples.
In order for me to replicate this experiment you would need to know some additional information. One piece of information you need to know is how much vinegar is poured in each container. You also need  to know what the conditions are made out of. The last piece of information you need to know in order to do this experiment is if there is a top on the container.
I dont think i would add any additional information, The procedure seems pretty straight forward and very informational.
To replicate the experiment, I would have to know the size of its containers I use. Also I would need to know how much vinegar they poured in. Lastly, what is the sample material thats a major part of the experiment.
In order to be able to recreate this experiment I would need to know what is in the cups. I am assuming that it was same type of acid, because the marble lost 4g, the limestone lost 1.3g and the plastic lost 1g. The acid in the cups would have eaten away at the materials, and different acids have different rates of corrosion, so I would need to know what acid acid and its pH in order to recreate this experiment
To replicate the experiment, a person would need to know how much vinegar is added to each sample. They would also need to know what containers they used. A person would also need to know if the containers were covered or not during the experiment.
This experiment would need alot more information for it to be repcated. It will need a control groups so they can compare it to the rest of the variables. Understanding that there needs to be a consistant amount of vinegar and starting material would help the outcome of the experiment. It is also important that the materials are the same shape and size, so they have the same surface to volume ratio.
Without the table, a lot wouldn't be known by looking just at the procedure. First, in order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know what four samples you would be taking the mass of. Second, you would also need to know how much vinegar you should pour into the containers. Lastly, in order to replicate the experiment, the person would need to know how much distilled water should be used to rinse the materials. It would also help if it was specified in the procedure, with what should the person be finding the mass of the materials (balance?). In what unit (grams?).
The procedure did not tell the reader that they would have to record their data. This is important to replicate the experiment because if you do the experiment without writing anything down, you can't see the results as well.You would also need to know how much vinegar to put in the containers and have it be the same amount for each sample. You might also want to include the difference between the starting ending mass in the data findings.
In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know the amount of vinegar that get poured into containers what type of containers have vinegar is in and now much distilled water to rinse each material rilin  without much details the experiment that I would conduct would mass likely give me different results that the groups of students.
The additional information that I would need in order to replicate the experiment would be what size do the containers have to be, how much vinegar to pour in the containers, how big do the samples have to be, what should the labels say on them, how much water do I use and how long do I rinse for, and how do I measure the mass ?
In order to replicate the experiment, the group of students need a control. In warm water is used as the substitute for vinegar. In the first step, the students need to identify the fast different samples that are going to used experiment on. Also, the procedure did not identify how much vinegar should be needed to pass on the samples.This additional information would make the experiment more valid as it will be will be easier to follow.
"The group of students didn't specify what ""samples"" they were referring to. Secondly, they didn't include how much vinegar to add to the containers in step 2 nor did they list the size and or volume of said containers. They didn't give instructions on how or what to label the containers in step 3, or how much distilled water one would need to rinse the sample with in step 4. All of these would need to be taken into consideration in order to replicate the experiment."
1. Determine the mass of four different samples. ^p 2. Instead of pouring vinegar, pour a different kind of liquid. ^p 3. Use three different kind of containers to see what happens. ^p 4. After 24 hours, remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water. ^p 5. Allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 min. ^p 6. Determine the mass of each sample.
To replicate this experiment you would need the four different samples used, materials used in this experiment and a start time and ending time.
In order to replicate this experiment I would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. The group now specified how much vinegar was used in their experiment.
If I was to replicate the experiment I would need to know how to get the mass of each sample material. I would also need to know how much vinegar you need and I need  to know the size of the cups they are using.
To replicate this experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar you are using to put in the four cups, what measuring tool you are using to measure the mass of the samples, and what yourdetermining the mass of. In their procedure, it doesn't say how much vinegar they used nor the measureing tool they used. It also doesn't provide us with the answer of what they are actually getting the mass of.
After reading the groups procedure, a few things are missing. I would need to know the exact mass each sample should be before the experiment. By having all the mass's the same, it would be easier to determine the difference. I would also need to know the exact amount of vinegar each cup of samples would get. Also, some information such as how long I should rinse the samples for after the 24hours would be helpful in the replicn of this experiment.
If you wanted tor replicate the order then you would have to double everything in the mas trials that were provided for you.
How much vinegar to use. The temperature the experiment was conducted under. How much of such sample should be used.
Say the amount of vinegar put into each cup, how do you determine the mass ? And
How much vinegar do you pour in the four containers.
In this procedure, the group should also add information of the exact amount of vinegar used, the measurements of how much of the sample were put into each container, the temperature control of the area you put them in and lose what kind of containers they used. All this information is needed to replicate the experiment.
In order to replicate this experiment, you need to know how much vinegar to pour into the container and whether it's the same amount for each. In order for the experiment to be replicated, the students need to do 3 or more trials for each to gain reilabilly.You also need  have a control, which would be one of each placed in distilled water.The mass of each material should relatively close so that there isn't a drastic change in mass are to bigger placed or material.
How much liasis was used in each container,rinse with distilled water for how long .How much the container have to be.
One piece of additional information would be to give a specific amount of vinegar you would pour in rain container. Another would be to give the weight of each of the sample and make sure they are all the same. One more additional piece of information you could use is the size of the containers.
They need to specify what the four different sample are because it is the independant variable. They also neat to include how much vinegar is used because it is a controlled variable. Knowing the amount makes the experiment more accurate and more valid. Another thing is they don't mention a step in the procedure telling the person to measure the stones before they are placed on vinegar. This is needed for comparison. A control (one with just pure water) is needed to increase validity.
Additional information you wold need for this experiment is how much water was in each cup, you should also know if all the materials are close in size.
In these procedure it's not explained what this sample is that there putting in. So if we knew exactly what is was it would help. There should be a control with containers without vinegar to compare to the other samples with vinegar. The last thing to make the procedure right is to know the mass of each sample to know much to use.
After reading this procedure, the students could add the amount of vinegar, in number 2, that you would pour into the different containers. Another thing the students forgot was the different samples, what are they? They need to include marble, limestone, wood and plastic into the first step. The last thing they need to add is to include a step for finding the difference in the mass at the end.
In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know the ammount of vinegar in each container, I would need to know what it is they labelled on the container and I would also need to know the size of each container.
One would need to know maly things in order to replicate the group's procedure. We would need to know how much vinegar was poured in each container, how much sample to put in the containers and how big the containers are themselves.
First the students should have the amount of vinegar that goes into each container. Also the group should use a control in this experiment. To replicate this experiment we will also need to know under what coniditions the samples an the vinegar woll be in. We would noed to know whether or not it was in the sun or dark because that will make a difference.
In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to pour into they containers the group should also state were to let the samples stir and dry and how big of a container that the under should of seen and into.
We would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. It would also be helpful to know the size of the container & size of the sample to use. The process of how to clean the samples specifically as to not effect the mass is lacking information.
The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be how much of each sample would you need and how much vinegar howa you need in order to perform the experiment. Also, it would be helpful to know how you measure the mass of each sample like as what tools you may need.
In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much mass of each sample I would need. I would also need to know what I should use in order to calculate the masses. Another thing I would need to know is what material I am massing, they dont tell you any of that in the procedure. I also need to know how much vinegar to pour in each sample, because it seems here the vinegar is supposed to be the control of the experiment, but if the same amount isn't used each time then it won't be a control.
In order to replicate the groups experiments,I 'm going to need to know how much vinegar I need, and how large of containers I need.
Additional information that I would need to know in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar they soaked the samples in and how big the containers were that they used. And I would also need to know what shape the samples are.
The students can include the measurements of the vinegar that is poured into the cups. How much of the material they will to put into the containers. Use the same amount of mass for each object.
The additional information I would need to replicate this experiment is that new and how much vinegar in the container then also need to specify what material to put in the vinegar and how to determine the mass of each material.
For this experiment to be repllcated there would need to be a few added things such as what should be used used to measure the 4 different materials. Also what would those 4 materials be. It never states what materials to use. How much vinegar should be poured into cup? ^p Should it cover the material or not all the way the people performing have no idea about these things. There also needs to be a control maybe one untouched or put into water.
After reading the procedure, additional information that you would need to replicate the experiment would be; to know how much vinegar they poured in the four containers. Explain how to determine the mass of each sample and state what kind of vinegar was used.
In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much Vinegar I am putting into the four containers.
1. One thing that could be added to the procceger is that you could try using another liquid, rather than viniger. 2. another thing that you could change is add two of each type so there would be 2 stone types, 2 plastics, and 2 woods. 3. instead of rinsing each sample after 24 hours you could messure the mass with the viniger and then rins it off and measure without the viniger.
The additional information you need in order to replicate the experiment would be the time the example was started,the difference in mass from all four samples and determining which sample had more mass,which sample had the least. An explanation of why the amount of mass was that amount
-Repeat step 1-6 ^p -Round this data for the 2nd trial ^p -Compare the 2 trials and find the average mass for the four samples. ^p -Observe the data and make a conclusion on the experiment.
Additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment would be in the procedure, write you need to make a data table to record information, form a hypothesis and you would need a control.
1. What are the four different samples? ^p 2. How much vinegar are you supposed to pour into each sample? ^p 3. How are you going to measure the mass?
To replicate the experiment you need to know how much vinegar to put in the containers, there needs to be a control, and you also need to know the shape of the objects because shape could have an effect on how much material gets dissolved.
*They have to do the hypothesis to test if that mass is good to the experiment. ^p *They have to measure the amount of vinegar. ^p *They have to know how much time they have to repeat with remaining samples.
In order to replicate the experiment, there is some information that wasn't involved that is needed. First, in the product it just said pour vinegar. It didn't say how much which is important. Another important factor that would be needed is in what temperature to let the samples sit and deap in, in steps, it justsaid let it dry for 30 minutes, to didn'nt sayat whattemperature. Finally, when step 4 says, mix with distilled water, it doesn't say what temperature the distilled water has, it just says distilled water. I would need to kwow at what temperature distilled water has to be.
I would first need to know what material the samples know and I would need to know how much vinegar. I would also need to know how big each sample should be. Also how big the container would be.
The information that I would need to replicate this experiment is the same type of samples they used. The other thing I would need so that the experiment could be valid is the time they started with, which is the starting mass. Last but not repeat all the steps they did in order to have o valid experiment.
You need to know the amount of vinegar that you have to pour in the four separate containers. You also need to know what size container you are putting the sample in. Also, you need to know what temperature you leave the samples to sit and dry at for 30 min.
One piece of information I would want to know is how big each piece of rock, plastics wood.
In order to replicate the experiment, you would need a control such as water to compare the results to: You will need to know how much vinegar to include in the cup. You also will need to have an equal mass for equal mass for all of the samples. That is the additional information you need.
1. What kind of samples ? ^p 2. How much vinegar ? ^p 3. What kind of container ?
In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much of each sample to use it is important to only vary the type of sample, rather than varying the initial mass too. I would also need to be able to  know how much vinegar to pour onto each sample. Too much or too little vinegar will change the mass differences drastically. Storing the samples, is another vital area in this experiment. The temperature and amount of light the samples are exposed to needs to be directly mentioned within this experiment.
The people doing the lab need to stay in the procedure what matterials to use first. Also, they need to describe how to do all of these steps better so they make more sense. Also, they need to put at the end to repeat the whole thing 3 more times with the other materials instead of putting that in the middle of the procedure.
First you need vinegar. You must put some in four containers then place a sample of one material into one container and label. Then after 24 hours rinse each sample with water. After that let them dry and determine the mass of each sample.
In order for me to replicate this experiment I would have to know how I would determine the mass of each samples. When do you pour the vinegar in the containers. And what does distilled water mean.
In order for me to replicate this experiment, I would need a mass scale, vinegar, containers, stickers for labeling.A watch or timer and paper for it to dry after rinsing it. I would also need samples of marble,limestones,wood and plastic.
The information you need in order to replicate this experiment is how much of each sample you are putting into the containers. Maybe you should also state what the containers you are using look like.
To replicate the experiment you would need several more pieces of information. Firstly the amount of vinegar added would need to be included to try and control additionals for every material. Secondly you would need to know where the containers would be left for 24 hours after pouring vinegar. Different environments could affect the date. Third, you would need to know what type of container to use for the whole experiment. Differences in volume in different containers would also affect the data.
In order to replicate the experiment, one piece of information i would need to know is what materials are needed for the experiment. i would  also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. The students should be more specific in giving the directions well. They never tell you how to find the mass of the samples or the temperature the vinegar should be becare sawing is in. They should make sure the directions are more clear and simple directions like gather materials and clean the area at the beginning end.
Write down the results that you come up with, record your data, weigh the samples so  you could determine what the mass is. These are the three things that i would include because in their procedure they never said to weigh the samples so people reading this would think that they would have to guess when it should be weighed. You would also need the total of all the samples.
How much vinegar should they put on each containers.
Additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is, in the procedure it needs to be more specific and staff what kinds of samples you are using ( marble, limestone, wood, plastic) Also, it needs to say how much vinegar to pour into each cup, and what kind of cup to use. Also, how long you should rinse each of the samples with the distilled water and lastly, be more specific on how to dry the samples, should you dry it with papertowel and then let it sit for 30 minutes, or just let it sit?
The groups procedure was missing the amount of vingar to put into each of the containers, how big each sample should be and what to weigh each sample on.
The additional information needed would be: the exact amount of vinegar that is poured into each cup. You would  also need to know a specific type of container to put the sample in. Lastly, you may need to know that the samples are marble, limestone, wood and plastic.
The additional information needed is the amount of vinegar put into the containers. They had only done the procedure once, to make it valid they had to do it 3 more times. They have to get the exact or the same containers to get a fair result. In the procedure it says (2) pour vinegar in each of 4 separate, but identical containers.
After reading this experiment there is a lot I'd need to know. How much vinegar are they adding to each container, they need a control group in this experiment to rounenst results. I would also need to know what sample goes in each container.
Make sure they start with the same mass.
After rending the groups procedure, there are some things that i would need or is additional information would be, what type of samples I use, the students tell use to figure out the mass of 4 samples, what kind something else i could know is the point to the experiment in the procedure. It doesn't tell me why to do these. A final piece of information  i can know is what object will be used to measure the mass, instead of determine the mass of four different samples-they can say, use a _ to measure.
If you were to replicate this experiment you would have to know how much vinegar to add to the containers. You would also have to know what  kind of environment you should leave them in and how to determine each mass.
Some information I would need to have during the procedure would be wither or not to have the same amount of samples not just their mass. Also I would need to know the amount of vinegar needed to pour into the containers. And finally where do I pour the samples when filter and after the containers ?
In order to replicate the experiment, you would need four samples. The sample materials should be marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. Also, you would need vinegar, to pour into the containers which hold the four different samples. Additionally, distilled water needs to be used to rinse the materials, four different containers to hold the samples, and a triple beam balance to measure the starting and ending mass of the samples.
I think that these braid made to for the
In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know what the the types of materials where. Also how much of each material would you need in order to be able to do the experiment, then it says you measure the mass of each substances. You would need to know if they found the mass in the cups or not. That could affect the out come if you don't know.
To replicate the experiment you would need to know how much of each sample they put in the containers. You would need to know how big the containers were. And finally, you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each of the containers.
They could have added all of it up and come up with a average and they could have come up with the mass for all of them.
To replicate this experiment, I would need to know what four different samples I am getting, and how to measure the mass. What containers do I put them in? How much vinegar do I put into the containers? Do just let the containers sit out in room temp for 24 hours? Do I cover the containers? How do you measure the ending mass of each sample?
To replicate the experiment , you would need to know what samples to test, how much vinegar to put in the containers, and the temperature in which the samples are kept for 24 hours.
In order to replicate group's expirament we would  need to know the amount of vinegar that we put into the containers and we would also need equal amount of each samples. We would also need to know for how long each material is rinsed and the volume of the container.
You would need vinegar in each but 4 separate test taab's label them with what they are then wait 4 awer's and see the mass change in the object's you put into the vinegar over night.
If I would replicate this experiment, I would add to the procedure that you need to weigh the samples before adding vinegar to them and determine the mass. I would also add that you need to calculate the difference between the masses. I would also add to the procedure that you need to add a certain amount of vinegar and should be the same for each sample.
You would need to know what kind of material was used, marble, limestone, wood and plastic. What would happen if the samples cud not dry within 30 minutes. If you could not let them sit longer or if it was crushal that they would only sit for 30 minutes. Lastly you would need to know how you determined the mass of the samples. What do you use to measure the samples and when?
First you would need to know the amount of vinegar that are to be put into each container. Also, you would need to know what type if container to use. Next the student should have put how he carried  the sample and how rinses it off exactly, in order to replicate it. Another thing that should have been included is the temperature of the water because it is possible that one temperature washes of the solution better than another.
Additional information needed is you would need to know is, what the mass from the camse containers when they were full. You need to know the four different samples. How many containers you need.
1. You would need an expiremental control having just vinegar. ^p 2. No more than one trial for each sample to have precision. ^p 3. You would need to label how much vinegar would be put in.
First additional information would be to measure the starting mass of each sample before step 3. Then after step 6, find the difference in mass of each sample. The step before step 1 should be to collect all the samples.
I would have to know how much of each sample I would need to put in the cup. As well as needing to know how much distilled water in needed after the 24 hours, also I would need to know where to place the containers after they need to sit for 24 hours. I would need to know all of this if I wanted to replicate the experiment.
Additional information that would be needed top replicate the experiment is the type of different samples. I would also need to tell us how much vineger to put into cups. If they do not spesify, then the results may come out completly different. They should also determine how to mass the materials and what measurement they would use.
After reading the group's procedure, I realised that the additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is the name of the four different samples, you need to know the samples are _ limestone, wood marbles + plastic or the person doing the experiment would not know what the samples are. You also need to know how much vinegar you pour in each container and the size of the containers used.
The first, most dmas piece of information missing from the procedure is the 4 types of samples you need in the expirement. You cannot replicate the expirement without knowing what samples to use. The next piece of information missing is how large the sample should be. You should not have to guess what or appropate size should be. Also, the procedure does not include the amount of vinegar needed to be poured into each container. The amount of vinegar needed is essential information. Also, the procedure does not include how or where the samples should be stored. For example, should they be left covered or not?
You need to add to number 4, it should say how much distilled water, for number 24 it should say how much vinegar.
Those pieces of information you need to replicate this experiment are from the samples in 24 hours. Pouring vinegar into four seperate but identical containers, and to allow the samples be dry, you also need to determine the mass of the samples first.
In order to replicate the experiment, three more pieces of information I would need to figure out are: how much water to rinse the samples with, where to place the containers during the 24 hours (under sunlight, in shade), and also what size the container is and what shape. One more piece of information we would need to know is, how many more trials to preform will all that new information I will be able to preform a more valid experiment.
In the procedures the group should have told wat the 4 different samples where, also could add a control for this experiment. They also should have determined and shown how much vinegar was being added.
In order to replicate the experiment, the students need to specify what types of samples are needed to be used to find the mass. The students also need to specify how much vinegar to pour in the container. Accurate results would require a set amount of vinegar. Another thing the students needed to include in order for someone to recreate the experiment is to include what to label the container. Step 3 was too vaugue and it would be better to say label what material is in the container. They also should add more trials for more accurate results.
What would need to replicate the experment is the mass of four diffrent samples, vingar, cotainers, and water.
This group's procedure was good but some additional things i would have added was the number of samples, i determine the mass of the different samples, i believe that they also should have added the amount of vinegar they were adding to the identical containers, they also should put how much of the sample to put into the containers.
"In order to replicate the experiment , a list of materials should be included, especially the dependent variables ( marble, limestone,wood, plastic). It is not sufficient to have the indepent inciable be listed in the data table. Each substance (marble,limestone wood and plastic) should replace the word""samples"" in step 1.The procedure should also include how much distilled water rinse with because washing with different amounts of water can create hidden variables,because some sample retain water better than others (Wood,retains water better than plastic). There is also no indication  when the experimentor should stop rinsing the samples. In addition the students did not mention that the mass should be determined using an electronic balance measuring in grams."
To replicate the experiment i need four different example, then i need to pour vinegar in each but identical containers, then i need to place a sample of one a material into one container and lable then take it out of the container after 34 h and dry for 30 minutes. Finally determine the mass of each Example.
You will need to repeat this information an over again to see how your score comes out to be and if your not satisfied then you can do it over again to see if it's right.
In the given procedure it would help replicate the experiment if is included in it a list of what materials were used this is important  to know as well as how much vinegar should to used to pour into each beaker. If we do not know this information then we may get wildly different results. Inably what was need to determine ble mass of the samples. Depending on the need a different method we possibly a different mass could be found. Also it may help to have the four samples start made at tha same mass so you don't get skewed results
The first thing is that the students needed to specify their samples in the procedure instead of just being general saying samples. They also need to tell you to find & record the starting mass of each sample. You'd also need to know how much vinegar to pour into the contairs. Finally, they need to say at what temperature they should sit (room temp).
After reading the groups procedure, there are some pieces of information that are not given, for example, the group does not say how much vinegar was poured in the containers. They don't state how they find the mass of each sample. Lastly, they don't give the names or amounts of each sample.
In order to replicate this experiment, i would needed to know the different types of samores. They should add that to the procedure.Another important piece of information i would need to know is the amount of vinegar you need to pour into the containers.Also,i would need to know what the control is. They don't have a control to show how the others were affected.
The three information missed in that lab is the measure of vinegar, size of the container and also the size of each sample because if one of those are diffrent it's easily affected the final result.
First I would describe the materials I am using because in their procedure they only told us their putting vinegar in them they didn't say what.
What type of marble, limestone, wood, and plastic did they used?
To replicate the experiment you need to be told the four samples the you testing. You also need to know how much vinegar you using, you may also need to know how much you
needed to replicate this experiment
You would need to indicate what types of materials are beeing used in the experiment. You would need to know how much vinegar is beeing used. You would need to know how long to rinse the samples for, as well as the amount of distilled water beeing used to rinse them.
I would need to know the size of the container and how much vinegar I put in container.
The information that you will need for the experiment is the results of the whole information following the dependent varable and indepennet varable.
Three aditional pieces of information that are needed to do this procedure are how do you determine the mass, how much vinegar do you need in each cup, and they should have written the four diffrent samples in the procedure.
In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know how much vinager to pour into the containers, tell what the different samples are in the directions, and to be sure about the answers, perform the experiment 2 or 3 times again.
Need to follow the procedure, also need to know them too.
To replicate the groups procedore I would need to know how to determine the mass of the different sampes such as what would I use. Another piece of information I would need to know is how much vingar should I poor into the the four identical containers, and the last thing I would need to know is what would I use to determine how much the mass is of each sample after sifting in vinegar.
You may also use a couple of samples incase you make a mistake while you are putting that one sample in that container. You never know you can mes up.
You would need to know if the vinegar was to cover the whole sample or not, as this would affect the amount of mass lost. You would need to know how long to rinse the sample in distilled water as it could effect your results and difference in mass. You would also might want to consider how big of a piece of sample to use.
In order for you to replicate this experiment you need to know how much of the material they put in each cup. How much water you need and the amount of vinegar.
After reading the procedures the additional things I need to know is what size containers, how much vinegar to put in the containers.
In order to replicate this experiment you need to know the mass for each sample if it's the same or not, you also need to know the amount of vinegar and the size of the containers. The given procedure doesn't tell the location so you need to know the location of the containers.
Three things that should be included in this procedure is first it doesn't say how much vinegar is needed. Second it doesn't state what are the samples like what rocks they are. It should state specifically that there should be limes tone or marble. A third additional information is needed is how many trials to do of this. A fourth additional is what would the mass be measured with. A fifth is that it should be stated whether or not  there is a control in the experiment.
Additional information you would need to repeat this experiment would be: what kind of samples are being placed in the vinegar. Also you would need to know how much vinegar is being placed into each container.
"In order for myself or another to accurately replicate this acid rain procedure line two would have to be edited from ""pour vinegar in each of the four, separate, but identical containers"" to pour (amount in ml) of vinegar in each. This extra step will help with the validity keeping the procedure a lot more accurate in order to help someone else or even them self replicate the experiment accurately."
In order to this experiment to be replicated, I would need to know how many or what size samples I should be weighing, how much vinegar needs to be poured, what to label each container, and how long I need to rinse each sample. Only if I know these specific details will I then be able to complete the experiment like the other group.
One thing they can improve their procedure by is stating what to measure the mass of the rock with. Most likely, they should use grams or miligrams. Also they should have a step for recording their data. Finally the should say that in step 3, all cups should have the same amount of vinigar. They should also add a control.
What we need is two determine the mass of the samples and the label and they reely need to rinse it more.
In this experiment you would need the amount of vinegar that you would pour into the containers. You would also have to have a specific amount that you would use to sample each material. This would allow one compare each sample effectively. In step 4, The procedure says to remove the sample. In order to replicate the experiment one would need more information on how to remove the sample from the containers.
In order to replicate this experiment there are 3 things that you would need to know. The first thing is, you need to know how much vinegar to put in the containers. The second thing that you would need to know is how much of each rock sample to use in this experiment. Lastly, in order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what to use to measure the dryed rocks.
What you would need nothing everything seems to be alright with the procedures.
Additional information you would need to replicate this experiment include the amount of each sample used; the materials used such as equipment to mass each sample and amount of containers needed. Also you would need to know the amount of vinagar poured on each sample.
Additional information that would be how much vinegar would you need to pour into the containers at the beginning of the procedure. Also what type of containers should you put the samples in? How big should they be. Another thing would have to be how big all of the samples need to be so the results come out right.
"If I was going to replicate this expirment,I would need to know what the ""samples"" are,how much vinegar I need to pour in the containers and if I should measure it before I start."
The information that I would need to order to replicate the experiment would be,what the purpose of the experiment is. They give me what to do but not what I'm looking for.
Some additional information this group would need would be a dependent variable. They would also need to tell how they rinsed the samples. How much vinegar was used. How much of the samples were used. It doesn't say how much was used in step 2 or 3.
The three thing's that I think the procedure could and should have had but didn't was the type of container to put the sample in, how much vinegar to pour in and what to determine the mass with. These things are important because if there are differet type's of container it might effect the results if one sample has more vinegar than another it will not be accurate and the mass can be done on many things.
In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar to put into each container. You also need to be more specific and use proper names of things instead of using the word ''sample''. Also, step 3 should be switched with step 2. In order to make sense you should label things before you pour staff into the containers and this will help in the replication of the experiment.
The procedure for the acid rain lab should include several pieces of information that were overlooked. First, there was no specification regarding the samples, the students did not include information as to the general category of materials tested. Let done specify which suitably materials were used: Marble , limestone, wood and plastic. They also failed to determine the temperature the sample were stared at, As well as' the concentration of the vinegar with important  measurements that can pontentially affect data.
I would need to know how much vinegar  they used. How big the materials were that they used what kind of containers they were using.
Step 1 should be to gather each materials. ^p You need to know what materials to use. ^p Step 7 should tell you how to do the graph.
One piece of additional information that I would need to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar that should be poured in each of the four containers. This is important because thew vinegar is what caused the samples to lose mass, so the amount of mass lost in each sample.If the amount of vinegar is inconsistent, then the data won't be valid. I would also need to know the amount of each sample needed and the mass of the container.
Find the difference in mass.
After reading the groups procedure, the additional information I would need is the amount of vinegar used, how to find the mass, and the room temperature, in order to replicate the experiment.
In order to replicate the experiment they would need an equation to work with, a table of ingredients and the conclusion.
To replicate this experiment, I will need to know the size of the containers in which I should pour the vinegar, the amount of vineger and the size of the 4 materials.
The starting mass, The ending mass, The difference in the mass, Label the samples.
The information that I would need to replicate this experiment is what material I am putting in the container. I need to kind the control group indipendant variable,dependant variable, control variable. Also what temperature they were in and what I am lableing the containers.
They should have told what they were using to weight the materials and they should of said how much vinegar to use.
To replicate the experiment I would need to know the substance used as the sample.I also would need to know the exact amount of vinegar to pour in each cup. The starting incas for the sample would need to be identical for all other samples being used in the experiment.
In order to replicate the experiment, I need to know how much vinegar I should put into the four seperate containers. I would also need to know what temperature. I should place the containers while they sit for 24 hours. I would need to know where I should place the containers too, for example, in light, in dark place, or have it exposed to sunlight.
I would need to know how much vinegar I was pouring into every cup. I would need to know what the samples were in the procedure. I would also need to know to record the data and take observations.
One piece of additional information that is needed is the amount of vinegar neccessary to pour in the containers. Also it should explain how to determine the mass of the samples. In order to replicate this I would need to know what samples they placed into the containers.
"To replicate this experiment I would need to know what type of measurement item I would need to ""determine the mass of each sample"". Also I need the names of the samples that I need to use, such as marble or wood. Lastly, I need from the procedure, a control because I need to be told what I am testing for."
In order to run this experiment I would need to know what samples are being tested. I would also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each solution. I would also need to know what size the container should be that I'm pouring the solutions into.
What are the four different samples? There is no control so how do you know what water is. How much vinegar do you need to put into the containers, how big does the sample need to be.
Some of the things i would like to know is what are the four identical containers, what are the sample, and what are they testing for exactly.
There are several pieces of information that needs to be added in order to replicate
The group would need a problem hypothesis and a conclusion of what happend in this experment these 3 things would make the experiment a whole lot better it would ready state what they are trying to figure out.
I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup. I would need to know how much distilled water I would need and how to determine the mass of each sample. Also, how big would the cups have to be?
The information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment are a control group. Also, what are the four different samples? Another additional information would be a graph to chaw what happened and a conclusion.
You would have to pour vinegar in each four seperate but identical containers. Let it sit for 24 hours, remove the samples from the container and rinse each sample with distilled water. And then allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 minutes.
I would need to know why wood did not change?Why limestone it bigger and why plastic is small number
In order to complete this experiment I would need to have
To replicate the experiment, you would need to add what samples you are using, like marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. You would also need to say how much vinegar to put into each container, and lastly, you need to say too also determine the difference between each mass.
Record mass of all different samples, record the starting mass of each sample, record the entry mass and the difference in mass.
"Place a sample of one material into one container and label, ""repeat with remaining samples"",meaning a sample into a sangle container."
This group of students did not include many important information that was needed in order to replicate this lab experiment. One additional information they could have added was the messures in which they determined the mass of the four different materials, did they use a scale of a halause. Another additional information was the amount of vinegar poured into the contain, these students did not specify how much vinegar to pour which can definately change the outcome of the experiment. Lastly, the students did not create a control from which they can compare their results with.
You would need to know how much vinegar was put in to each sample, find the size and shape of the container so the same amount of vinegar was actually covering the sample. You would need to know the shape or volume of sample because the surface are has to be the same so the same amount is affected by the vinegar.
In order to replicate this experiment I would need four of the different mass samples and also pour vinegar in each of the four separate, but identical containers and place a single sample into a single container for 24 hours and after that remove it and let it dry for 30 min and determine the mass of each sample.
The replicability isn't very good because there are rather vague directions one improvement would be to measure ad how many milliliters of vinegar would be poured into each container so the amount of vinegar can be a controlled  variable, like 100ml per container. Also, the procedure needs to state the temperature at which the containers at for 24 hours at, so the repelilicn can have the same temperature. Also, there should be a certain amount of time to rinse the samples with distilled water, such as 10 seconds each so the samples have been equally rinsed.
The experiment is and requires everyday materials. If I did this experiment, I would include the temperature of the vinegar and the measured amount of vinegar in each container.
In order to replicate the experiment  I  would need to know what  the four different samples were, the amount of vinegar to pour in each of the containers, and I would need to know  the problem statement. I would need to know these things because different amounts of chemicals can cause different reactions and because without them I wouldn't know what I was testing for.
Additional information I would need to know to know is how much vinegar I would need to put into each up. This information would make sure that I get the same results every time. Instead of putting too much or too little of the substance.
Some additional information you need in order to replicate the experiment is more information how much time and hold in order to determine the mass of each sample. Also instead of containers use glass bottles.
Clearly this group procedure is not clear. They ask you to determine the mass of four different samples. They did not state which samples. They also did not state what unit of mass to use when weighing the objects. Without that I cannot be sure if my data will be reliable.
You also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each separate container, what types of container to use, and how long to rinse the samples with distilled water in order to replicate the experiment.
To replicate this lab you would need the samples to be the same masses. Also the amount time you let the samples sit has to be the same, then you would have to remove the samples and completely clean them.
I would need to know the certain type of 4 samples I would need to use to complete the experiment. I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container so I would have unreasonable results. I would also need to know what type of containers to use in order to complete this experiment, whether it it is big, medium or small. It would also help to show the problem so I would understand what I am trying to investigate.
In order to replicate the experiment the student need to write in detail a hypothesis for the experiment list the materials and samples needed and write out a conclusien to what those results to the experiment are
In order to replicate the experiment I would need the marble, limestone, wood and plastic to be the same starting mass, That way I could tell, which one is mot effective with vinegar, easier.
Some additional information would be,1Telling at the start of the procedur what you are using as materials, 2 tell what the three samples are, and 3. describ how much vinegar goes into each container.
In order to duplicate this procedure we would need 3 more pieces of information. We would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. We also need to know what the samples are for the experiment. Third, we need to know that we are finding a difference in mass from start to finish.
In order to replicate the group's experiment I would have to know more information. For example, it says to put vinegar, but it doesn't say the measurement of how much would be needed. It would also have to say what type and what size container to put the vinegar in. Lastly, the procedure would also have to say what types of samples they would be placing inside the container with vinegar.
The additional information, I would add would be what was the starting before the whole process before the eu hours occurd.
The additonal information you would need to replicate this experiment would be how much of each sample and what kind. You would also need to know how they determined the mass. You would also need to know how much vinegar they used in each cup. It would also be helpful to know what kind of environment the samples would need to be in.
The pieces they forgot to include were, how much vinegar did they use to test each sample and also how much was each sample used in this investigation. Also they forgot to write how long you need to leave the vinegar in the containers was in the substances.
The additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment is 1) To gather all the materials. 2) Tell how much distilled water, how big each container was. ^p 3) Record data.
The additional information needed is the amount of vinegar in each sample, the amount of sample poured in each containers, and in the end of the experiment the procedure does not tell you to weigh the ending sample, without this information you cannot fulfill this lab to get the data recorded in the table.
To uptake this groups experiment I would need an additional information. I would need to know how much vinegar to add the containers, also I need to know how much of each sample to pour in the containers. And lastly I would need to know what to unlike on the containers.
"The first thing I would add to the experiment is that the vinegar should be measured the same amount for all 4. Also, the procedure should saw what the ""4 different samples"" are ( marble, limestone, wood,plastic). Also, after placing the samples into containers, I believe the containers should be placed in the same location temperature as the others."
Which material you are using for the experiment, also record their masses before the vineger and also when it's in the vinegar. You also might want to mass the cup filled with vinegar to see how much grams it had gained with the material.
The additional information you would need in order to replicate the expierence is the 4 samples. The starting mass the ending mass and the time. Also the difference in mass.
In order to make the group's experiment more replicate, the first thing that should be done is to include the they materials used as independent variable. Secondly, how much vinegar should be added to each sample? Thirdly, in order to both make the experiment more replicate and improve the validity, a control should be tested. In an experiment like this, the control could be either the ending materials left dry or they can be sorted in distilled H2O.
To replicate this procedure, you would need to know many things. For instance, you would need to know how  big the container migt contained each separate sample were, you would also need to know how much vinegar was placed in the containers. You would also need to know how many kmrs the group repeated the procedure to know if is was accurate.
After reading the groups procedure, to replicate this experiment I would need information such as the amount of vinegar used to  make  acid rain I would also need a control group as well as doing the experiment at least 2 more times to have more accurate conclusion.
The changes they could make are ^p 1)Have an exact amount of vinegar they use in each container. ^p 2)They should repete the experiment more then one time. ^p 3)And they should make sure they have the same size of each material.
You would need to write down in the procedure to record the starting mass and the ending mass. You would also need to record the time that the samples were being listed.Last is how would need to determine what kind of container the samples was being shown in.
First, you would need to gather all of your materials. That is important because you don't want to start an experiment and not have every thing ready. Second, you need measurements of how much vinegar or every experiment would be different. Lastly, you need to remind to make a control group to compare results.
You would need the the for sample rocks ,vinegar but what we don't know is how much vinegar fore the plastic containers, put the rocks in the containers in different and then tape and label what kind of rock, then pour vinegar , leave for 24 hours to dry to used which stone is better, after 24 hours time to longer  from the container, leave stons sitting for 30 min to dry so that they can be examined (but each or that you should measure the mass of rocks in amount of viner thats being put in,then after 24 hours measure mass and record all the data.)
In order to replicate the experiment you would need to have to add some steps. A few steps that were missing would be the amount of vinegar poured in each cup, how long to rinse the distilled water and also where to let these samples dry off at.
-Change the amount of havre. ^p -Leave the samples to sit and dry for more or less than 30 minutes. ^p -Pour vinegar in each of for separate, but different containers.
One thing you would need to know to replicate the experiment is what the temp of the vinegar was because that can affect your results. Another thing you wouldneed toknowis how much vinegar was put into each container because that could also change the results. The last thing you would need to know is what they weighed the objects on because if you use another type of scale it could change your results.
Some other information you  would need in order to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar you would put in each container, how big should the sample be in question 3, and how much water do you rinse it with in question4 , also  the students can describe or tell you what kind of containers to use like a dealer or a test tube.
The additional information that would be needed in order to replicate the experiment is the names of the different samples. The amount of vinegar that each container would need. And you would have to have labeled each container in order to know what samples where going into which container.
The group should include more information about what problem they are investigating, there is nothing whatsoever about the statement of what they are trying to figure out another thing needed to replicate the experiment would be the amount of marble, limestone, wood and plastic. The students need to say exactly how much of each of these substances they used. They would also need to specify the amount of vinegar that was poured into the containers so that there is and an exact, identical amount.
You would need at least  4 containners, some vine-gar and label stickers. Also you will might need is a watch to record your time of the mass.
These students should say what the sample's were that they used. For example they could say for step one that you obtained a marble, limestone, piece of wood and a piece of plastic. I would need the four sample's inorder to complete this task. Secondly I would need vinegar in four separate containers. Lastly I need distilled water for the sample's and I would need a weight measure to check the mass of all four or any samples.
Maybe put more mass in the wood and leve it in longer than 24 years and period in for 10 mins.
In order to duplicate this experiment, I would need to determine the starting mass, ending mass and difference in mass.
After reading the students procedure, i though that they needed to add some things in their graph. What about the 24 hours? Didn't they  say after 24 hours but did they do this experiment at school? Because if they did, then they can't stay in school for 24 hours a day. How about the containers? Lastly, negative numbers? In mass, I never knew that you can have negative grams.
Well they all got diffient number of there project cause of the marbal got 9.8 limestone got 10.4 and wood 11.2 plastic 7.2 for the starting mass -5 project.
We would need to know how much vinegar the students used in the experiment. We would also need to know what kind of container they used. These two bits of information are important to know so that we can make sure that the replication samples were covered with vinegar the same as the original. We would also need to know the dimensions of the samples because a change in surface area would greatly alter the experiment (for if an object has a higher surface area to volume ratio, it will dissolve more quickly than a sample with a lower ratio). Lastly, we need to know the concentration of the vinegar.
In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know how much of the sample is put in,also how much vinegar to pour in. I would also need to know what  I am measuring the mass in,grams,etc. If I had the names of the samples then it would be easy to replicate the experiment. They also need say where to place the samples,a counter,in the sun,in the closet,they say nothing. Also the biggest of all what am I taking this for?
"The group's procedure is not very well done. In order to replicate their experiment the procedure would need more controlled variables. It says ""pour vinegar"" , there is no precise measurement this could lead to varied results. The procedure also lacks multiple trials. The experiment was only completed once. In order to be replicated multiple trials as well as controlled variables are needed."
In order to replicate the experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each cup used also need to know what mas are taking the aid how range are the sample that is a using.
I would need to know how much vine
The reason the procedure is bad because they did not finish.
After reading the group's procedure, you would need to know the problem in order to formulate a hypothesis, the materials so that you could directly replicate the procedure and the validity of the experiment so that you could repeat the experiment and conduct further trials in order to perhaps acheive more accurate results.
It is important to know how much vinegar to put in each container. It is also important to know how long to rinse them with distilled water or how much water should be used. The group should also write in their procedure whether or not they should cover the containers once they have the stone and vinegar in.
The procedure that is determine the mass of four different samples, pour vinegar in each of four separate, but idential containers. After of one day remove and allow the samples for 30 minutes.
To make the procedure correct, the group would have need to tell me how much of a sample i can use or should use. Also how much vinegar i should use and the size of the containers, without that information i could not replicate this experiment.
In order to appropiately replicate this experiment you would have to record and compare the results of the difference in mass in all four or if different substances. Also in this experiment, you would have to add to the procedure the temperature of which the substances will be present in making sure they are all the same. Also one piece that have to be added to this procedure is the amount of time the scteanst would take to rinse the objects with distilled water. Also in this experiment, it should be retained the total amount of vinegar that is placed into the identical cups and then should be removed after the substance is taken out.
You are going to need marble,limestone wood,plastic and vinegar.
You will need to do the same steps over. But you need to be safe with gougles, apnn, maybe gougles.
You need to know the amount of vinegars you poured. The size of the containers you are using. and all samples must be put in the same areas. Because the temperature and sunlight's does changes the result.
Some additional information I would need to repeat this experiment would be the amount of vinegar used in each cup, the how much distilled water to rinse with as well as the amount of time spent rinsing.
The first thing neccassary to replicate this experiment would be the amount of vinegar poured into each contain. The second thing neccasary would be how long we rinse of each sample with D water. The third thing we would have to know would be the volume of the containers.
In order to replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container. Also, I would need to know what samples I am using. I would need to know what size or shape of container to use. Finally, I would need to know exactly how each samples is to be put in and removed from the container.
In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how to determine the mass of the material, what the containers are made out of and on what material should we let the samples dry on.
After reading the groups procedure the additional information I would need is to determine the mass of each sample at the beginning. Also to determine the difference in the mass at the end of experiment.
I would need to know how to determine the mass. Specifically the size the materials containers were and any other controlled variables such as the type of vinegar or the temperature to ? the containers at for 24 hours as well as other storage conditions such as in direct sunlight.
The additional information I need in order to replicate the experiment is independent and the dependent variables. The materials needed to conduct the experiment. This experiment also needs trials.
One additional piece of information you would need to replicate the groups procedure would be the type of vinegar they were using, this is key reguarding the reactions of tha samples solidify and structure. Another piece of information I would need would be hoe much vinegar to pour in each cup. Lastly, I would need to know would be the temperature at which to start the samples while emerged in vinegar.
You would need to include how much vinegar to pair into each container, if you were labeling each sample after you washed it with distilled water, and what kind of samples they are.
What was the mass after 30 minutes. ^p What was the mass after 24 hours. ^p What was the influence between each time.
To replicate this experiment, i would have to know the problem and how much vinigar to pour into each container. How much water do you rinse them with and for how long?
In order to duplicate this experiment I would need a list of materials, what kind of samples and simpler steps.
To replicate this experiment, you would need to know what samples to use. It does not state what samples were used until the data table was shown.
The mass,use different mass. Different type of materials and different containers,
For the experiment you would need to know how much vinegar you would need to pour in each cup. For each sample I would need to no what kind of wood or plastic and how much of each sample should be used.
I'll make sure that when I'm going to end the mass,I will remember to not add a later any chemical or anything else to the ending mass,so it won't turn out to be a negetive or a zero as the disposure in the mass.
I want to know if the containers are the same size. Also how many times you have to do this experiment until its accurate.
The additional information you would need is the procedure.You would need the marble, limestone, wood and plastic, you also need the starting, ending and difference in mass.
Indicate what 4 miterials you are finding the mass of. How much vinigar must be poored into each container. Recording data along the way is important and not on the procedure.
First, the students should have specified what four samples to use in the first step. In step 3, the students should have told the reader that the samples were to be placed in the containers containing the vinegar. Also, it would have been a good idea to have included a step at the phd in which they would have to repeat the lab for accuracy.
In this procedure would need to be given the names of the samples and also in the procedure they missed some vital steps like gathering the materials and also cleaning up in the end
I would need ^p wood mass=starting 11.2 ending11.2 ^p marble mass=starting 9.8 ending 9.4 ^p plastic mass=starting 7.2 ending 7.1
"In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar would be added to each tube. The group also need to specify what the ""samples"" are. Also they never put a step in to weigh the marble before the experiment/procedure was over."
In order to replicate the experiment, we would need to know how much vinegar we add in each sample we testing, 5 lbs, 2 oz etc. Also, we need to know if the containers must be covered or left open. Also, what conditions should they be left in for the 24 hours ? Darkness ? Light ? Both ? This is what we must know to replicate this experiment.
To repeat the lab, the students are the information i would need is how much vinegar they used for each piece.
The three pieces of information needed is, which container kept the same mass when vinegar was poured? Which container lost less mass? Which container lost more mass? You could also need to pour more vinegar to each of four separate containers.
After reading the groups procedure there were many piece of information they could have added. One by showing how much vinegar was used in the test tube. Another reason is for step number three the group could of showed what they used as their control. The group did not mention a control. If there was a control it would have been all the same material but instead of vinegar the could ofused water. Lastly the group could have shown that they used two or more trials.
To recreate this experiment you would have to know how much vinegar would be poured into each of the containers. You would need to know what the samples are, how much of each are you would need. ^p  A.K.A :-Amount of vinegar ^p            -What kind of material the samples are made of ^p            -How much of each sample you'll add
Additional information that you would need to repeat this experiment would be one: how much vinegar is added to each separate container. Two, how much of each sample is added to each cup. Three, what you are measuring the weight in. Four, what temperature the samples be kept at for 24 hours.
The information you would need in order to replicate the experiment is, why would you need identical containers, material and vinegar.
In order to replicate the experiment you would need to
To replicate the experiment, you need to determine how much vinegar was used in each cup for this experiment. You also need to determine the tempature the did the experiment take place and how much of the material was used.
In the procedure more specific information is needed, such as the steps to determining the mass of each sample, how much vinegar should be poured in the four seperate containers and into what containers and with what do you label them with. With more specific information this would be a well written procedure.
"The students should include which is most resistant, least resistant, and how many drops of ""acid rain"" (vinegar) they put in."
I would need to know how to determine the mass of each sample. I'd need to know what to lable the containers. I'd need to know how to preform the steps, not just what the steps are of the experiment.
In this experiment, many things were not mentioned in the procedure that was crucial in order to replicate it, first was that the names of the sample were not given, so we don't know what to take the mass of. Second was that it didn't tell how much vinegar to pour into the container in the beginng of the procedure. Lastly, we would need to know where to put the sample containers for the 24-hour time period. Other than this, the experiment was written decently.
Before the students put the objects in the solution, they should have weighed each sample. The students also should have had a control for their experiment to truly tell if their data was correct. To make their experiment better, they should repeat the experiment more than once to see if their data matches.
The additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar that is poured in to the containers. How much of the sample material should be massed and should the same sample be used tofint in to the single container. Specify in the procedure what kind of sample materials to use.
"The 3 key materials that I need to replicate this experiment is ""vinegar"", a few plastic containers and a ""triple beam balance""."
If you want to replicate the experiment you would need to get a new starting mass, ending mass and a difference in mass. You will also need to find new rocks to experient to find different mass of each rock. You will also need new vinegar so they dont get mixed up with the other vinegar.
The additional information you need to replicate the experiment is how big I refer the containers. What temperature was the room at to make it dry. How many items of material were put into each container.
In order to replicate the experiment I need to know what the samples are, such as  wood or marble. I need to know how to find the mass of the samples such as by using a triple beam balance and I need to know how big the samples should be.
Some additional information that would be needed to replicate the Acid Rain experiment may include the exact amount of vinegar that is poured into the containers. Also you should know the room temperature and to make sure the room keeps in steady temperature throught the experiment. Lastly, in order to replicate this experiment I would need to know how much distilled water to use and how should I dry it.
I would need to know how much vinegar was poured into each container, I would need to know what temperature the samples were in and if that temperature remained constant for the 24 hours. I would also need to know how I would rinse each samples with distilled water without losing any sample, and I also need to know how many times I would need to rinse the sample in order to remove all of the vinegar.
They would need to include is a question of what they are trying to solve. Also they need to include what the four samples are in the procedure and how big they are. Another major thing they forgot to mention is what the climate of were the containers are sitting for the twenty four hours, are they all in the same spot as in dark or light. Thease are some key things that need to be included.
They should label the materials. Makes sure the scale is calibrated. Make sure you have a few days to do this lab
To replicate the experiment the amount of vinegar would need to be known to keep the experiment a constant. The containers that the materials are put into would also will have to be the same size to keep everything the same. The materials would have to be rinsed with the same distilled water and set to dry in the same temperature environment.
In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know which types of samples to begin with (marble,limestone,wood,plastic). You would also need to know exactly how much vinegar to pour in the containers for step 2, and lastly, what unit of measurement should the mass be recorded in?
Some additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar needed for step 2, what size  you need to make the samples key and what kind of container you need to put the samples in.
What temp is everything? they should include the temp and how mutch vinegar. Also repeat twice.
You need to know how much distilled water to rinse it with. You also need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. You need to know how bigof a container.
Additional information would include, what were the four different substances. How much vinegar was put into every cup. Also how much water was it rinse with it could also tell you figure out the difference.
We would need to know the time between the starting point and the end point.
The additional information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment, is the amount of vinegar that you need to pour in the containers, how much of the sample that you will use and what will you use to determine the mass of the sample.
To replicate this experiment I would need same additional information I would need the viner what type of container to use how long I should since we sample with distilled water for and water to determine the mass of the samples were and samples the experiment finished.
The most weak sample was limestone because  it lost 1.5g of mass. The other don't have much difference .The stranger samples in the Acid Rain is wood because didn't lost a gram.
In order to replicate the experiment, I would have to know the hypothesis of the experiment, because I am ensure of what i am testing for. Also, the problem to know what I am trying to prove, and the conclusion to see what resulted from the experiment, without these pieces of information included, it is difficult to realease the experiment because you were only given the procedure and not the full lab report.
One piece of additional information needed is how much vinegar you would put the samples in. Another would be how much of the samples? that is not specified. The last piece of additional information needed is how long do you rinse the samples for.
To replicate this procedure you would need to know a few more steps. First of all, they did not say how much vinegar you would need to pour in the container with the samples. Also, they must specify when you weigh the samples to get the starting weight that they recorded. Also, they did not say when to record the data you have and how you are getting the difference in mass.
You would need to pour vinegar in each of 4 seperate, size, identical containers. Place a sample of 1 material into a container and lable do the same with the other samples.
To order to reapit this experiment I need the number of mass, limestone,wood,plastic how much zone I have to doesn't tell us we need to reapit the steped we need  to know how long time we need to do the trials to know if the on same is right.
In order to replicate this experiment, you would need corr
Additional information that I need in order to replicate the experiment, is how much vinegar should be poured in the containers. And if it should be the same amount in all. More information needed is the amount time that the samples should be rinsed with distilled water. Lastly, information also needed is where to put the samples for the 24 hours. It doesn't say if the samples were put in different locations.
Measure the amount, after the 24 hours. Place the 4 different samples in 4 different places temperatures and leave samples in their area to dry.
When they are going through the procedure, they did not include the names of the tested items. They also didn't say what they were testing it for.
After reading the procedure there were 3 things missing. The three things were hour much vinegar did you put into each, container how much water do you use to rinse each object and how long do you rinse each object.
The mass of four different samples. ^p The time for them to sit. ^p The purpose of the experiment and wich sample. ^p Distilled water better.
In order to replicate this experiment, we would need to know how to determine the mass in steps 1 and 6, or what instrument to use. We would also need to know exactly what kind of identical containers they want to use in step 2. Finally, in step 5 we would have to know how and where to let the samples sit and dry.
You would need to know why you are pouring vineger into 4 masses. You need to pour the same amount of vineger into each sample. And also, you need to include 4 designated samples and say liquids or solids.
After I read the groups procedure, I determined that you need to know how much vinegar to pour in the contain in step 2. Another piece of information you need is what type of vinigar you need. The last piece of information you need is what size container should you use.
Additional information needed is how much vinegar to use on each material. Also, good additional information would be to tell where they left the containers with the materials.
1) In the procedure include the names of the materials that will be used during the investigation. ^p 2) How much vinegar should be in each cup? ^p 3) Include with what we should determine the mass of the samples.
How long the samples, how much the vinegar, at how big should containers be.
In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know were the samples were. Some may have been warmer then others and some may have been cooler. This may have been effected the experiment.
"The group stated to ""determine the mass of four different samples. Samples of what? They should have been more specific on what four samples they did the experiment on. They stated four Vinegar in each..."" They did not tell us how much Vinegar to use. Also the group did not use a control group to show the difference in mass without the control group."
What was their prediction before they start. After check if their prediction was right or not.
To reeplicate the procudure,the additional information i would need include:Which samples of materials were placed first to last and basically in counts of even seconds, which materials were processed longer into the vinegar filled containers.
I would add let all the samples sit in the vinegar to soak. Make sure they are dry before making on. Don't let any types get mixed up.
The group would need to include in their proceedures how much vinegar would be used, because that would impact the results. They should also include the size of the seperate identical containers, which could also impact result. The group could have also included information about the vinegar's temp, which is an important constant.
We need to know what the samples are in the procedure it just says to get four samples. It would also be helpful to tell us what unit to measure the samples and what size test tube to use. Then the lab would  be performed correctly.
You would need to know what materials to use, the amount of vinegar to use, and.
"In order to replicat the expirement, the procedure must tell us what materials they use for ""samples"", they must tell us how much vinegar they used in the four containers, they must tell us what to measure the mass of each sample in, and how long you rinse each sample in the distilled water."
Well Im not sure about this answer but if you want the same answer you repeat the steps in order to get the answer. But I think if they do the wood the viniguer will suck up-more because wood suck any liquid up. So it would have a different answer.
Additional information I would need in order to replicate the experiment would be the amount of vinegar you need to pour into the cups. What the samples you're using or and what your control group is going to be. There are important parts of the procedure that are missing.
I would have 4 container caled the 4s marble, limestar wood and plastic so the readers can know whats in the containers then poured a even amount of vinegar on each samee. Let it sit & dry out for 24 hours & deterime the mass I got at the end culd compared it to the mass I got in the begeing vig.
To replicate the experiment, one would need to know how much  vinegar was used.It would also be helpful to know what concentration of vinegar was used. To replicate the experiment, one must know what the samples were in the procedure and the containers they were put in.
I would need to know how to measure I samples. i would need to know how much vinegar o put in each cup should place it on in the shade.
Hypothesis to take a guess  wether the mass of four samples 1 of they was going to be right. ^p Independent  dependent variables in the students experiment ^p Results - The would didn't have any difference in mass and had the starting and ending mass were were the same 11.2
In order to replicate this experiment, we should be told the amount of vinegar in m/ls and tell what the container is made of and define if there needs to be a constant temperature in the 24 hours of it trying in an incubator.
To replicate the group experiment you would need to know what size container the group used to hold the samples. You would also need to know how long to rinse the samples. You would also  want to know how they dried the material, if you want to get the same data.
In order in replicate the experiment,you would need to know the amount of vinegar poured into the separate four identical containers, you would also need to know how the mass of the sample was examined(where type of scale) and should the sample the measure(what substance) are now indicated.All of the crucial elements stated a hour needed to marry out the experiment are not ntuing or missing not mention the lack of a control  to compare results to.
What the samples are, what type of containers.
Additional information that is needed to be able to replicate the experiment would be to know how much vinegar is being poured into the different yet identical containers.
Another important  piece of information we would need to know is how much vinegar would need to be put into each cup because if we poured more vinegar into one cup and a little into another cup the results may vary.
I would need the size of the containers. How or what the temperature of the water that they used to rinse the samples.
In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar used, how moch sample there was and what times the experiments were preformed at.
In order to replicate this experiment there are a few things that could be done. One would be to say how large each sample should be. It should also include what type of sample is being tested & another thing would be to include how much vinegar to use. Another good thing would be to have multiple trials.
You would would need to know how many trials to do for each sample, to make an effective experiment. You would need to know what to measure the mass in to it sound reasonable in the data. Also, you would need to pour in each of the four separate containers. All this information would help produce a successful experiment.
In order to replicate the experiment, you would first need to know how much vinegar to use. Also the amount of time its supposed to sit for. Most importantly, you would need to lable each container with the difference in each one.
You should obtain 4 seperate containers. And then mass the container so you can subtract the weight of the container when you mass the samples. This will give you just the mass of the samples, not the samples and container combined. The amount of vinegar to add to the samples should also be determined more clearly.
The group in this experiment can do
You would need vinegar, a sample material to put into a measurement and label them, also you would need four identical containers. This is to replicate the starting mass, ending mass and difference in mass. That is what you would need to replicate this experiment.
In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know the amount of vinegar that was poured into the containers. You would also need to know the conditions of the space where the samples were set to dry in, if there was more water vapor in the air and if the samples even dried completly, you would also need to know the density of each sample and if the sample was completly submerged or if it was floating on top.
After reading the group's procedure and making of the student's data recorded, I would say that they are mostly a few total information in some for one to replicate the experiment. One such information is how much vinegar in some they used on the samples, also what they used to determine the mass of the samples. Lastly what type of containers they used would also be useful information.
I would need to no how much vinegar you would put into each cup, how they determined the mass and how much of each sample did they use in each individual cups.
Starting mass, ending mass, change in mass.
The additional information we would need to replicate the experiment would be the conculsion.
Additional information I would need to repeat this experiment includes which four samples we are testing, how much vinegar to pour into the separate containers, how much of the a sample to put into the vinegar, what I would put the samples in after I remove them, and how I would determine the mass of each sample. These things are needed to replicate the experiment exactly or else I would not be able to know the directions and do the experiment the same.
Well first off you need to know how much vinegar to add to each container An how much of each  sample.  An what type of vinegar, I would be more specific.
Additional information that i would need in order to replicate this design is the four different samples. I would need to know the samples used to replicate this exeperiment. Also, I would need to know how much vinegar needs to be added to each stare, should it be submerged or not. Also, i would need to know does tempereture play a key factor, what is the temperature. Lastly, I would want to know the acidity of the acid(aka)vinegar.
You need to know how much vinegar to add to the containers. You need to know what kind of container and you also need to know how to measure the samples.
Make a data table to record each sample and the starting mass. Also record the ending mass, and the difference in mass. Also record the lowest and highest mass.
In order to repeat the experiment by looking at the procedure,one must know what the four samples are. The amount of vinegar for each sample should be known as well. Also,the person performing the procedure should know how much of each sample to take and what type of measurement to use when determining the mass (grarns).
With step number two how much vinegar should you pour? ^p With step number three what sample  goes with what container?
The additional information that we would need is, how much vinegar we need to pour on each of the four separate containers. Also, it says to label the container but what are we supposed to label. Lastly, it says to place a sample of one material but it doesn't say what kind of material and in the beginning, it says to determine the mass of four different samples but we don't know what kind samples . So they should say the names of it. There is a lot of information that is missing from this procedure.
Where do we keep the containers? How much vinegar will we use and lastly what type of wood and plastic will we use?
The additional information that the group did not add in,  was how much viniger was poured in each container. If each container had different mass of viniger, then it will affect the out come of the samples. You must have the same amount of viniger in each container and must be done at the right time to get the lab as accurate as possible.
One thing they would need to add is how much vinegar did the pour into the cups. Another thing that they should add is that the different cups should have long. They rinsed each sample with distilled water.
You would need to know how much vinegar was used in each container and how much of a sample to test in the experiment. Also if the mass of each sample is different, for example marble being 9.8 grams, plastic being 7.2 grams and wood being 11.2 grams, how is the mass of each determined?
In order to replicate this experiment you would need additional information. You would need to know materials,the 4 different samples are,how much vinegar was used,wether or not the material should be completely submerged in the vinegar. Without this information our data could be different.
Some additional information would be make sure the sample is dry to do anything else. Next, make sure you get all the data and make a chart.
To replicate this experiment project, you would need to know what type of containers were used to add the vinegar and how much vinegar to pour in each of the containers. Also, you would need to know how much each sample you need to place in the vinegar, how much distilled water you need to rinse it with and how well.
You would need to know what material the samples were made of. You would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each container. You would need to know how much of each sample to put into each container.
To replicate the experiment, I'd need to know how much Vineger to pour into each sample. I'd also need to know what to lable each sample and how much rain to put in each cup.
I would need to know how big the containers were, how much vinegar to use, and what amount of each of the 4 samples to replicate the experiment.
To repeat the students experiment you would need to know additionaly to the procedure
After reading the groups procedure, several things are needed in order for the experiment to be replicated. First, the four different samples should be identified and the desired mass should be specified. Also the amount of vinegar added to each sample should be identified.
"In order to replicate the experiment, you need the starting mass, the ending mass and the difference in mass. For example, the marble starting mass is ""9.8"" the ending mass is ""9.4"" and the difference in mass is ""0.4."" Now for the limestone, the data the group of students got was ""10.4"" for starting mass,""9.1"" ending mass, ""-1.3"" difference mass now for the wood students got ""11.2"". Starting mass ""11.2"" ending mass and 0.0 for difference mass."
How much vinegar to pour in, how much big are the containers, and which type of scale would i use?
In order to replicate this experiment, it should be useful to know how much mass of each sample you are trying to start with. Each starting mass the group used were different, having a significant effect on this results. You would also want to know how much vinegar the group is putting into each container. Also, it would be important to know how the group is covering the samples from the containers. Depending on how the samples are removed could play a major role on the final results.
For step two how much vinegar do you pour in? ^p For step four how do you remove the samples from the containers? ^p For step three what do you label the container?
Some additional information they could have added be how much vinegar should be pourred into each container, tell how much material they used in each container, and stated if there hypothesis was true.
1.)How much vinegar should go into each container ? ^p 2.)Why doesn't it matter which sample ? ^p 3.)Does it matter whether the the containers will affect your results ?
To replicate the experiment you would me to have the procedures, the materials and the time to do this project.
In order to replicate this experiment, a few pieces of additional information are needed. You wold need to know how much vinegar is being added to the containers. You would also need to know how much of one material is considered to be a sample. It is neccessary to know how to label the different containers since they are identical.
The additional information you would need inorder to replicate the experiment is tell how much vinegar to place into each containers, tell the size of each material such as the marble, limestone, wood acid wester.  The should also add wat the material would most likely look like after the experiment.
Three pieces of information you need in order to replicate the experiment is a hypothesis first to predict what you think will happen. Secondly, you need the data information like what they did in the table and third you need your tools which they obviously had since they already recorded their data.
In order for someone to replicate the experiment, this group should have immediately include, the names of the four samples substances. Also, they should include information about how much vinegar to add to each sample, and whether that amount remain constant for all 4 samples. This group also failed to inform us of the object of this experiment. When replicating this experiment it would not be clear to me the purpose of what i am doing and what i am trying to figure out.
In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar used in each cup. You would also have to include a control group without vinegar to see if the mass might change. Another piece of information needed is where the samples were placed, such as a hot environment or a cool one.
You will need to pour vinegar in four new separate, but idantical, containers. Then you will need to get four new samples. And determine the mass for four different samples.
For this experiment you would also need to know the equipment and the four samples.What were the samples and what else did you need to do the experiment also maybe a specific place to put the sample example light, dark rooms and temperature.Should you do the experiment twice one in light room,one dark different temp.How should the containers be placed?
To replicate this experiment, i would need to know what types of mative i used as so i would need a scope to wighe the motivel befor they get trement and after to make the steps easy they could have said repet steps 2 & 3 for each diffrent motivel used.
Some additional information  would need to  know is what  samples i'm useing which unit i'm measuring the mass in raw much vinegar i should put in each cup this is same information i would need put isn't to evident  in the procedure.
You need some pictures and a statement.
1 Let the samples sit to dry for different amount of time. ^p 2 Try different containers, not identical , different size/shapes. ^p 3 Try more than  one type of acid, besides vinegar. ^p 4 Let samples sit larger than 24 hours.
In order to replicate the groups experiment you would need to know how much vinegar to add each sample. Also you need to know what kind of container plastic, metal,paper this matter depending on how much vinegar would keep out of. Also the mass of the sample all need to be the same different mater make different conclusions due to surface area and such.
To replicate the group's experiment I would need to know how much vinegar and we would have to label the containers.
In order to replicate the experiment, the additional information you would need would be how much vinegar you should pour into the four separate containers in step 2. Another piece of additional information would be mentioning the specific samples being used in the procedure. A third piece of information would be how much water you should rinse each sample with after the 24 hours.
Well, you will need the same amount of objects to the other experiment, so it could be the same.
You would  have to see what is the amount of rain. Also , need all the measurements  of the vinegar.
"To replicate this groups exiperiment, I would need to know how much vinegar I should use, what samples to use (incase the graph wasn't shown, then I wouldn't know) and lastly I would need to know how to determine the mass. Since I am unaware of how to determine the mass. In the procedure it should say ""determine the mass by..."""
Some information you will need in order to replicate the experiment is things such as your hypothesis problem, results, conclusion, etc. You will also need to show how you got your results and conclusion.
Initially, in order to do this expirament one would need to know which individual samples to use and what kind of samples to use. The students should have included the amount of vinegar to pour into each container so the investigation would be consistant in order for the expirament to be accurately reproduced. The students  should have included the type and size of the container, the apparatis used to measure the mass of each sample and included a list of materials for future investigations
Additional information to replicate this experiment would be how much vinegar should be poured into the containers. Another would be how much distilled water should be used to  use the samples. The third would be by what method should the mass of the samples be determined.
After reading the groups procedure the additional information you need is the dependent and independent variable, central and costenit,hypothesis, and problem statement.
The group is missing a whole in 1 of important details. I would need to know how much vinegar to use for one
You would need to tell us how long it stayed out there.
How do you find the mass, whatdoyoumeasureon and how much vinigar.
I would need to determine the mass of four different samples, then I would sample the marble of the starting mass, then I would make sure that I have labeled of all the samples of starting mass, ending mass and difference on mass. After 24 hours remove the samples from the containers and allow it to dry.
Other information
You would to add the labels again. Then you would have to record your results yet again and then you would check you work.
Additional information needed for the groups procedure is that the group should have stated what kind of samples were needed to perform the experiment. What also could have been identified is the amount of vinegar the student should pour into the composition the sample. Another steps that could help a student when replicating into maybe have an exact measurement of the samples, instead of having each one vary from 7.2 - 11.2. For example maybe have each one way 9.8 to see easier which sample to affected more by acid.
The group's procedure is wrong because they need more time on doing this experiment and if the group just work a little more harder than they did before, then they still have a chance at passing the experiment by taking out the marble and limestone and replacing them with paper or something different, then they can pass the experiment by taking some bad material out and putting new material in.
First you need to know how much vinegar they used in each samples cup. Secondly the amount of each substance should be the same. Next, what kind of container are they placing this substances up out with a lid or lid toowide?
Additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment would include knowing the amount of vinegar that needs to be poured into the containers. I would also need to know what type of containers are being used and where to put these containers during the 24 hour waiting period. Finally, I would need to know the control of this experiment in order to replicate it.
Aluminum foil & Black paper is good to wrap around a cup because you could have one cup in any kinds of shape you want to the cup pluse using aluminum foil hold the cap real tight and the black paper you could put it wet. The alinum paper for it to look like some thing you want it to come out.
You would need to know what materials to get. You would also need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup. They should have told us what to measure the cup with. They should have also told us what type of container to use.
You would need to know how much vinegar to pour, list of materials to use, and how much of each material.
In order to duplicate the experiment I would also need to know what were the samples being used, what king of containers I need (size). I would also need the information that tells me to measure the starting mass of each sample.
After reading the group's procedure, in order to replicate this experiment it must include what types of samples you need., how much vinegar to use, and you need a control to compare the results. A control for this experiment would be to have the four samples sit in water and find the starting and ending mass. The procedure should also include the use of a balance for determining the mass.
The procedure is missing some critical info. First of all the group does not say what the samples are so to remake the lab. I would not know what I needed to get even though it shows it in the table they should have it in the procedure. Also the group does not give details on how much vinegar to put in the containers. Finally the group did not say the size of the container.
One piece of information that would be necessary if replicating this experiment is how much vinegar was used. You would also need to know how much of each sample you would place in the cup. You might also want to know what size cup was used so that the person conducting the experiment could do if exactly the same. On other piece of information that would be helpful is knowing how long for use the saying so that each sample is getting the same amount of H.O applied.
You would need something that measures more then measure it after the time is up there different coloured cups, so its easy to tell the different between the three cups in the same temperature because the temperature can slow and speed up the process.
There are several things this group should have included, in their procedure. They did not specify what type of container or how large. They did not say what type of vinegar or how much to pour into the container. They did not say what to do with the container when you finish. They did not specify how  they determined the mass.
The additional information I would need to show in order to replicate the experiment is how much Vinegar to use, & why this experiment is being done. What is the purpose of this experiment if so I would need to know the types of materials to use.
In order to replicate this experiment; you would need to know: how much vinegar to pour into into each container; what utensil to use to measure the mass of the each sample; and what materials should be measured (i.e marble, limestone)
In order to complete the experiment it would be  necessary to know what the four materials actually are. The procedure simply refers to these unknown substances as samples or materials. Also it is not know  how moch vinegar to use for each substance. Lastly  it is important to know how much of each substance to use. These three factors are important in carrying out this procedure and experiment.
In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know what the sample of the materials is, you need to control group and you need to what you label to your containers.
This procedure is lacking important information which is needed in order to replicate the experiment. The necessary samples: marble, limestone,wood, and plastic, are not listed in the procedure. The amount of vinegar that one must pour in each container is also not stated. These are all needed in order to determine the mass of each sample. Marble, limestone, wood, and plastic.
Some additional information you would  need  a control. You would also need to have the measurements of how much vinegar your putting into each of the samples. Another thing is you would have to list the samples that you are testing in your procedure.
Additional information that should be added and to be started with is a breif introduction of the experiment and the purpose of it. What kinds of mass, should be added in so that can cause confusion. The way I know , what were tha masses was the students data that was recorded. The procedure should also state exactly what neeeds to be recorded like starting and ending mass and the difference in mass.
Additional information you would need to be the exact measurement of the vinegar you are pouring in own cup. You would also need to measure the amount of vinegar after the 24 hours sitting. Also you would need to know what temperature the containers would need to be placed out to receive the most erosion.
In order to replicate this experiment thoroughly, one would need to know the approximate size of each sample, as a 10 inch block of wood and a 10cm block would react differently. Also, are would need to know how how much  vinegar to put in each cap and what the conditions of the room were when you leave the samples for 24 hours.
Well think that you would need all of the same steps in the procedure to repeate it. But don't have to find the mass between each object.
You will need the data chart also the procedure of the exprerement to replicate it.
I want to know how the experiment is related to acid rain, because there is no introduction to describe the purpose. ^p How much vinegar would I pour into the beakers. ^p What materials do I need to conduct the experiment?
I would need to know what the outcome was suppose to be or what it was suppose to look like. The information given is good but doesn't really explain why they were doing this experiment for, but the table was good and understandable.
How much vinegar are whe poring? How long are we rinsing them?
The information not included in the procedure that should be stated is the amount of vinegar added to each of the containers.
To replicate the experiment, you would need to know the amount of vinegar to pour into each sample. In order to get accurate results you would
"After reading the group's procedure, one thing they could add is to specify in the 1st step what they're testing. For example, they could have said, ""determine the mass of marble, limestone, wood, and plastic. Another thing this group could have done is to conduct more trials of the experiment so that they could get valid results. Finally, another thing this group could have said in their procedure, making it easy to replicate is, by specifying the amount of vinegar someone should put in each of the 4 containers."
What I would add in the procedure is that  I what are the materials you need, 2 record your data, 3 what is your conclusion what did you come up with.
The additional information you would need to replicate this experiment is how much vinegar needs to be put in each container. An additional piece of information that would help replicate this experiment is how long should you rinse each rock for because some rocks may absorb water which would add on some weight.
You would need to know how much vinegar would be put into each container, how much each sample should be included in each container, where to place the containers and then where to place the samples during the their in the containers and out.
After reading the procedure, I would like to know the time given for each material. Also, if their were any color changed and what was added to the material.
They should also add in the controlled group to undergo the experiment as well. ^p They also should  indicate the amount of vinegar they was added into each sample. ^p They should measure the temperature at what they dried  their sample.
After reading the group's procedure, additional information I would need to replicate the experiment to the different types of samples I would use, what to label the samples and what should I measure in.
In order to replicate this groups experiments, you would need some additional information. You would need to know what the starting mass of the three objects were; You would need to know how much vinegar to pour into each containers and you would need to know how long to rince each contairer after letting them sit each for 24 hours.
You would need more vinegar and marble, limestone, wood and plastic to replicate the experiment.
The second step should state how much vinegar is used.In step four how much vinegar is used. In step four the amount of distilled water and time used to rinse each sample should be stated.
One additional prire would be to state the materials needed nofier additional pele would be to identify how much vinegar is being poured in the container another additional peice  would be to matie all the materials the same ending mass.
I would need to know what were the four different samples. How much vinegar to pour into the four separate contains. Also what to label the containers and should I leave the container at room temperature or put it somewhere else for the whole 24 hours.
To replicate this procedure you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. It would also be useful to know if the temperature of the room should be. Lastly, they should tell you what size of each sample you should be taking. If they do not add in these things the experiment may have a different result when done by someone else.
The additional information that you would need in order to replicate the experiment are what type of climate the containers have to be in, the size of the containers, and the thickness of the insulating material.
Additional information you would need would be to put more time. A sample to write down the starting time & ending time, & try other samples next time.
In order to replicate this experiment, you would need to know: ^p 1. how they got the mass of the four different samples ^p 2. A list of constants ^p 3. You would have to know how much of a sample you would place into the container of vinegar and if it's the same for all four materials.
The additional information I would need is to know what size the containers should be. I would need to know what to label the containers. Also how much vinegar I have to put in to each container.
For this experiment, I would want to know how much vinegar I should pour into the cup. Pouring different amonts could change the mass. The other information I would need is if I needed to rinse the material in a timely manner (10 sec, 20 sec etc). this could also effect the mass of the material. I would also need to know if the amount of the samples had to be the same size. That also could effect the difference of the mass's.
Wood starting mass (g) 11.2
If someone is going to repeat this lab the procedure should include that type of materials are used.If being repeated the person doing it might not use the same materials.Also the amount of vinegar used in each container should be in there.They should also specify that types of containers are used.Maybe restain types affect the experiment and some don't and they should then made note of that
In order to replace the experiment yal would need additional information including four different samples of what specific material. Moreover yal would need to know the temperature at which the samples were kept. Lastly how much vinegar is reacted for each indivual sample.
The group of students needs to add how big or small the containers should be. Another item that the students did not add was how much vinegar goes in each container. The group also forgot to mention what samples they are using. Without these 3 main information points, nobody could replicate this lab.
To replicate this experiment we would need to know how much vinegar the samples were in,how much of each sample, and what type of containers are being used.
Samples of what, and what is the purpose of the experiment, why should we do it, what do we have to do with the data.
Additional information needed to replicate the experiment would be how much vinegar was added to each of the four separate containers. Also you might say how long to rinse the samples under distilled water for. Finally, the students should also state where to place each cup during the experiment and to dry. You need to know whether it should be in a cold, wet environment or maybe warm & dry.
In order to replicate the experiment, procedure should include the names of the four different samples, the amount of vinegar that should be poured in each cup, and the size of the four identical containers.
In their procedures they would also have to include on how to find the difference in mass. They would have to state that you need to subtract the starting mass from the ending mass. In order to replicate this investigation it is necessary to know now much vinegar is needed in each of the containers. We would also need to know what the units are if their grams and mls.
After reading the group's procedure some additional information I would need in order to replicate this experiment is the amount of vinegar that you would pour into each of the four separate but identical containers. Also you would have to know what the sample material is that you are placing in each of the containers, and finally you would have to mass out each individual container in order to get the actual mass for each sample, and the mass of the samples to container.
First, in order to repeat the experiment I would have to know what's there investigation about and how much of the single sample are we suppost to bot in the container.
Some information needed is that they should tell us what the samples are, what to measure them in  and how much vinigare to use because it will change the experiment alone by not adding the same amounts.
Don't know.
After reading the procedure some things are still unclear. They should say what 4 samples are being tested, not just ''mass 4 samples''. Also, how much vinegar should we pour, and in what sort of container? What should we lable the 4 containers as ? How should the samples be removed from the container ? And as always, what are the materials we need, and our there any important things to note regarding lab safety.
Some additional information that I would need would be how much vinegar do I pour into the containers? In what measurement do I measure the four samples.
One thing that they need to put in their was the amount of vinegar and what was the point of doing these.
The three things that need to be added to replicate this experiment is to place marble, limestone, wood, and plastic each in a different cup filled with vinegar. At the beginning you need to determine the mass of a piece of limestone, marble, wood, and plastic. At the end after you determine the mass calculate the difference in mass by subtracting the first mass of limestone, marble, wood and plastic by by the ending mass of each.
To replicate the experiment, I would need to know the amount of vinegar needed to be poured into each container. I would also need to know firstand what my samples are; I don't want to look for them in the results.
They would also need to include how much vineagar was needed to add to the samples. They also need to include how much of each sample there should be, and that you need to find the difference of the mass at the end of the procedure.
To be able to replicate this experiment, the group would need to add what each sample is. They should also include at what temperature stay left the sample at and lastly they should also add that they must record their data in table, so that all the information is clear.
In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know specifically what materials to start with and the amount of vinegar that I should pour into the four cups. I would also need to know where to store the cups. It would be helpful to know what technique that they used to rinse each sample as well. Much more information is needed in order to accurately replicate this experiment.
In able to replicate this procedure 3 steps must be added: ^p 1) What are the samples. ^p 2) How much vinegar is poured into the 4 containers. ^p 3) What unit of measurement is used to measure it mass. ^p 4) What kind of containers were used.
You need a mearing cup the mearer the mass of energy. Then we get plastic of starting mass.
The additional information that I would need to know is how would I find the mass of any of the materials? How much vinegar do I pour in each of the containers? What do I do to the materials or containers before I let them sit for 24 hours?
One way they could be more clear is by  using how much vinegar into the containers. Also they can write ho to much of the different are needed and if you need  to place the samples in a certain pt.
In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know a few things suppos the PH of acidity of the vinegar. The surface area of the racks can also affect this experiment because the more surface area there is the more stone is in direct contact with the vinegar solution, this contact make one each dissolve faster then a rack with less of a surface area.
a. Tell how much vinegar you used. ^p b.
I would need to know how much of vinegar do I put in the containers how long do I rins the sample for.
What are you going to do after you find the mass of all four samples. How much vinegar did you put in each sample.
To replicate this experiment and make if beff you will have to have va i in more accurate information, an conclusion and a graph.
Additional information needed to replicate this experiment would include: ^p - What kind of four samples are being used. ^p - How much vinegar to pour into the containers. ^p - What kind of containers are being used. ^p - How to to remove the samples and place them into containers. ^p - What to label each of the separate containers.
First of all in order to replicate this experiment you need to know what the materials are. Also the one trying to replicate the experiment needs to know the exact mass of the samples. Finally the procedure must tell the one conducting the experiment the exact amount of vinegar to use.
To replicate their experiment there are three pieces of information missing. How much vinegar they used, how big the containers were and what they were made of and what samples they used. If they added those things in the procedure you would be able to replicate their experiment.
In order to replicate this experiment, it would be important that we know the specific pll of the vinegar which is acidic, therefore it would be below it. We would also need to know what type of wood is being used in the experiment. Finally the most important aspect of the experiment that would need to be determined before replicating would be the amount of vinegar solution that each sample was placed in, the type of plastic is also important to know.
More information that I need is what materials did they put into the containers because they did tell us, and they didn't what they did after they let it sit for 24 hours and before they rinsed the containers. Also they didn't lable each measurement on the chart.
In order to be able to redo this experiment, you need to have all of the information. We need to know more about how they did this experiment. More details is better.
The additional information that is needed, is how  they recorded the experiment. They need to separate that experiment more when mac. Always mineral the determine and compare it to the firod time that you did the experiment. Tell what happen how in the first experiment.
To replicate this experiment you would need to include pieces of additional information. The group of students neglected to specify how much of vinegar that would be poured into each of the containers. When you have put a measurement in your procedures it makes it already more ideal to replicate the experiment.
To replicated the experiment, I would need to know the time at which they began and the time they ended at.
To replicate this experiment you would need to know how many mls of vinegar to use. You would also need to know how much distilled water to rinse the samples with. To replicate this experiment you would need to know what type of containers to use to put the samples in. The type of samples also needs to be stated in the procedure not only in the results.
After adding I determined that
The group was missing how much vinegar they used. More trials for each material would improve this lab.
How much vinegar do you put in the cups ?
They should describe what the samples are, how much vinegar do you put in each container.
Three additional pieces of information I would need would be the size of the samples, how much vinegar poured in each container and I would need a tripple beam before to measure.
The additional information needed would be theamant of vinegar that goes into each container. Youwillalso need to know where yare supposed to leave the samples. They should also include if the samples should be covered or not and include where to dry the samples.
To replicate this experiment i would need to know how much vinegar to use, how big of a sample to use and how long to rinse each sample. Without these you cannot replicate the experiment.
In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know the amount of each sample that is put into the containers. I would also need to know the environment in which the containers where during the 24 hours. Things such as temperature are necessary. I would also need to know how long the samples should be rinsed after the 24 hours.
First, their procedure needs to identify what samples are being tested. Also, they would need to specify the amount of vinegar in each container in step 2. The experiment is also missing a control to compare each sample to. Without a control, we don't know if the mass lost is from vinegar or some other reason.
The additional information I would need to complete this experiment is this. First I would need to know which one to put in first, second how long should I wase wish water. Then finally where should I let them sit in dry in the sun or shade out. So that is the additional information I would need to complete this experiment.
Additional information that is needed to replicate the experiment is how much vinegar is poured into the containers, how much material is needed into the container and how much of the samples do I need.
In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know how much vinegar should be poured in each of the four samples. I also need to know how much is the starting mass of each sample and how much is the ending mass of each sample in order to determine the mass of each sample.
Tell us to do it again.
One thing I would need to know is how much vinegar they poured into each container. Also I would also need to know how long I would rinse the material off far. Finally I would a need to find out what they used to dry or did they leave it on the table.
In order to replicate this as the groups procedure would need to include what the four items they are testing and the group would also need to include the volume of vinegar which the four samples were added to. One last thing that would need to be specified is the concertation of the vinegar. If when the experiment is replicated and a different concentration of vinegar is used different results mass occuree.
Say what kinds of materials there using. Why there doing are experiment.
To do this experiment, you need to know what the samples are, how much vinegar to use, what do you label the containes, and how do you determin the mass?
In order to replicate this experiment one would need to know several things. First, the amount of vinegar added would have to be specified. Second, one would have to observe change in color and size of the samples, if any. Third, the procedure doesn't tell you to find the difference in mass, which you should.
The students should have included information about what the 'samples' were, what type of vinegar to use and how much vinegar to use.
The group will need to put to the following information. What are the four different samples. What type of containers will be needed. Also what size. They will also need to put in there lab is what is the temp of the vinegar. (The temperature should be consistant)
I would need the types of sample materials that are being used. It does not tell me the amount of vinegar to put in the containers so I would need a measure of how much vinegar to put in. Finally, I would also need to know what type of equipment I would use to measure the mass.
To replicate this experiment , you would need to know how much vinegar to pour in each container. Also, for the wood sample you would need to know the type of wood being used. Last, you would need to know the size of the container being used and how to determine the mass of the samples.
To replicate these students experiment you would have to know what the samples are of that you're using. You would also have to know where you're leaving these  containers. And lastly, to replicate this experiment you may need to know the type of container you're putting these in, that and / or the size of the original sample.
To replicate the groups experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar was poured on the samples, as well as how much water you rinsed the samples with. You might also want to know what temperature this experiment was done in, as temp affects the results of them rens.
To repeat this lab I would need to know what kind of vinegar they used. How much vinegar they used and if the containers was covered or not.
After reading this procedure, other additional information you would need to replicate the experiment is in the procedure they should state the materials that there going to be testing instead of saying samples. Another is they should have more controlled valiable instead of other samples tosit for 30 min they should have more to determine what to do with samples and containers. They should have a control to test the results and see how this varied against the control. This is the same information I would need to replicate the experiment.
So far in the procedure they tell you into determine the mass of samples pour vinegar into each cup. Let silt for 24 hours, take samples sit and dry them. You would then received the ending mass and subtract the difference.
To replicate this experiment the information we need is the amount of vinegar that they poured into each cup. Another piece of information we need is what kind of samples they are, because if the data table was caried the water could not follow the procedure. The procedure does not state what the samples are. The last piece of information we need is what are we going to use to determine the mass after it sits fo 30 mins. It does not tell what instrument we need to find the mass.
One thing you would need to know is what use of containers  you need. In step 2 they do not say the size of the container, they just said you need them. Also in step one it just says to determine the mass of four different samples that is very unclear because it does not tell you what samples to measure. Als in step two it does not tell you the amount of vinager to pour into the containers.
"To replicate the ""Acid Baim Experiment"" the samples in step one should be identified to make the directions more clear. There should be a set and constant amount of vinegar, and the amount of time the samples are rinsed should be included. It should also say how to find the mass; whether to use water and a graduated cylinder, or a triple beam balance."
In order to repeat this experiment you would need an electronic balance to measure the mass, cups to put the samples in and water to distill each sample with.
The group needs to add the name of the samples that they are using. They also need to say how much vinegar they need to pour in each container. The experiment also needs a control as evidence to show that some reaction is actually happening.
You would need to know how much of each substance was used in order to replicate the experiment. You would also need to know how much vinegar should be put into the samples because if you use different amounts then the result may not be the same as the original. Thirdly, how large each container should be because if the containers are too small some of the samples may leak out and ruin the results for the acid rain lab.
Although they got some information, I think that in order to replicate the experiment they would need 3 things. The first thing would be to determine how much vinegar you put into each of the containers. Secondly to determine the amount of distilled water used to wash off vinegar, lastly to determine where the samples were staying for 24 hours. If they were to replicate this experiment and did these examples that I have listed than it would be successful.
The group didn't say what the samples are for their experiment in the procedure. They also should have say how much vinegar would be poured into each container. They should tell how much of each sample would be used in each container.
They need to measure the amount of vinegar and only put in one container. You need to measure the mass clearly not just estimate. You get the mass before you do anything to it.
The additional information I would need to replicate the experiment is the materials, all the steps that they did.
To replicate the experiment you would need to add control variant. You will need to make sure that they all stay at the same temperature throught the experiment. Also you will need to make sure that the same amount of vinegar is used in each.
The students could state how much vinegar is needed in each container, explaining weather the sample needs to be submersed compleatly or not.
After reading the group's procedure, to replicate this experiment, I would need a scale, four identical containers, vinegar,  a sample of marble,a sample of limestone,a sample of wood, a sample of plastic , a stop watch, water and labels.
In order to replicate th experiment the students will need to add 5 things. What type of woods, plastic, limestone and marble so for example th wood thy use is hard than the wood you use. How much vinegar needs to be poured in it enough to cover it or not. Also what siz container. Another thing to change how long is each sample rinsed for so some don't absorb more or less water. And finally what temperature does th samples dry at because in higher or lower temperatures or humid environments th samples may dry at a different speed.
I think the project needs to change
First the stat mass should of been the same. It's know a product that they did nothing to they did change, anything you can change the time.
It didn't give enough information.
In order to complete this experiment there are several steps that need to be added to the procedure. For instance, in the beginning of the procedure you need to explain what you would mass out the sample with, and specifically which samples. Also, you need to know how much vinegar to put into the containers. In step 4, the procedure does not explain how you would rinse the samples or at what temperature to do it at these variables if left out of the procedure, can be the result of less accurate results.
1) Gather materials. ^p 2) Pour 20 ml vinegar in each of four separate out idenical containers. ^p 3) Place a samora of the material into the container and label. Reapent with remaining placing a striges sample into a single container. ^p 4) After 24hrs remove the sample from the containers and rines each sample with distilled water. ^p 5) Allow the sample to sit and dry for 50 mins. ^p 6) Determines the mass of each. ^p 7) Clean up where you worked.
In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know how much vinegar was poured into the containers, and I'd also need to know what the volume of the separate but identical, containers were I would also need to know how much water (distilled) was used to rinse off the samples, and for how long did the students rinse the samples, I may also need to know with what in statement the samples were massed in order to replicate the experiment.
The additonal information youwould need to know is; you would need to know if the rock was sitting in the vingeror being shaken. If shaken, you would need to know how hard to shake it. (different prosseces are created)
After reading this groups experiment I have found that to do this experiment over again I would need additional information  additional information would need would include what kind of container do I put the materials in,what size container was used to put the materials in ' what surface or what do I are the materials with, and how much vinegar  would I put in the If separate containers, I would  need all this information to perform of this experiment.
In order to do this procedure perfectly you will have to know what the supplies and materials are before you begin. In order to have a valid trial of data, I would have 3 experiments for the rest of the samples.
After reading the group's procedure, I noticed they didn't measure how much vinegar to pour in each container knowing the measurement will help the expirement be more exact. Another way to improve this expirement is to have more trials becaus there was only one for each sample. Another is where should the samples sit in sun, or indoors, this may have an affect.
The group of students didnot tell us the diffrent samples nor did their procedure tell you to find the starting mass and the difference in the starting mass and ending mass.
You need the type of materials needed, the amount of materials in order to mix the samples and have steps in two different steps inorder to understand it.
The additional information I would need to know in order to repeat this experiment is to know the amount of vinegar in each container, the mass of the four samples and to know what are the four samples used in the experiment. I would need these 3 pieces of information so I can repeat this experiment.
In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know the amount of vinegar in each cup, and that the amount remained constant throughout the experiment. You would also need to know how much distilled water was used to rinse the samples.
A control variable is one of the most important things to include in the procedure and this group did not do so. The procedure should also include how much of the vinegar solution should be poured into the containers because a difference in the amount of vinegar could affect the outcome. It would also be a good thing to mention to record your information so that you won't forget it later on in the experiment.
In the procedure, it does not tell you what the samples are, if you need to use
There is much additional information necessary in these procedure in order for one to be able to repeat it in step 1, the four samples should be specified as marble, limestone etc as they were in the data table. In step 2, how much vinegar (ie in ml) should be desorined as  well as the type of container (a jar/plastic/beaker etc) also in steps vi, determining the mass could be also tried more by saying what type of measurement should be used such as beams. Lastly, there should be a step 7 directing us to find the differences in mass as it does in the data table.
In order for me to replicate this experiment I would need to know at what temperature these samples were kept. I would also need to know the size of the containers so all three can have the same amount. Lastly, I feel that I would need to know what to measure the mass with. By knowing this information I would be able to replicate the experiment.
The additional information I would need to replicate the experiment would be to identify each sample. Also I would need to know much vinegar to pour into each container.
This experiment will need more trials  to see if the results are convincing. The group  needs to add a specific measure of vinegar added to the materials. They need to add how long they rinse each sample after the 24 hours is up.
What the samples are, how much vinegar should be added to each container, where the samples are contained for the 24 hr waiting period.
Want wise the shops, if they wayed with the that they was holdings the thing, if it was dry, how much rinser did put in it.
The information that you will need is the measurement, hypothesis conclusion because you want neccessarily find out what will happen next without these three things. These are the main things you need to replicate the experiment.
You would need the names of the samples you were using.
To repeat the experiment I would have to know much vinegar I am pouring into containers. I need to  know room temperature or temperature to see p it affects it also how long do we rinse the sample for is it in to get all the stuff off or just get it a little wet.
The students need to have identical materials for this could validate the expirement because mass has an effect on vinegar dissolution. A quantity of vinegar needs to be specified, as some may be dissolved quicker with more solution. Finally, the temparature of the area in which the expirement is being conducted needs to be noted because some may work better in heat or cold. A constant temparature needs to be known for the expirement to be valid.
The procedure given doesn't have enough information so that someone could replicate it. What else is needed is to state the different samples needed. It also needs to identify how much vinegar goes into each container for the samples. Lastly, we need to know what kind of containers (how big) each of them are.
You would need the specific amount of vinegar used for the experiment to replicate it. You would also need to know what the specific samples were and the volume of the containers so that the experiment sould be replicated.
Some additional infomation I would need to replicate this experiment would be a certain a mount of vinegar I would need to put into each cup, exactly what materials I am to add in each of the four cups, and also how to remove the samples from the containers.
In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know what materials were used, the amount of vinegar that is needed and exactly how the group measured the mass both before and after the experiment.
The students have to measure the four different samples when they remove the samples from the containers and rinse each sample with distilled water. They have to measure before the ending mass because it may different than the ending mass.
Additional infomation that you would need to replicate this experiment is to remember to write in the procedure to record data. Also name the four different samples you will be working with. Also make sure you work with one sample at a time.
I would include what the samples are (wood, marble etc) and would label the containers that way. I would include the brand of vinegar or kind of vinegar used. I would also include at what temperatures the samples were kept at.
"After reading the groups procedure, the additional information that I would need to replicate this experiment would be a control. They don't have anything to compare their data to, they should have used acid rain and distilled water as there experiments. Also they didn't show the number of trials which should be more than one so they could get an average and get more valid data. The group also should have told me the amount of vinegar to put into each cup and the amount of ""one material"" in each cup. I have an idea how much ""one material"" is."
To replicate this experiment you would need to state you problem. What is the person for this lab also you need to indicate your independent and dependent variables.
First, you would need to know what materials to use as samples. Second, you would need to know how much vinegar to put in each container. Lastly, you would need to know what conditions to keep the containers at.
Know all the materials they used and what the wight of each of the materials were before they were placed in the water.
The amount of vinegar stated in procedure # z. ^p The type of container for each substance. ^p How much distilled water you would need to rinse
In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know the amount of vinegar to pour into each container, how to label the containers and how long to rinse the samples for.
Two samples of each material must be collected make two charts, one for your first trial and one for the second. Calculate the averages from your two trials.
After reading the groups procedure, the additional information needed to replicate the experiment is a control because there is no control in the experiment. The type of containers needs to be known because the size can affect on how much vinegar is absorbed. Also,they do not mention how much the samples are, record so their experiment cannot be repeated with the hope of having the same results.
Some additional information you would need to replicate this experiment would be how much vinegar should be put in each container. If not specified, someone may put too little  or too much, and the results can come out very differently. You would also need to know how much of each sample you need to put in the containers and you need to know how long to rinse each sample and where the samples should dry.
If I wanted to replicate the experiment I would need to know what kind of containers to use, I would need to know if I should cover the samples in the containers I would also need to know what the samples are. How am I suppose to know what I am tasting if I don't know what the samples are.
Additional information that would be needed. We need to know how much vinegar to putt in each sample, what temperature to keep sample at, and how long to rinse the samples for.
I would need to know if there was any specific material we needed like special wood or plastic. Some other information I would need is what kind of vinegar they used white or red. One last thing would be, does it matter what you dry them with just in case it could effect it
You need to determine what will happen after the the investigation how will it happen need berck down the steps.
"To properly replicate the Acid rain experiment, you would need more information than is given in the current procedure. You would need to know what materials the "" four different samples"" are in step one, how much vinegar to put in the "" separate, identical containers"" in step two nd specify each sample goes in its own container, rather than only ""plase in in single sample in a single container."
In order for me to replicate this group's procedure, I would need to have the problem their hypothesis. Also the independent and dependent variables.
I think what I will do is to change the procedures. Instead of leaving the samples sit for 24 hours, I'll let them sit for 48 hours, I'll let them dry for 60minsand
you would need an experiment contron, a problem statement and for precision you need more than one trial for each sample
To replicate the acid rain experiment, the group would have to include, how much vinegar to pour into the containers, what the starting mass of each rock should be and the amount of water the samples are rinsed with.
1. Gather materials. ^p 2. Put on apron & goggles. ^p 3. Set up materials. ^p 4. Por vinegar into a identical containers. ^p 5. Put marble, limestone, wood, plastic into their separate containers. ^p 6. Put name on container, wait 24 hours. ^p 7. Rinse the samples with distilled water. ^p 8. Put samples out to dry. ^p 9. Determine the mass & other differences. ^p 10. Clean up materials.
Additional information that is needed to replicate this experiment would consist of three things. Number one used be the amount of vinegar poured into the four separate beakers.I would also need to know what is the ML size of the identical beaker of size altered or not. The
First off, we need to know how we should be measuring the mass, like with what kind of scale. They should also specify what units we are using such as grams. They also don't tell us how much vinegar to pour into these containers.
In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know what samples they used. Another piece of information I would need is how much vinegar do I use for each sample. Lastly, I would need to know the question that the group of students are trying to answer.
In the procedure, they never said how to the difference in mass(g) and what it means. Also it never said how much vinegar to pour in each container Also they never said what of the samples were.
One piece of information needed would be what samples to use as it is not indicated in the procedure. Another would be how much at the sample to put in the container.Also the procedure doesn't state what temperature to allow the samples to sit when they are.
This group left out some important details when writing their procedure. In order to replicate this experiment, I would also need to show what I would measure the mass with & how, the amount of vinegar I should put into each container & what the other materials would be. These 3 things would help me to replicate the experiment better.
"The group neglected to include what the ""four different samples"" are. They should have said, ""use a scale to determine the individual mass (g) of four different samples of material; marble, limestone, wood and plastic"". They also were too vague in describing putting vinegar in containers. They should have included how much (ml) vinegar should be poured into each container, what containers are made of. They also never included how large in size the samples should be and did not make a control in the experiment to compare the end results to. They also never listed the materials that needed to be used."
The way you would replicate the experiment is by repeating the procedure but just use a different sample ingredent.
In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know what I would measure to measure the mass with a sale. Second, I would need to know to measure the mass in grams. Third, I would need to know if I should round the mass to the nearest tenth or hundreth of the gram.
In this experiment they give all the things you need to do  but not with enough detail. In order to replicate this experiment you would need to know how much vinegar goes in each container. It may be the same but we need to know a measurement. Also another thing you would need to know is how to label and understand each sample,  for instance we don't know if a certain substance goes in a certain container. Lastly they don't explain how they determined the mass.  In order to repeat the experiment you would have to know what  they used to measure the mass.
The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment form a hypothesis. Draw a conclusion. Say what you are experimenting.
After reading the procedure, some additional information that I would need in order to replicate the experiment is a clear indication of what the four different samples are. I will also need to know what their controlled variable was and the exact mass that went into each container. I will also need to know what amount of vinegar went into each container and if this amount varied between the different containers.
To replicate the procedure you would also need to know that the samples are marble, limestone, wood and plastic. Second thing you need to know is what type of wood because some woods are harder than others the last thing you need to know is how much vinegar is in each asp.
One thing missing from this experiment is the percise measurement of vinegar pour experiment. You would also need to have the samples all the same size. Thirdly, you need to know the size of the container when repeating this experiment.
In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know which sample is going in which container, you would need to record all of the masses of each sample and make sure all the masses are the same. You would also have to pour the same amount of vinegar on each sample.  After the 24 hours, rinseing samples and letting each sit for 30 minuets you would weigh each sample again and see which one is most different in mass.
To repeat the experiment you waid first have to know how much vinegar to pour into each of the containers. You would also need to know the amount of each sample that was measured to get their masses. You waid also need to know if you should cover the samples and at what temperature they should be left to sit in for 24hrs. Also, what would you do with the samples once you removed them from the containers, where would they sit?
I will need to collect all of my materials. i will need four containers and my four samples. i will have to place the four samples in the containers. Then put
If you want to replicate the experiment you will need more containers exactly alike, marble, limestone, wood and plastic, also fresh cups of viniger.
Additional information that would be needed is how much vinegar was added to each sample, how did the students figure out the ending mass, and where did they place the samples in the period of 24 hours.
In order to replicate the experiment it would have been better if they put in how much vinegar to go in each container. They could shortened the time that each sample had to stay in a container. They could have stated how to determine the mass and what unit to use. They could have also seen sipecific or what type of container can be used for the experiment.
To replicate the acid rain experiment you would need to know what size container to use,you would also need to know what the four different samples were. Lastly, you would need to know how long to note samples for.
After reading this groups procedure, there are four different pieces of information I would need to replicate this exact experiment. One, the group must include what the 4 samples are, anyone reading this procedure would not know what the experiment was testing. Two, you must include the amount of vinegar being poured into each separate container. Thirdly, they must include under what conditions should the samples be left for the 24 hours. Lastly, I would need to know what types of containers these samples should be placed in, should they be put in plastic or glass or even open or closed containers?
In order to replicate this experiment one would need to know some additional information. First of all, it would be helpful to know how much vinegar needs to be poured into the containers. Also, from the student's written procedure one does not know what materials the 4 samples are. That would also be helpful. Lastly, it would be important for the student to include that at the end of the experiment that they took the difference in mass.
In order to replicate this procedure, it would have to tell what the samples are. There is no way of correctly replicating if the wrong samples are used, which could happen without proper explanation.
They didn't come up with the independent &  dependent variable ^p - Make up a question ^p - Create a hypothesis
In order to figure out how to replicate this I would need to know the containers size. Also I would need to know how much vinegar to put in. I would need to know how long to wash with water for.
"Some additional information that would be needed are specific things. First, the procedure can specifically give the amant of vinegar that has to be put in the containers. The experiment can also describe the materials since the word ""materials"" can mean almost anything. The experiment also needs a control such as using water instead of vinegar."
To replicate this experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar was poured in the containers,you would also need to know how to determine the mass of the samples and you would also need to know more information on the containers.
After reading the procedure in order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much of each sample  there  was. Also, you would need to know what kind of vinegar they're  using, as well as how much to pour into the container. You  might also need to know how long to rinse each sample and if it was with warm or cold water.
First piece of information I would add is the name of the different samples and how much vinigar was put in to the container when you started. Then when you finish how much vinigar was in the container.
Additional information I would need to replicate this expiriment is how to determine the mass of each sample, also to take the masses of the samples before putting them in the vinegar & to compare the masses of before vinegar &after.
To replicate the experiment they would need to know how much vinegar was put in each container. They also need to get rid of the ''determine the mass of four different samples'' and instead say mesure the starting weight of the samples.
You would also need to include a list of supplies, a hypothesis and amounts of how much vinegar and of the samples is needed.
This group needs a control. They need something that won't change. They also need them to have all the ^p samples with the same starting mass. Lastly i was never told how much vinegar i should into the container. ^p That is important to know because you cant guess for how much to put in.
The temperature they were left at, know what substance the samples were, what temp the distilled water should be.
The groups prosedure could  use, they could add to find the diffrence in mass at the end. Also list the type of meteral they roused. And they should tell you how much and what kind of vinegar they foused.
1)You will need to know the temperature of which to keep the samples at. ^p 2)The surface are in each of the samples exposed to the vinegar. ^p 3)How much vinegar to put the samples in.
In order for me to replicate this experiment I would need to come up with an hypothesis, the reason why I am doing this experiment and a conclusion.
While doing this experiment some additional information that you may need to know are what is the reason they are doing this experiment, for  what is the problem? Another thing is what is the final anwser that they are looking for they also need to follow the scientific method in order to complete their investigation.
You would need to know how much vingar is need and what is the purpose of the experiment.
In order to replicate the experiment you would need to know what kind of vinegar you would put the samples in, how much vinegar you would put each sample in and how many times would be needed to rinse each sample of the vinegar.
To replicate the experiment, you would need to know the what the previous problem statement was, without a problem statement there is no purpose for doing the experiment. you would also need to know who the groups.... hypothesis was. By knowing the hypothesis you'll something to compete with your findings. And last the group should have said their control. ^p This will give you data to base your exams findings onto.
The additional information that I would need is how much vinegar do you put in the containers, what are the four samples to put something over the containers, and what are steps of the samples.
I think the next step is to see what mass is the highest the normal one and the lowest is. We want to add it up to see what mass is better, we need to see what sample looks good because you don't want to have a bad one.
In order to replicate this expirement they would have to
Specify what the samples are in step 1. Specify how much vinegar in step 2. Specify the size of the container in step 2. In step 4 specify how one should remove the samples from the containers.
The additional information you would need in order to replicate the experiment would be first, naming the four different samples given to you. Secondly, you would need the amount of vinegar needed to pour into the containers and what kind of containers. Thirdly, you would need to know how you would determine the mass (example, with an electric balance). The students need to be more specific on their materials.
Additional information I would need in order to replicate the experiment would be how much vinegar for each samples, a control group and a dependent variable.
When the group said to place a sample of one material into the o ther container then repeat. It does not make sense because people could repeat putting the sample into all the containers back to back. You don't have to wait 24 hours for letting the sample sit in the container.
In order to copy this experiment you need to know what samples to use, for example list the marble, limestone, wood and plastic. Also starte how much vinegar to pour or how little same with the distilled water. And what will you use to determine the mass of the samples.
Additional information needed to replicate this experiment can be a number of this. One important thing would be how much vinegar are you pouring in the containers. Without putting the same amount, it can change the mass of the samples. Another thing is in step three the material and what you are labling should be stated. How are you going to know what to label it as and what material it is.
Why they are doing this exparament?  what the problem is how much vinagar is needed. What is the controll  for the experament ;
What I would need it to maybe is to let the samples sit and dry for more than 80 minutes ^p Also multiply the last row for starting mass, ending mass, difference in mass. Be they repeat it.
Additional information would consist of its shape, resistance and total masses lossed to complete the experiment.
One piece of information needed to replicate the experiment would be material starting because it could or from the. Another would be how many of each sample you are puting in the cup. And the last could be if there was a control to the experiment.
The additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment is to have a control for each of the four different samples, also measure the amount of vinegar being poured and 24 hours exactly being washed.
First things i would need to know would be how much vinegar to pour into each containers. Another thing that may or may not be a determining factor in this experiment would be the each temperature and the temperature of the vinegar. Lastly, i would need to know which samples increased because i could have different samples than them.
One thing i would need is what the samples were because samples is over basic word and can mean anything. Also i would need to know what the containers looked like, so i know what kind of containers i should hecking for this experiment. Last, the procedure should add the constants for the experiment so i know what not to change.
In this procedure I would of also mentioned weighing the rocks, I would at stated how much vinegar you pour in each container and I would of listed how to find the mass.
Some of the additional information that will be needed is how much vinegar will be poured in the containers also will need four containers a balance bean to weight it and the samples.
The following additionnl information I would put is record the difference in mass after the beginning and ending of each mass.
After reading the group's procedure I would need to know what kind of samples was I supposed to got and how much I need to use for this investigation so I can replicate the experiment.
The procedure left out some information that is needed. For step three, it doesn't specify what material or what size container to put the material in. It should also tell you to do repeated trials.
"Fix this experiment, the procedure needs additional information. For example, the four different samples or how many or what kind of containers. Then it needs to state how much of each ""sample"". This procedure needs to be more descriptive and precise so people doing the experiment gets it done correctly."
In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know how much vinegar to put into the containers.
Maybe after the experiment this procedure should be done a second  time to see the results come out, the name react ways.
In order to replicate the experiment  I'd need to know what 4 different samples I needed, I'd also need to know the amount of vinegar to pour in each container I'd need to know what I'd use in order to determine the mass.
After I had finish reading the information,I think I would need four types of vinegar but identical and four containers then I would need to determine the mass of each sample.
There are three things you would need to know to replicate this experiment. You would need to know how much vinegar you needed to add to each of the four containers. Another thing you would need to know is if the four samples all needed to have the same initial weight or mass or size. Lastly the proceedure needs to tell you how to record your data. Also you need to know what they are comparing their data to their control and constants.
The additional information I would need to know to replicate this experiment would be how much vinegar in pouring into the containers what was in each different sample and why they picked the samples. I will also need to see the constant and independant and dependent factor.
"This group needs to include quantitative information such as, ""How much vinegar"". This group should try to eliminate the use of the word ""sample"", it can be confusing to someone which sample they are talking about. I also think it would be better, if possible, to use the same mass for all samples, this will show the change in porportion to how much of the material."
The additional information that you would need is the statement, why were you doing this and were the results right or wrong. Such as this the type of result you were looking for.
You would have to know how much vinegar to put into the containers. You would also have to know what environment  to put the cups in, in the sun would cause different effects than inside or in a shady area. ^p Lastly, you would have to know what you put then to and leave them on a paper towel inside, or on a table, etc.
In order to replicate the experiment, I would need to know what type of samples I should use in the experiment. Just saying samples is not specific enough. I should have the exact type of material. I also need to know the exact amount of vinegar to use in the experiment. Should I use a lot of vinegar, or a little? 4 ml amount of vinegar is needed to replicate the experiment. I also need to know how to find the difference in mass. In procedure says to determine the mass of each sample but it does not say how to find the difference which is what will solve the problem in the experiment.
1.How much vinegar & how big a container? (Were the samples completely covered?) ^p 2.What temperature did the samples sit at? ^p 3.Rinse samples how long or until what desired effect ?
Some additional information you would need would be the names of the four samples being used in the procedure, the amount of vinegar put in each cup and the size of the cups being used. You would also need to be told to determine the difference in mass.
I would need to know how much vinegar to put in each cup. I would also need to know if the samples had to be anything in paticular. Do you have to have the four samples related to each other or can they be random items? How long do I rinse the sample in distilled water for?
The first bit of information that you need is how  vinegar is needed in the four different containers. They never said what to use to determine the mass and they never said what kind of samples.
To replicate this experiment you will need to also include what type of sample to get. I could get any thing I saw and it would fit the description in the procedure. You also need to include how big the containers should be and how much vinegar to put into them. You should also include how to find the mass using what measuring system.
The students would also need to keep recording every thing they see.
1st you need the sample to be the same amount as every other sample, then you need to put same amount of vinegar in all containers and try wasting 1day the 2days to see what would happen.
The procedure does not state what the  four samples they are testing. They have to be clear and actually name them also. We do not know how much of each sample to place in the container. It should have a constant mass for each of the samples. The procedure does not state how much vinegar to pour in H2O it is very important to know the amount that they put in.
You also would need to know how much vinegar to use, what kind of vinegar to use and the 4 different samples.
After reading the group's procedure, there is much additional information that i would need in order to replicate the experiment. First off, you would need to know what the samples are, and what size of samples you will testing. Another piece of information that you would need would be the amount of vinegar that you'd pour in the containers (step two). From steps one and six, you are supposed to determine the mass of all four of the samples that to do this you would need to know what you are taking the mass in. (ie grams, pounds,ouples)
The things that they could've included would be, that they need a constant, they need to specify how much vinegar is in each container and also to include the number of trials to do.
To replicate this experiment one would have to know what is meant by the word samples, in other words, samples of what? One would would also have to know what type of container each sample be placed in. Should the samples be placed in a beaker  graduated cylinder or a crucible or any other laboratory container? One would also have to know for how long and how vigorously each sample should be washed after 24 hours.
To replicate the group's experiment, 5 other things I would need to know are: ^p 1) What samples. ^p 2) How much vinegar I need to pour. ^p 3) How much of the samples I need to pour into each container.
If I were to replicate this experiment, I would need to know how much of each sample was used. I would also need to know how much vinegar was added to the container. Also, the size of the container would be helpful. I might also need to know how much distilled water to use when rinsing each material.
Additional information needed would be the amount of vinegar poured into each container. I would also need to know if the sample much be a certain size
Additional information I would need to know would include several things. I would need to know what the four samples of material are. I would also need to know the amount of vinegar to pour in each container. I would lastly need to know what type or size my containers need to be.
First, you would need to know what samples are going in the cup. Also, we need to know how much vinegar we are pouring into the samples. Finally to duplicate this experiment you would need to know how much of the sample goes in each cup.
Some additional information that we would need in order to replicate this experiment is observations of what the samples looked like before, during and after the chemical reactions. Also, we would need to know the mass of the cup to make sure we are just calculating the mass of the four and lastly, you need to re-check your calculations.
In order to replicate the experiment, we would need to know what different samples to use. They show  4 samples in the data table, but in the procedure it only says ''four different samples'' which can be misleading and confusing. We would also need to know how much vinegar  to put in each. Lastly, in order to replicate the group's procedure we would need to have a control variable that we could compare the results to.
The group's procedure is missing a couple of elements. For one, they need to tell the reader how much vinegar to put with each sample secondly, they need to record the size of each sample. They need to determine how much rinsed water is needed to wash all the samples.
In order to replicate the procedure, you need to know when other materials you will need, what samples you need.
You will need to add in step 4 where to remove the samples. How to determine the mass of the samples. What materials to use for the sample. These were additional information needed in order to replicate the experiment.
First you would name the four distrant substances, say the size of the container also how much of each substance in each container should be specified. Overall this experiment needs to be more spesific and valid for this lab to be repeated
I would need to know what step are testing, what the independant variable is, what size be samples they are talking about. I would also need to know what other variables are controlled.
To replicate the experiment, the first thing that a group would need is a control variable. Second, we would need to know where to put the samples after taking them out of their containers. In able to complete this experiment. Lastly we would need to know what kind of temperature condition to put the samples in. In able to have the experiment preesse.
In order to replicate this experiment, we would need to know how much vinegar to put in the containers. We also would need to know how they plan to measure the mass of each sample. Another thing we would need to know before we could replicate this experiment, what the hypothesis is.
The additional information that would be needed is a control which could be no water added, 3 or more trials to make sure that their data is valid and also how much vinegar and water was used in the experiment.
In their procedure, the studants weren't very clear on what the samples were. If they didn't have that table, I wouldn't have known what their samples were. They also didn't list all the materials they used for this experiment. So if I tried to repeat it, I could only guess the materials they used. These students also weren't very descriplive in the procedure. The way they worded some of the steps was very confusing. They needed to make it clearer.
The additional information that i would need to replicate this experiment is what size containers will be needed what size of marble, limestone, wood and plastic will be needed also what kind of vinegar was used if specified.
In order to replicate the experiment, one would need to know some background information on the properties of marble, limestone, wood and plastic. Specifically, their chemical makeup and the elements contained in the samples. A second piece of information you would need to know is if there should be multiple trials. Thirdly, one would need to know the effect of acid rain on the samples physical properties in order to determine a valid hypothesis/conclusion.
The experimental procedure does not specify the amount of vinegar to be used, the mass of the samples to be used or the type of wood and plastic. The experiment cannot be replicated without this information because the scientist does not know the amount and type of materials that the group of students used in their experiment. It is impossible to know if the experiment being performed is correct if the amount and type of materials are not specified.
In order to replicate the experiment, you would need to know about acid rain and the products you are testing, how to calculate mass, know how to compare the mass of the product before and after the experiment.
After reading the group procedure I would add what the four different samples were for step 3 I would use a example like price marble into one container and label it made so other would be able to make clearly see the steps I took after step ca I would add determine the difference between the ending mass and the starting mass record the difference in mass other information i would are: 1) how to determine the mass and 2)how much vinegar to pour.
I would need to know the amount of vinegar that is being poured in the containers. With what am I going to measure the mass of each sample. I think that I would also need to know the problem that is trying to be solved (specifically, what am I trying to find out).
In this experiment you will need to add more information like in the produre like how did you set up the sample to begin off with. Also it never said that the samples were in a container and need to include that in the beginning. But it did  look like a good experiment to do and how they poured vinegar on each sample and let it sit only the Limestone changed the most and the other sample stayed almost the same in the start and end mass.
If you were to replicate the experiment described in the procedure, you would also need to know some additional information. You would need to know how much vinegar you were supposed to pour on each cup or this could show the resulted. The procedure also does not reveal what four types of samples should be used in the experiment. It is important that the procedure when talking about weighing the samples, says to use the same scale for all the masses.
To repeat this experiment you would have to know how much of each sample to put in the container. You would also need to know how much vinigar to pour into the containers. Another thing you would need to know is where you let them sit in dry because the results could change depending on temperature, light exposure, and other factors.
Determine the mass of four different samples.
I would need to know the amount of vinegar to put in the four containers. I would also need to know where to leave the containers from temp) also, what should I remove the samples with? (tongs)
To replicate this procedure I'll need to know the size of the containers. I'll need to know the samples and I'll also need to know the amount of vinegar to put in each container. The amount of vinegar and the size of the container could be important variables if they are not the same for each sample.
The additional information I need in order to replicate the experiment is the amount of vinegar I pour in each of the containers; how big or small the containers have to be; and whether or not I should close the containers.
You would need to know the amount of vinegar poured in each seperate container, also you would need to know what the sample is and if you should put the containers in a very dark or sunny place for 24 hours.
In order to replicate the experiment I would need to know the amount of vinegar they used in each container, the type of container, what they mean by a four different samples, (if not given data table), as well as the form of the rock, liquids, crushed whole etc).
Three additional pieces of information i would need to be able to replicate the experiment is; first, how much vinegar do you place in each container, what are the samples you should use, and third what is the controle to show that vinegar is what changes the mass, those are the three things i would need to know so that i can replicate the acid rain experiment.
I think they would need safety goggles and gloves to be safe. They could of extended the time. So, instead of being for 24 hours, it can be 48 hours for best results. I would actually give the samples 24 hours to dry because there is water inthe sample and it needs to evaporate.
"In order to replicate the ""acid rain"" experiment it is essential to know what the samples are.In the step 1 it says to determine the mass of four samples. What are the samples? Also, how are we supposed to find the mass of the sample? In step 2, it says, pour vinegar in each four seperate but identical containers. What is the size of the container and what type of vinegar is used? Also in the 4th step, it says, to rinse each sample with distilled water. For long should the sample be rinsed?"
In order to replicate this experiment, more information is needed. It would be important to know how much vinegar into each container. It would also be useful to know about what size the containers should be. Finally, to be sure the experiment is replicated exactly, it would be important to know what type of wood samples was used, as different woods have different properties.
You would need to know what to make the four samples out of how much vinegar to add. How much sample to add into each solution. In order to replicate this experiment.
One piece of information you would need to replicate this experiment would be the measurement for the vinegar. How much should you have in each container? Another bit of information not included is how you are measuring the mass and how much at each sample should be used in each containers for example (1in*2in) marble square.
The additional information you would need to know from the groups procedure to replicate the experiment is the type of sample, how much vinegar in each container and what s the size of materials that you put in the vinegar.
Number 2, pour vinegar in eatch of the four seperate not identical containers. This can help determen the mass of eatch item and help with the experement from what we read, after placing samples into the container then letting it sit will determen the mass.
To determine the mass of four different samples, to pour vinegar in four seperate container. Place a sample of one material into one container and label. After 24 hrs remove the samples from the containers, allow the samples to sit and dry for 30 min and finally determine the mass of each sample.
We would need to replicate steps 1-6 for samples. ^p marbles, limestone, wood, plastic. ^p What kind of containers? ^p If the containers are dry, it can change the difference in the mass.
In order to replicate this experiment, we would need to know the temperature of the vinegar as well as how much vinegar to put in. Both of these could vary and therefore change the result of the experiment.
Changing the type of grafin would improve the student's experiment give a better new at those data. ^P Give the names of each type of plastic type used in this experiment. Each plastic should be the same length. ^P My conclusion is plastic type held up a much stronger than all of the different types.
Concluding from the students data that plastic type B was the stretchiest, while type A is the least stretchy. Two ways that the students could have improved their experiment is to have described how much height to use. Another way that they could have gotten more valid results is clarify how much plastic to use, hanging of the table.
Two ways that the stundent could've improved the experiment is by getting a more better brand of plastic or simply redo the experiment.
A conclusion I can make from this experiment is that plastic type B is the stretchable because in trial one it stretched 22mm,while in trial two it stretched 23mm without breaking. One way the student can improve the design is by adding more weights. A second way is to include more trials so there is more to compare to.
a.One conclusion I can draw is that plastic B stretched the most than there was plastic D, the next plastic C and finally plastic A. b. They could have used more trials. Two trials is not enough to have a valid experiment. Next they could have said how long each plastic had to be. If there is more or less on one plastic then there could be more polymers making the experiment invalid.
My conclusion to this experiment is that plastic sample B streched the most because it was probly a sample streches easily.^p B) Two things that could be changed is saying what kind of plastic it was and saying hope much weight is put on each clamp.
You can conclude that plastic B was the most maluble and was able to stretch the most while plastic A was the most rigid and least stretchable. Two ways the experiment could have improved was to also test for longer amounts of time, to see if time was a factor. Using different wights for different trials could also give out more beneficial data.
By looking at the results, one can see that plastic type B and D stretched almost twice as much as the other two types. This shows us that B and D are most likely low density polymers because of their flexibility. A and C however are not as flexible and therefore are high density polymers. The experiment could have been improved by adding another plastic type or running more trials. The weights could have been changed also to test the strength.
Material type A stretched the least, and material type B stretched the most. Material type B stretched about 12 mm more than A. A few ways the student could have the experiment is be could have gotten different length plastic to test it different ways. Also he could have added more trials and averaged them together to get more accurate results.
a) A conclusion about this data is that plastic type A+B stretched longer the second trial and that type C stretched longer the first and D stayed the same. You can also conclude that plastic B has greatest stretchability. B) Two ways [the students could have improved the experimental are sign is that they could have done more trials to increase validity. They also could have used the same length of different plastics each time.
a. Plastic type B is proven to be the most strehable material because it has stricthed to the greatest length which was 22mm and 23 mm. b. 2 ways to improve the experiment is there should be 2 trials and the size of each material before being stretched should be held constant.
A) Based on the student's data, I can draw the conclusion that plastic type A is the most duriable because it stretched the least (an average of 11mm), while plastic type D is the least duriable. ^P B) To improve this experiment, the student's could have added a control and specified how much weight should be added to the clamp.
Based on the student's data, plastic B stretched more. b The students could have improved the experiment by resting the plastics at the same length  also by doing more than just two trials using sam. Putting same amount of weight in the type of plastic bag.
a) The students concluded that platic B was the most flexible, stretching up to 23mm on the second trial and 22mm on the first. b) The student could have improved this design and validity of his lab in two ways. First he could have done the experiment a third time to further confirm results. Second, the student could have been more descriptive in his procedure explaing how to add weight to the clamp and how much weight to actually add.
Based on the students data, it looks like all 4 types of plastic stretched at least 10mm. The most amount stretched was 22mm for plastic type B then 20mm for D, 14 mm for c and 10mm for A. ^p To make the experiment more valid the student could perform more trials maybe using a different type of clamp or other weights to  test the plastic's flexibility.
A conclusion that can be drawn from the students data is that plastic B has the most stretchability. Two ways this student could have imposed the experimental design and or validity of the results is. The students could have said what the initial length of the plastic was and keep all the others plastics at the same length because if one plastic was longer than the other the experiment would be valid. And they also say how much the weights that were being used weighed because one could be heavier than the other.
A conclusion that can be made based on this experiment is plastic type D stretches the most, plastic type D stretches the second most, plastic C the third most and plastic A the least most. The students could have improved the validity of the experiment by including another trials. Also including what size or how heavy of a weight to use for in the experiment.
A. Based on this student's data, I conclude that trial 2 was more effective.^p B. One way the student could have improved the experimental design is give the names of the plastics they used.
a) In conclusion, plastic type A is the strongest plastic and plastic type D is the weakest plastic because it streched the most. ^P B) the student should have made sure all the plastic lengths were equal. The experimenter should have also tested them all at the same time to get accurate data.
As shown in the data table, I can conclude that plastic type B was able to stretch the most in the 5 minutes.  The table also shows that plastic type A stretched the least, concluding it was very strong or had less polymers. Two ways the students can improve their experimental design would be to make sure that all the plastic samples were the same length. Another way the students can improve the experiment would be to include the weights so an independent variable can be clearly stated/seen.
a. Based on the students data I can conclude that T2 overall had better results that T1, for T1, A, B and C were all longer than T1. ^p 3b. The student could have improved the experimental design and for validity of the results by specifying the amount of weight that was added to the clamps and the student should also have specifyed the plastics that were used to make a more valid point. ^p A-10, 12. ^p B-22, 23. ^p C-14, 13. ^p D-20, 20.
The second trail the first two numbers are higher then the two in the first trail. One number lower than the first time and the number the same, one way the could improve there experiment is they could of made a graph with there results.
The question in this experiment is how many weights did it take take for the plastic to inicate while measuring. The conclusion was that T2 was more of a success. One way the student could have improved was explaing how heavy each weight was and how best you should add each weight to the clamp. Another way they could've improved was using the exact type of plastic with the same measurements.
"(a) Plastic type ""B"" is made of the stretchiest material. (b) It does not say how many or how heavy the weights added are causing the results to be innacurate. Also, the length is not the same for any trials or type of plastic."
Plastic type ''B'' contains the most elasticity. The could have explained was some of the different procedures were used for and to be more clear on explaining the procedure because when you explain a procedure you want to explain it in a way that any one can prefer in it.
In conclusion, based on the students data collected, plastic type B was the farthest stretched. One way to improve the validity of their design to have different sizes of the plastic samples used. Another way to increase the validity is to get wide range of the different types of plastics.
a) The plastic type B has the greatest stretchability out of the other 3 types. ^p b) The student should be clear about the length of each plastic to ensure that only independent variable is the type of plastic. Also, the student must determine the weight of the weights clamped on the plastic to keep one independent variable (plastic type). It is important to keep your constants, constant.
Based on the student's data it looks like they wanted to see if their type of plastic had an effect on how far it can stretch. Plastic type D must be hard plastic because for both trials one and two the plastic did not move 1 mm. The students could have improved their results by telling us how much weight they used. Without the amount of weight no one knows how much to use so our results will be different. Also, in step 1 the students did not say how long the plastic must be cut.
I conclude, based on the data, that out of the four different polymer plastics, plastic type B was able to stretch the most mm, 23mm. Other plastic type such as A only stretched 12mm; plastic type C only stretched 13mm and plastic type b only stretched 20mm.
A: Based on the data I can conclude that plastic B had the most stretchability it stretched 22 and 23 mm. C 14 and 13mm and D 20,20 mm were in between. ^p B. One way the student could have improved their experiment design is to clerify everything. What plastic, how long are they etc. They could improve their validity by doing three trials instead of two.
Plastic type A seems to have been stretchy because it was stretched 2mm while B and C only stretched 1mm. And type D is not stretchy because the number stayed at 20mm. The student could have used something heavy doing with tape to hold it on the table in ease it came off and they could have also used something better than a clamp to stretch it.
A. My conclusion is that, based on the data, plastic B has the most stretchability. ^p B. The student could have improved the experiment by doing a third trial, and if needed, a fourth. The student could also have repeated the process to find out why T1 data is different from T2 data.
Plastic type B is the most stretchable plastic out of the 4 reaching 22-23mm. to improve this expierment the person doing the lab needs to know the weight of the weights along with the clamp that is serving as another weight.
In conclusion, the polymer with the most stretchability is Polymer B in T1 and T2 polymer B had the highest number of mm out of the other polymers. There for it stretched the greatest amount. In the future I think it would be helpful for the students to record how much weight they used to test each polymer. I also think it would be beneficia to test more trials to be confident in the results.
a) Plastic type B is more stretchable than plastic type A,C,or D because in trial 1 plastic B stretched 22mm and it stretched 23mm. In both trials plastic type B stretched farther than the rest. a) The student could improve the experimental design by being specific with what 4 polymers she was using, the student could improve validity of her results by concluding even more trials than just 2.
(A) I concluded that plastic type B is the plastic with the best stretchability. ^P (B) One way the students could have improved the experiment is by doing more than two trials for each type of plastic. Another way the experiment could be improved is by doing trials with different amount of weights.
In conclusion some would strech alot and same wouldn't. They could improve it by adding more clamp or by streching it more.
A-In both trials plastic type b stretched the most. It stretched  22mm in trial one and 23mm in trial-one. ^p One way the students could have improved their experiment is have all the plastics the same length. Another thing could they could have done to put on the weights till it repeat.
Some of the students do like measuring but also like using the data table to find out the stretched amount is in the chart.
"One of the many conclusions that can be drawn from this piece of data is that plastic ""D"" stretched the most and plastic ""A"" stretched the low. Two ways to improve this experiment is one, to add more trials, and two, describe the amount of weighs being added to the clamp. Thus piece of info is crucial."
The two way the student could have improved the experimental design are why they put letters under plastic type is should be the type of plastic not A or B. My second way to improved the exeperimental design is the amount stretched (mm) is wrong because what is T1 and T2 where is the T3 if their three type of plastic.
(A) Plastic type B is the stretchable plastic than type A, C, and D. ^P (B) Two ways the student could have improved the experiment is to make sure that each piece of tape is the same length because it may affect the stretchability of the plastic. Another way to improve the experiment is to add the same amount of weight to each plastic type because it may affect the amount stretched.
Plastic type B is the polymer with the most stretchability. At the end of the experiment this is apparent because in both trials it stretched the most mm. Two ways to make the experiment better would be to leave the weights on for a longer period of time and also to add more weight on another was would be to make the experiment better would be to leave the heights on for a younger period of time and also to add more weight on. Another  way would be to use a double thickness of each material in evert trials.
The conclusion that I draw based on the student's data is that plastic A streched the most. Two ways that the students could have improved their experimental design and/or validity of their results would be to test all the materials at least three times and to and to allow the weights to hang longer than five minutes. Testing all materials three times improves the student validity, because it becomes more accurate. Allowing wieghts to hang longer make it easier to see which material streches the most.
a) After review of the results one can conclude that plastic type B as the most stretchable and durable this is because it had the highest mm stretch  distance for both trials.^p b) the student could have improved the results validity by performing 2 more trials after 2 minutes. By giving the plastics time to recover he can either test the durability over time.
Based on the students data, plastic type B stretched the most with 22 and 23 where as plastic type A stretched 10 and 12. ^p One way they could improve is as by making the size of the plastic constant. Another way thing could improve it is by making sure that when your letting it hang to stop it at exactly 5 minutes as you can keep the time constant too.
The students conclusion of this trial would be, plastic type 4 produced 10mm of streching for T1 and T2 produced 12mm so it increased by 2mm. Type B produced 12mm of strechability for T1 and 23mm for T2 for an increase of 1mm. type 3 produced 14mm of stretch ability for T1 and 13mm for T2 decreasing by 1mm. And lastly type D produced 20 mm of stretchability for T1 and 20 mm for T2. That's what a students conclusion would look like.
2A)Based on the data, its possible that he's hypothesis was right, because the data seams close to each other, so there's a higher possibility rigth than wrong.  ^p 3) The could have made more trials including a control varable (one that doesn't change ) Another way as by adding more weights but do the procedure a little bat different.
I have concluded that plastic B is the stretchiest and plastic A is the least stretchiest. A validity issue could have been leaving the weights on to long. Another validity issue could have been the measuring of the plastics was off.
A) Plastic type B stretched the most after five minutes stretching 22mm in trial 1 and 23mm in trial 2. The plastic type that stretched the least was type A. It stretched 10mm in trial 1 and 12mm in trial 2. In conclusion the strongest polymer is type B. ^P B) The first way the student could improve on the experiment in a whole is tell what type of plastics were each. He also could tell how much weight was added during the trials.
A. The plastic type B could stretch the longest at 22 and 23mm. Also the plastic type D is the only plastic that had the same length of 20mm for both trials. ^p B. Make a control having the clamp (without weight) be measured. Also they could've repeated the experiment by daily one more trial.
a) Based on the students data, I can conclude that the amount each plastic type stretched at consistent rate during both trials. ^p b) The student could have improved the experimental design by specifying how much weight was being added to the plastic samples. They could've the validity of the experiment by trying different amounts of weight with each plastic sample.
A. based on the results, I can conclude that plastic B stretched the farthest. In trials one and 2 it beat all others by at least a margin of two millimeters. B. One improvement they could've made is to any say length of each piece and make sure they were all equal. Another improvement could've been  to tell us the type of plastic for re-creature of the experiment.
A conclusion based on the data is plastic type B is the longest stretching plastic used. Two ways they could have improved their experimental design / validity of their results by hanging the plastic sample in a different place, and by cutting all the plastic samples the same length because that was not stated in the procedure.
I conclude that plastics A and C are a little stronger plastics than B and D because the both A and C stretched less than B and D. ^p Maybe 1 way to improve this is maybe wait a little longer until recording restarts because you might get a more interesting result. Another way to improve the validity of the answer to maybe test another time will get a third result making the answers more valid and presentable.
a) A conclusion that could be drawn on their data is that on the plastic types C for T1 pool more than T2 and for plastic tyre D T1 and T2 had the same amount of stretched (mm). ^p b) They could have tested their experement out longer and they could have used more interesting materials.
A) Plastic A & B stretched down the same. Plastic C was not that stretched down at all. B.) Two ways the students could have improved their experiment would be to measure the plastic type before stretched down. They should have had tested the plastic in different times. For example. T1 in 5 mins, T2 in 10 mins, trial 3 15mins, etc until 30 mins.
Plastic types B, D are more stretchable than A, C. ^P They could do more trials and add more weights.
a.) Based on the students data plastic type B stretched the farthest and therefor has the most stretchability. The one with the least stretchability was plastic type A. b.) One way the validity of the results could have done more trials. Another way the test could have been improved is by stretching the plastics by hand untill they break.
If the students test out the four different plastic stretchability then add weights to the clamps on the bottom of the plastic and wait 5 minutes, they will come to the conclution that plastic that plastic B is the most stretchable plastic B's results the first time was 22 $ the second time 23. The second most stretchable is plastic D which was 20 then 20. So in closing the students found if they put weights on the 4 different type of plastic and wait 5 minutes then repeat that, plastic B is the most stretchable.
(A) Based on the student's data, I can concluded that the plastic type A stretched the least with 10mm and 12mm. Plastic type B stretched the most with 22mm and 23mm. ^p (B) One way that the student could've improved the validity is to add more trials. Having at least 3 trials would have made this experiment more valid. Also, adding more time intervals instead of just one for five minutes would have improved this experiment.
a. Based on the student's result, it can be concluded that plastic B is the most stretchable because it stretched an average of 22.5 mm in 5 minutes. Plastic A is the least stretchable because it stretched only 11 mm in 5 minutes on average. ^p b. 1. The student should have specified the amount of weight added to the clamp and possibly performed more trials at different weights. 2. The student should have performed a third trial to obtain more consistent and dependable results.
On for in coud wont up on bown 14-13 on C the investigation be not be what A and B be. ^p A& D in not good two D bon't go up or bown so C and D is not good for the investigation.
A) My conclusion from this expiriment is that plastic type A is flexible. B is somewhat flexible, C as well and type D isn't flexible at all. ^p B) The students could improve by being more detailed in things, like the weight of the clamp itself & including a control of each plastic.
The conclustion of this lab according to the students, data type B of the plastic is the weakest and type A of the plastic is the strongest. For the plastic C and D, they are inbetween and C is close to A. The student could have improved the experiment by; saying the measurement of the plastic and how much mass the was on earth peice of plastic. Another way to improve the experiment is making sure the temperature is kept constant and that no one touches the plastic.
The experiment was very precise and contained multiple trials that proved to be similar to the previous one. Plastic type B appears to have stretched the farthest but it is impossible to tell seeing there are no starting lengths. The plastics as well as the weights should have been the exact same size.
A. Based on this students data, I can come to a conclusion that plastic type B was the most streched. ^p B. Two ways the student could have improved is by recording the length of the plastic before stretching. Also the student should have tested it three times instead of two.
The table characteristic property we formulate in the table because 10 +12=22 and amount stretched (mm) T1 = total is 44 and T2=600 the total att ch 9 clamp to the bottom plastic sample.
In this experiment I can conclude that plastic type B was the plastic that was  capable stretching the most. I can tell that plastic type A was the least able to stretch the most compared to other ones. Students can improve the design by having a control so that  they could compare aresults and makes experiment reliable. Also, in the procedure they should tell you how long the plastic should measure, how long the length should be.
"a) Plastic type/polymer ""B"" had the best stretchability out of the other polymer plastics. The data shows that in ""B""s both trials it stretched 22 and 23 mm farthest than any other plastic. ^p b) Two ways to improve the design are by doing more trials to be more accurate and by stating the amount of weight put on each bag (the same amount of weight)."
According to the data table plastic type B is the plastic that stretched the most without ripping. One way that the student could improve is in the procedure when it says add weights she should tell how heavy should the weights be. Also, she should tell what plastics were used.
a. Based on the data on the table, I can conclude that plastic B was the stretchiest followed by plastic D, C, then A. His results also seem precise because he did two trials and they were totally close to each other every time.  ^p b.  In the procedure, the student should have made each plastic sample the same size keeping it a constant variable. They also should explained how much weight to put on the clamps as it was omitted in the procedure.
a) Based on the data plastic type ''B'' is able to stretch out the best compared to all other the differant plastic types. ^p b) One way the students could have improved the experiment would be increasing the amount of trials. ^p Another way to improve the experiment would be to increase the amount of minutes it's left hanging. For example from 5 minutes to 10 minutes.
The conclusion can be made that the plastic type B has the greatest stretchability because in both trials, is stretched the greatest number of mm in comparison to the other 3 plastic types. the student should have conducted at least 1 more trial to validate the experiment since 3 trials are necessary. For a valid experiment would impact the stretchability more tests and constants would make the results more reliable.
a) You can see the trails were accurate to eachother plastic B stretched the least (with the average 11mm).^p b) the student could have improved the expierement by including the ongional measure of the plastic. They could have made the results more valid by keeping the weights on longer so there would be more variation between each result.
This investigation shows that plastic B stretched the most but or are the plastics used in this experiment. ^P One way the investigation could be to add more trials, second, if they added more time then maybe the outcome would have changed.
I can conclude that in trial 2 had a small impact on trial 1. The students could of improved adding the at same amount of weight to both type of plastics and keep that weights longer.
a. Plastic B, C are almost similar but plastic D stretched the most. ^p b. Two ways they can improve experiment was by adding a 3rd trial and also adding different times.
They could of improved it by putting their weight on them the same time and put the same amount of weight and had tried the object more than 2 times.
Plastic Type C stretched the most in both of its trials and plastic Type A stretched the least in both of the trials. The students could have allowed the plastics to long longer than 5 minutes, incase it takes some plastics longer to stretch. The students also could have used plastics that all had the same length to begin with, to eliminate all chances of error.
Plastic type A and B increased on the second trial while plastic type C decreased by 1mm and plastic type D stayed the same mm both trials. ^p The students could have improved the design by conducting another trial to get accurate results. The students could have been specific on the weight of the weights. For example, add 1 pound weights to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes.
The student could do better by describing it more how she did it and what she did, Add, subtracting, multiply, divide or something.
a Based off the information given plastic type B stretched the most, the type D, type C, type A. ^p B. Place more weight & let it hang longer or less.
Plastic D didn't change and plastic A stretched more in trial 2. Basically most of the plastics change but not all of them. ^p One way is making each plastic the same length before the experiment. A second way is use the same amount of tape for each plastic type.
According to the student's data, the plastic that streched the most was plastic type D and the one that streched the least was plastic type A. ^p I think that this experiment could have been improved by instead of having a second trial, you should have added more time.
From the data given to me, I can draw the conclusion that plastic type A is the least stretchable of the plastics probably because of it's tight bonding. Plastic D on the other hand is the most strechable of the polymers (loose bonding). One way the student could have improved his results could have been a 3rd trial that would improve the validity. A second way to improve the validity of this experiment would be to ensure one self to have the same length plastic and time the experiment.
a) Plastic type B is the stretchiest plastic. In T1 it  Stretched 22 mm, and in T2 it stretched 23mm. The least stretched plastic was type A. In T1, A stretched 10mm and in T2 it stretched 12mm. Type D was second stretchiest and type C was behind D. ^p b) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design/validity of the experiment is having a specific size of the original piece of plastic to stretch, and having a specific weight of the weight stretching the plastic. Constant keep the results of experiment valid.
One conclusion I made is that everytime in trial 2 it goes farther than in trial 1 the numbers increase. Two ways the student have improved on their experiment is by is by being more specific in their procedure and by adding a trial 3.
2.)At the end of the experiment i have concluded that plastic B had the best stretchability because in 1 and 2 it reached 22 mm the first time and 23 mm the second time. My hypothesis was also wrong because I had predicted plastic A would have the most stretchability but it didn't.^p (b)1.Put something heavier then weights. (2)Attach something other then a clamp.
A) My conclusion based on the student's data is that T2 A-B held a stronger than for T1; C for T1 was the one more mm than T2 but both trials seemed out for plastic type D. ^p B) Two ways those students could have improved is if they kept the plastic the same size and shape. And if they let hang for a min longer.
a. Out of all the plastic, plastic A is the stretchiest. Based on the data, it stretches 2 mm while the others stretched 1 mm or 0 mm. ^p b. To improve the experiment, the student could have used plastics that were all the same length to begin with. The student also, should've verified the weight of the weights they used and made alls they used the same weight throughout.
A) In conclusion, plastic B had the most stretchability. ^p B) One way the student could have improved this experiment could be to start with the same length of plastic for each trial & each plastic. The second way I would change the experiment would be to use a stop watch & be very presice about the time.
A.) The conclusion I have drawn about the students data table is that plastics A and B where stretchable. While C actually decrease in size and D did not stretch at all. ^P B.) Two ways that the student could improve this experiment is by naming the different plastics so you know your not looking the same kind of plastic that then once. Also to add more trials because they only held two.
Plastic type B was the most strechably polymer. The student could have conducted more trails and tell us how much the weights weigh.
Based on the student's data, you can conclude that plastic A streched the most. One way the student could have improved the experiment could be to have all of the plastics be the same size at the start of the experiment. Another way they could improve the experiment is to add a specific amount of weights in the clamp and have it be the same weight for each plastic.
a) Plastic type B is the stretchiest based on their data. ^p b) It could have be improved by using plastics of the same length. He also could have taken different lengths of the same plastic.
Plastic type A was the stretchiest. The student could have improved the validity of the results by doing more trials in the investigation, and by measuring the plastic prior to the experiment.
a) Plastic B has the most stretchability. If you take the average of the two trials plastic B, 22.5 mm, is higher then plastic A, 11mm, plastic C, 13.5mm, and plastic D, 10mm. ^p b) One way the students could have improved the experiment is by giving a specific amount of weight to add to each clamp. Another improvement would be to do third trial because this could increase the validity.
a. My conclusion would be that the plastic type B would be better because it stretched more. ^p b. One way the could have improved there experiment design would have been leaving on e of the plastic bags, with the weights the whole time ( control) types of plastic bags.
Two ways tat the student could have improved was to let the weights hang there for a little more time. Also use the same length of plastic for each trial.
A) Plastic type B is the one that has the most length. ^P B) The student could had put the plastic info equal pieces and, add the same amount of weights to the bags.
a) Plastic type B stretched the most, and plastic type A stretched the least. ^p b) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design are to specify the starting length of the plastic samples, and to specify the amount of weight added to each clamp.
A. Plastic type A is the most durable plastic because in trial 1 it only stretched 10mm and in trial 2 it stretched 12mm, which was the least amount of stretching. Plastic type B is the most durable type of plastic because in trial 1 it stretched 22mm and in trial 2 it stretched 23mm, which was the most amount of stretching. The students could have improved their experimental design by stating how much weight they used for each trial because nobody knows how much weight they were using for each trial. Secondly instead of adding weight to the clamp, the should have just put the weight onto the plastic itself to get maximum stretch.
Plastic sample C seems to be the least stretchy plastic because after testing it contracted. ^p 1. Keep plastic sizes constant for each experiment. ^p 2. Determine amount of weights added to the plastics from the clamp.
Two ways they could've improved there expirament, would be that they couldve let the weights hang on the plastic for a little but longer, and that they shouldve used different types of bags. The conclusion was that plastic type B stretched the most out of all the other bags.
Maybe he use the clamp to attach it before he add in the agredienta.
Based on the data, one can conclude that polymer B is the stretchiest and polymer A is the least stretchy. One way that the students could have improved the experiment is by repeating the test with different amounts of weight that way several stretchability of the bags could be tested. Also, the students could have conducted more trials. The more trials there are the lower to the rise of error or accident.
The conclusion is that in trials the student conducted it seems that in T2, the plastic stretched more than trial one. The student could change the experiment by telling you how much weight she put on each clamp. She could have taken away the second trial.
a) My conclusion is that plastic B was the most stretchable plastic. It stretched out between 22-23 mm in the two trials. ^p b) The student could have stated how many weights he/she added. He/she also could have recorded the original lengths of each of the plastics he/she was measuring.
In conclusion, plastic type B stretched the farthest with a measurement of 22mm for thal 1and a measurement of 23mm for trial 2. ^p They could have done more trials or let the clamp hang on the different plastics for a longer amount of time.
a The conclusion is that one were smaller the another one large and in the end they both equal^p b- One way to improved is experimental design is if they change the weights. Another way to improve this experiment if they try more trail there going to be better.
A conclusion based on this experiment is plastic B was the most stretched to 22mm, then on the second trial A stretched 23mm. On the other hand plastic A, C and D was lower than 22 and 23mm both times.
"Out of all the four plastics, type B stretched the most. One way the student could have improved was to mention that there are four types of plastics rather than are in, step one. Another way the student could have improved was to make his/her data table more clear and accurate by adding a ""time attached"" column."
a) Based on the data, you can conclude that polymer B had the most stretchability because it stretched the most trial one (22mm) and trial two (23mm). ^p b) To incate the validity of the experiment, the student could have include the amount of weight that was added to the clamp. This ways it would be added that the amount of weight was kept constant. The student also could have recorded two additional trials with more weights added.
A.The average amount stretched for plastic type B was the most while the average amount stretched for plastic type A was the least^p B.The experiment could have been improved by both. Increasing the number of trials for every time the lab is conducted .increasing the number of times the lab is conducted.
a)In conclusion plastic type B is stretchier that the other plastics. Type B stretched the farthest thant the others in that 5 minute period. ^p B) The students could have let the plastics be stretched untill they broke to see which one was really the stretchiest and should have added the exact same weight for all the plastic types.
Based on the data recieved plastic type c has streched the most compared to the other 3 plastic type C streched 22 mm for trial one and  23 mm for trial two. In both trial one and two plastic type C stretched the most. ^p One way they student can improve the validity of their results is by adding a third trial. Also, you can measure each type of plastic to be the same exact size, length, and width. By doing this it will make sure that the size of the plastic doesn't affect how much it streches.
"A0 I conclude that plastic type ""B"" has the highest amount of stretchability. Plastic B is able to stretch from 22 to 23mm. I can also conclude plastic ""A"" has the lowest stretchability at 10 to 12mm. ^p B) One way to make the investigation more valid is by having the length of each type of plastic be the same. Also the students need to make sure the plastic was taped the same way with the same tape. The students also need to use the same table for all four plastics."
To improve this experiment the student should have mentioned the 4 different types of plastic if mentioned, it would give a more accurate reason as why one type of plastic is more/less stretchable than the other. Also, what the different plastics are made off. If we know that it may help us know why that plastic is, or is not more stretchy from another type of plastic.
A) The plastics stretch about the same amount in Trial 1 and Trial 2 but the 4 plastics amount of stretch differs greatly. ^p B) The students could have done another trial or change the experiment up a little bit.
Plastic B is stretchiest.^p Used a control and ran more than 2 trials.
a) based on the students data trial 2 had a greater amount of stretch remained the same number of 30min in both trials. B) The student could have improved the experiment by adding 2 trial 3 to ensure accuracy. Another way the student could have improved the validity of the experiments was to record the amount of weights added to the clamp in step 4.
a)  Based on the data, both trials have the same stretchability. ^p b) The students could have stretched both plastics at the sametime. Also record how heavy, the clamps are.
According to the student's data plastic type B was able to stretch the longest with 23mm. Type D was close with 20mm but types C and A were for less stretchy with 14mm and 12mm respectively. The student should have specified how long the plastic sample should be eat. The student should have also specified how much weight was added to the clamps. For all I know, he would have used random lengths and weights for each trial so he should have been clearer in the procedure.
"Based on the students data, plastic type B stretched the most. However, the student could have improved the experimental design and validity of these results. First off, Their should be a required standard length for each type of plastic the directions could be like. ""step 1"" cut a 2omm strip of each plastic"". Also, this experiment should specify the amount of weight placed on the clamp and this exact amount should be repeated throughout the rest of the experiment."
A) From the table shown you can conclude that plastic type B in this investigation could stretch the farthest meaning it is the strongest of all the dffent types because it stretched 22mm and 23mm. ^P B) 1) Could have said how much weight to start with each time putting diffent stress levels on the plastics. 2) Told how long to keep the weight on beforeadding on more because this could cause a change in strength or stretchability.
Based on the students data I can conclude that plastic B stretches the most out of all the plastics. ^p b.) two ways the students could have improved this experiment is by being specific about the length of each piece of plastic. Another way they could have improved the experiment is by repeating the experiment.
a) The plastic did in fact stretch only in to 23 mm ^p b) The student could have used more weights on the second trial, or maybe on the second trial let it beng longer.
Based on the students data, we could see that plastic Type B was the polymer that stretched the most for both trials, they had a longer length than all of the others of 22mm and23mm. One way the student could have improved the experimental design could have been to note on the graph how long the polymer was before it was stretched.
The plastic type D is stretched the same amount in both trials. One thing they could of improved on is they should have have 3 trials not just 2.
(A) Based on the data shown in the experiment plastic B had the most stretchability and plastic A had the least stretchability. ^p (B) They could have improved their experiment by 1. starting out with the amount of weight for each plastic and 2. They could have performed one more trial to make sure their results were correct.
If we streched 4 different types of plastics, then the second plastic (plastic D) would strech the farthest. ^p Two ways the students could improve the experimental design and for validity of the results are naming the plastics to know which one is which so the data will not get mixed up. Also doing more than 2 trials. Another trial might helped the data.
Well they improved by making the right design and following the right instructions.
Based on the results shown, plastic B has the highest stretchability. After adding weight to the plastic for 5 minutes it showed that plastic B streched the most, 22 and 23 mm. Next in high stretchability comes D, C then A. Even though this experiment was good there are two ways to improve the experimental design. I think they should have tested how different weights effected each type of plastic. I also believe that there should be a controlled group, one with no weight to compare the results of adding the weights.
(A) I think that the plastic type A was the strongest because it stretched down the least. Plastic type B was least strongest because it went down the most. ^p (B) The student could included more trials to add validity. The student could have also included how much weight was being added to the plastic.
You can came to a conclusion that plastic type B was the most stretchable for trial one it got 22mm and for trialz it got 25mm compared to the others that only got in the teens but 0 got 20mm both trials.
Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic type A is the most durable.^p Two ways the student could have improved this experiment would be to clearify how much weight was added to each plastic and to measure the plastic before he/she stretched it.
a.) Polymer B has a higher streethability cuts that all the other plastics tested. ^p b.) The students can able more trials to their experiments. Also, they can clarity what type of plastic tins being used.
a. Plastic type B was the stretchiest, while A stretched the least. ^p b 1.) Make sure the plastics were all the same length. ^p 2.) Measure the plastics during the process of stretching.
Plastic A + B stayed stretched from the T1 and then streched more in T2. C went down so it probably gets shorter as you wear it out I guess. D stayed the same. ^p They should of added the amount of weight the attached to each plastic. They should of said how much the clamp weighed.
A conclusion made from the students data is that different plastics' length are affected by wieght in their own ways; staying the same , growing , or shortening. The students could have been more specific by writing down how long each plastic has originally before the the 2 trials. They also could have been more detailed about how much weight ,they were adding to the plastic.
"A- In conclusion, plastic type ""B"" streched the most. The data says, it streched 22mm on trial one and 23mm on trial 2. ^p B- One way the student could change the procedure, is allow them to hang for 10 min instead of 5 minutes. Also they could change it up by, changing the weights every time."
a) Based on the data shown on the table, I would say that plastic type B has the most amount stretched. ^P b) The first way is would of presented the result better and have more trails. Second it says allow them to hang fro five mins it should ve been 10-15 mins, 5mins does nothing.
A. Plastic A is stretched the bigest throughout the experiment while plastic D shoved no change B. ^p The student could have improved the validity by adding more traits because the plastic. would have stretched larger if there were more trials and also add constants because if more things are the same throughout the experiment then the results would be more valid.
According to the data provided, this experiment had roughly the same outcomes in trial 1 and trial 2. It's either one number higher or lower in trial 2. But, there're two ways that this experiment could be improved. One, explain what type of plastics are being stretched. Two, say how much weight is going to be added to the clamps.
A. Plastic B stretched the most. Plastic A was the strongest out of all. ^p B. They should have added more weights to see which would have stretched the most and which would be stronger.
Based on the result of the experiments we can conclude that plastic type B has the greatest elasticity of the four plastics. One way the students could have improved on their experiments is to run a third test. Adding another test should show they would get result similar too the first two tests.
a) Concluding from the students data, plastic type A is the strongest plastic C is the least strongest, is the third, and b is the least durable. b) The student could have improved this experiment is by doing at least one more trial. They could have made a cooled and warmly the dependent/ independent variables to ran to this experimental design are vareid.
a) In conclusion the plastic type B stretched the most in both trials. It's the stretchiest. ^p b) The student could of stretched it by two students holding both sides and simply pulling with weights on it. They could of repeated the procedure one more time. They should of had a control grap.
"A) A conclusion that I have concluded from the data table is: plastic type ""B and D"" were stretched the most leaving type ""A and C"" being the most durable types of plastic.^p B) Two ways that the students could have improved there experiment design/ or validity are: more trials for more accuracy. And more plastic types to experiment with to actually find out which one is the most durable."
A) My conclusion based on the students data is that plastic type A is the one that stretches the most. ^p B) Two things the student could of did to make his experiment better is, one tell us how much the weights weighed and two tell us the plastic types of polymer be used.
I conclude that plastic type B would be the best plastic for stretchability, because in both trials plastic B is the one that stretched the farthest. In trial 1 it stretched 22mm, and trial 2 it streached 23mm. The student could have improved the validity by giving specific measurements for size of plastic so leure are all equal. The student also could have sold to use the  plastics when they were all the same day the agesa that are isn't older or weaver than another plastic.
(A) Based on the students data a good conclusion to make is that plastic B was the strongest. ^p (B) Some ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be they should of said how much the weight weighed. Also they could of done more trials to make the experiment more valid. Also how much did the clamp weigh to make it more accurate results.
a) I conclude that plastic B has the highest tensile strength. B) They could have said how much weight to add. As well as add a different amount of weight for the second trial (preferrably a higher amount).
polymer A is a more hard and less maliable plastic which would been it would be like a 1 on 3 plastic D is really maliable and stretch so it would be a politer polymer. They could improve on the design. By may be using, more weight so they get more stretch and see its limits and way it  stretches because so polymers stretch in different directions. They would do one more trial to get more data and make it more valid.
A. Based on the students date, I can conclude that plastic type B is the most flexible at all the samples. ^p B. To improve their experimental design, the students could have added more trials and also specified how much weight to add.
My conclusion is that plastic type A has the least stretchability and plastic type B has the most stretchability compared to both trials. One way to have improved the experiment design would have been to add weights and let them hang foe ten minutes for the second trial and perform more trials with longer times with weights on the plastic.
The student could say how much weight he used. Also increase the weight in the second trial. They should also perform the trial atleast 3 times to increase the validity of the results the students must also increase the time of hanging process.
The measures of every plastic should be the same to start. Secondly, there should be a precise amount of weights being added. My conclusion is that type B stretched the most. It was easily the longest.
The student can conclude that polymer plastic B is the most strechability because it has the longest length in both trials.Two ways this experiment could  have been better is by saying how much weight to add to each plastic polymer and second by repeting the experiment more than twice.
I conclude that plastic type B stretched the most. One way the students could have improved the  experiment design and / or validity of the results is to make sure all the plastic types start out at the same length. Another way is to have a certain amount of weights for all the plastic type trials.
a) No conclusion can be drawn from this experiment because the length of the plastic before the weights are added we not listed. Therefore you can no see wich plastic stretched the farthest. ^p b) Two was they can improve the valitity of this experiment are 1. list the length of the plastic before its stretched and 2. state how much the weight weigh and if they all the same.
(a) Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic type B was the most stretchable. This is because it was stretched more than the other plastic after 5 minutes in both trials for example, plastic B stretched 22 mm in the first trial but plastic D the next most stretchable only stretched 20 mm. The students could have improved the experiment adding more trials. This would make their experiment more accurate because they will have more both to use their by. They should have also tell how many weights to add at a time, so that they, and whoever else does this experiment remains constant.
Based on the student's data, the trials for each of the different plastics were very similar and showed no significant chang in how much the plastic stretched. Two ways to be more specific on exactly how much weight is to be added to the clamp. Also the student should include how big each plastic sample should be, because if they used four different size samples the results would be inaccurate.
Plastic type B stretas the furthet out of the other three what happens to plastic. When i get low to the ground. How much weight do they put to the end of these plastic.
A) Plastic type B has the most stretchability out of them all. Type D has the second most type C has the third mast and type A has the least. ^p B) One way the experiamental design could be improved is by saying how much the weights weigh. Also, it would have been better if they averaged both trials together also.
2 Plastic type B can stretch the most without bearing to.  The students could have conducted more trials (which could have improved the experimental design and validity). The students also should have specified the weights of each weights and the clamp so if someones were to repeat the experiment, they would known how much weight to add.
a) The percentage of the amount the plastic stretched was alot lower in the second trial than in the first. ^p b) They could have done more trials. They could have used more polymer plastics.
"Plastic type ""B"" has the most stretchability after trials 1 and 2."
I drew a conclusion based on the students data that plastic type B stretched out the most in mm for both trial one and trial turn. One way the students could have improved their experimental design is that they could've informed us what type of plastics were being tested like; garbage bag, freezer bag and sandwhich bag. Another way the students could've improved their experiments by how many weights did they put in for each plastic bag they stretched out.
Based on the students data you can conclude that plastic B is more durable than the rest of the plastics tested. Also that plastic A was the least durable out of the plastics. One way the students could improve their experiment is if they have at least 3 trials instead of just 2. Another thing the group could do to improve their experiment is to identify the independent and dependent variables in their procedure.
A. My conclusion to the polymet investigation is that plastic be is more likely to stretch the longest in five minutes. ^p B. They experiment could had been improved if they added more trials to show consistency  or change in the experiment. Another way to give a  hypothesis to show if you predicted wright or wrong.
a) Based on the data given, I can see that plastic A is the strongest polymer and doesn't have much stretchability. ^P b) To validate her results, I think the student should have put how long the plastic was originally and how many millimeters long it was after the weights to see the actual data for ourselves. The student could tested the plastic a third time to improve her experiment.
A. To conclude, polymer plastic B has the higest strech in meters. ^P B. Add different weights. ^P See which is more durable or stonger. ^P Clamp each differently.
A conclusion that can be drawn is that plastic type B is the most flexible plastic and can stretch the farthest. The student could have improved their experiment by stating how heavy the weights were that were attached to the clamp. Right now, one can only guess what weight that was. Another way the student could have improved their experiment is by stating the original length of all the plastics, cutting them all to a certain length would improve the validity of the experiment because it would show plastic B actually stretched the farthest and did not just showed off changes.
From the data given, I conclude that plastic B had the most strech ability and plastic A had the least. Two ways this experiments could be improved is by using the same size plastic for each type of plastic and by stating how many  he used.
a) Two out of the four plastic types lengths increased. ^p b) First  the students should have more trials and allow the weights to hang more than five minutes on to the clamp.
In each trial (both 1 and 2) the amount stretched increased steadily and ended at the same amount. Two ways the student's could have improved there experiment was by saying how much weight to put on the clamps. Another way to improve the experiment was, to say how far, would they have wanted the weight and clamps to be (far down or far up).
A) Plastic sample B was the stretchiest because it's greatest length was 23mm. ^p B) They should have measured the length of the plastic before they stretched it so we can know how much it stretched. They also should have run more than two trials so we can be absolutely sure of their results.
a. Based on only the data shown one can conclude that plastic the most stretchability out of all the plastic tested because it stretched the most during the experiment one can also assume that plastic type A has the least stretchability because it stretched the least during the experiment. One way that the experimental design could have been improved, is to have controlled the original lengths of all the plastics and make them equal. Another way to have improved the experimental design is to have included the exact weight that was being applied to the plastic.
A. Some plastics are more strichy or maybe some of them are harder than the other brands.^p B. They could of put the time period a little longer. Also for T2 they could of put more weight than T1.
A)In conclusion, plastic type B has stretched the most probably not the most dependable material. The best plastic type would be A. Plastic type A can withstand the most support of weight in the bag so you don't have to worry about it ripping. ^p B) These students should have conducted a third trial. It would have made for finding a better average of stretching on the plastic type. Also explain how much weight was stretching these plastic bags.
The conclusion that I have drawn is that plastic type D streached the most which makes it more durable than the rest. Two ways he could have improved was by telling us how much weught was added and by telling us he averaged out the three plastic samples strechness.
a) The total amount of T2 is greater than T1. ^p b) All lengths should be the same and every step should be equal to the others.
From the students data from conclude that type D is most stretch able and that type A is the least stretchable. This lab couldn't been improved by saying to record the measurements in steps 7 & 5. Also by taking what until to measure with, in steps 7 & 5.
The number incress for T2 most of the time. ^P Do another trial.
A) From the table results for the experiment, you can conclude that type B was the most stretchable out plastic and type A was the strongest at holding together, the polymers and cross linking made it strong. ^p B) She could have improved the experiment by allow more trials and making sure the plastic samples were the same size and length.
a) The polymer plastic withe biggest stretchability was type B because it stretched over 22mm. b) The students should have measured the amount of mm the plastic stretch while the clamps were still on. Also the students should have used plastics of all the same length.
a) In conclusion, different polymer plastics do have different stretchabilities, some polymers, such as B and D , are much more stretchable than polymers such as A and C.^P b) The student could have improved this experiment by specifying the amount of weight used, and how far to let them hang. Also, the student should have specified how to calculate the amount of polymer stretched.
a) In conclusion plastic type B in trial 1 and trial 2 stretched more then plactic type A, C, and D.^p b) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design or validity of the results are they could of tested more times to get better results, and they could of let the weights stay in the bag a bit longer before removing them.
It has been confirmed accordind to the data in the table, that plastic type B can be streched out the longest compared to plastic types A,C and D. Plastic type B reached length of 23mm which is the highest length measure in the table. Two ways the student can improve there design / or validity of their results is by collecting more data and creating more trials to get a more accurate result.
Based on the student's data, plastic type D stretched the most for both trials so that would be the one to choose when looking for the most stretchable. The first way the student could have improved the experiment is by doing a third trial. The second way the student could have improved the experimental design is by making sure all the clamps and weights are the same and are hanging for exactly the same amount of time.
a) When stretched plastic B seemed to be weakest and stretch the most as where plastic A seemed strongest. ^p One way is to have equal size plastics to start with. Another way is to say exactly how much weight needed to  be added to each,
The conclusion that can be drawn from the data done in that plastic type B. stretched the most, which was 21mm in T1 and 22mm in T2. One way the student could've improved the experiment is to add another trial. Also by using the same weight to weights.
"(a) Based on the student's data, plastic type b was more, flexible and susceptible to stretching. Plastic type A was most likely a harder or thicker type of plastic, making it more difficult to stretch. ^p (b) To improve the experiment and validity  of the results, the students could have run more than two trials so they had more to compare. They also could have included ""record results"" in their procedure."
My conclusion will be that with the added weight, the plastics stretched. ^p To make this trial more reliable the student should have stated how long and wide each plastic should be. The students should have also stated how much weight should be added to the plastic.
A: Based on the student's data, plastic B is the most stretchable polymer plastic and plastic A is the least stretchable. ^p B: One way the students could improve their experiment is to perform more than just two trials to ensure their data is valid. Another way they could improve their experimental design is to specify how it tape the plastics so as to make sure their are all taped and pulled the same way.
The student's data shows that the plastic types are stretchable. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is by writing its first starting length and for another improvement they could have one a third trial to rest if their experiment is true.
The plastic that the most stretchability is plastic B, probably due to the fact that all of the polymer links are parallel to each other, and it stretched an average of 22-23mm. 2 ways that this could have been improved is having a 3rd trial, and using the same length for each sheet or plastic.
a.)Plastic type D was able to stretch farther, so based on that result I conclude it was able to withstand more weight.^p (b)Two ways the student could of improved the validity of the result are use the same size of plastic for all trials and types, and add another trial to combine results.
50% of the plastics stretched farther & the second time, 25& did worse the second time and a 5% did the same. ^p A third trial might help and explain what the if plastics were.
Plastic type B has the most stretchability. One way that this could have improved is if the students did another trial to make sure that their experiment was valid. Another thing the students want to do is make sure they have the same size of plastic to start with.
Is conclusion, plastic B stretched the most and plastic A stretched less. ^P The student could've retested a 3rd time and state wat he was trying the acomplizb
A, In this experiment the plastic B stretched the most because it went 23mm and A went 12mm and 13mm and D 20mm. B. They could have improved there experiment by doing more trials, and have the plastics of the same lenghth.
a)- A conclusion would be that plastic type A could withstand the most weights with out being stretched the most. ^p The first thing they could do to improve their experiment would be to use a specific # of weights and clamps. The second thing would be to increase the number of trials.
Based on the data collected from the experiment you can conclude that plastic type D stretched the most. Validity: The students did two trials and their results from the second tool were very similar to the first trial. One way the student could of improved the experiment is adding more weight to see if they could of stretched further. Another way to improve the experiment is by using more then one type of plastic.
a). Plastic D and plastic C are not that good. The two types that increased type A and B. ^p b). They should'nt have taped it to a table. There should have been 2 people holding it from both sides. Also I think they should have measured in inches.
Type A plastic stretched the most. ^p Attach the plastic to the side of the table in a more effective way, and provide the names of the plastics rather than giving them variables.
A conclusion I can draw from the data is that plastic type A had stretched more in T2 than the rest, the others were only one mm apart while plastic type A, had a difference of 2mm. One way the students can improve their experiment is by having the plastic the same length in the beginning and the second way is by adding how many weights it took so the plastic would stretch.
In conclusion, plastic type B stretched the most in both trials. ^p One way the student could have improved the validity is to cut each plastic to the same length. Another way to improve the experiment design is to specify how much weight to add to the clamp.
I would conclude that the plactic T2 to more strechy than T1. It could be improved quite a few way frist off it was never stated how much wight is being added or if it was the same each time or the fact that.
a.) The most stretchable polymer was polymer D, where it stretched 20 mm both trials (also making it the most reliable as it's stretchability didn't fluctuate). ^p b.) One way they could've improved the experiment is by specifying what the weight of the weights added to the clamp were (and how many) to ensure that all polymers were tested the exact same way. Second, they could have a third, or even fourth trial to their experiment to increase validity of the experiment.
The conclusion would be that the plastic in trial2 was stretchies for the most part trial 1. Two ways they could have improved this experiment would be to repeat the procedure with different plastic and put it at different temperatures.
Plastic type A stretched the least out of all 4 plastics, leading to a conclution that it has the worst stretchability of all 4 plastics. Plastic type B stretched the most for both trail test 1 & 2 enough info to conclude that B has the best stretchability. ^p The students could of improved their experiment by adding in the procedure exactly what was the weight of the weights they used and they could of performed a 3rd trail test to see if results were continues and never changing.
In this experiment students tested to see
a)According to the data shown, plastic type D has the most stretchability.^p (b)The student could have done more trials, made a line graph, and tested the plastics for different times.
Based on the students data the amount that has been stretched finally didn't make a difference because som when up by 1 and 2 and some just shod the same. One way the student could have improved their experiment design is telling us how many weights to add to the clamps.
After reading the data I have concluded that plastic type B is the stretches. One out of four types. I concluded that type b is the best because when you add up the numbers from T1& T2 for each number type B has 45mm. So it is the longest on.
a. The plastic that stretched the greatest has the plastic type B. Almost more than half the plastic types had stretched more the second trial. ^p b. This student should label the names of the plastic, not just, A-D.
The conclusion that can  be drawn,based on their data, is that that plastic type A was the  least stretchable and is the most durable and plastic type B is the most strechable and the least durable. One way they could've improved their experiment is to have each plastic type have the same amount of length for each piece because that could affect the stretchability of each plastic. Another improvement could be that they could've specified how much plastic should be hanging from the table so each plastic has same amount of length.
A. In conclusion Plastic B was the best because it had the highest amount stretched for both trials in the first it stretched 22 while A,10, C 14, D 20 the second trial that it went up a mm to 23 while A,12,C,13, D 20. ^p One way they could improve the validity is more trials your experiment will only get more valid with more trials. The second way is to be more specific with what trials with what kind of tape, how much tape your using and were you measuring from weather it's the whole thing or just the part hanging.
A) In conclusion, my hypothesis was right. The plastic ended up ripping due to the fact that the weight was hanging on it. The independent variable was the plastic and the dependent variable was the weight.^p B) The students could have improved the experimental design by having the weight the same for every trial. Also there should have been more than two trials.
I conclude that plastic type D was able to stretch themost out of all of the plastics. The two things these students would have done to improve ther validity and experimental design is they could have used more trials and they also could have used a control
Plastic type A was the strongest. The student could have made it before and after instead of Trial 1 and Trial 2. They also could have named the different type of plastics.
A conclusion that can be drawn from the students' polymer investigation would be that plastic type A was the strongest plastic used. It took the least amount of stretches although it had gained two stretches on the second trial. Two ways the students could have improved their experiment are that they could have increase the amount of plastic types and include more trials of testing the different plastics.
"The data provided concludes that plastic type ""B"" stretched the most. One way the student could improve the validity of this experiment would be to state the weight of the weights that are to be added onto the pieces of plastic. One thing the student also should have done was to have recorded the original lengths of the plastic samples so you could see just how much the pieces of plastic streched from their original lengths."
In conclusion, the students data table is base on that plastic type B in both trail had most streched. The students could have improve more if they add other trail and added on control.
For one the student could of use two wheights instead of one. And also use a diferent method for example instead of hanging the bowls from the table hang them up from a high place.
Plastic D has no stretchability. It stayed the same both trial kinds. ^P The students could of improved there experiment by putting a time for trial 2. Also giving an exact amount of weight that should be added to the plastic.
Based on the students data; plastic type B has the highest stretchability at 45mm stretched, while plastic type A would be the worst at only 22mm stretched. ^p Two ways the students could have improved their data are, one; They could say how heavy the weights were and maybe allowed them to hang on the clamps for more than 5 minutes. Two; They could have had more than 2 trials.
Based on the student's data I can tell that plastic type B was the most stretchable. I see this because in his results plastic B had the greatest amount in milimeters stretched. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and validity of the results was by giving the initial length of the plastics and each plastic should have had a constant length.
Conclusion, the tape has stretched more because of the weight level has a high level of density. To improve, they should make a bar graph.
a) A conclusion based on the student's data that I can draw is the Plastic all stayed around. The same amount stretched from T1 to T2 if any thing it was 1mm or 2mm of the first TI. ^P B) Two way the students could have improved the experiment design/or validity of the results was to do more than one way to stretch the bags, and to do 3 trails each.
To conclude, plastic type B stretched more in trial 2. It stretched 23mm, the plastic that least stretched was plastic type A. It only stretched 12mm for trial 2 and 10mm for trial 1. This means plastic B is the strongest and plastic A is the weakest, also plastic D stayed constant for trial 1 and 2.
A conclusion based on the student's data is plastic type B is the most amount stretched and plastic type A was the least amount stretched. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is be more informative on the size sample you must take. Also the amount of weights you add one.
In conclusion to the student's expirements, each plastic had stretched more or less the same amount of the first trial. Plastic B was the most stretchable. An improvement the students should have made was make each piece of plastic the same length before stretching. The students could have improved the validity by showing the length of the plastic before it was stretched to measure exactly which plastic stretched more.
The two ways the student could have improved experimental design out/or validity of the results are.Procedure:4) Add weights to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes.If you do that you doing to know plastics is stronge and can carry a havy thing. 5) Remove the weight and camp and measure the length of the plastic types. After you remove the weights and cound how many weight they can early stuff in the plastic.
A conclusion drawn is that the results were fully accurate and had little change during the second trial. The students could have included a diagram to give a better picture of how the experiment should look like and a good info and results have at least 3 trials. So the students should have done another trial and drawn a diagram.
Based on the student's data, plastic type B was consistently the stretchiest of all the plastic types used in the experiment. One possible validity issue is the description of the weights added to the clamp in each trial. The procedure does not tell in how much weight must be applied and thus a person may apply uneven amounts of weight dipending on the trial and plastic. This would cause the experiment to have the uniformity of its data in the fact that the weight was not constant. Also, the student could have improved the experimental design by adding more trials to the experiment and in turn gaining more data to make the results more accurate.
According to the data table it looks like the plastic type B was stretched the most and plastic A was stretched the best. B. One way the experiment could have improved is if they said what the measurement of the plastic was before the weights were on it. Another thing is they have said how much the weight was that hung on the plastic.
Based on the data  shown, plastic type 'D' seems to be the most durable. The table shows that it did not stretch. The student could have improved validity by doing more trials, and repeating the experiment more than once incase any error wes made during the first run through of the test.
The students could have improved their design/results by measuring the weight of the clamp without the weights attached and they could have done a third trial.
a) The conclusion is that plastic type A streched the least (11mm) compared to the other plastics. Plastic type B stretches the most (22.5). ^P b) Two ways that the student could have improved his experiment was to do at least three trials to get a more accurate results. Another way could have been streching the plastics for more than five minutes, to make the results more accurate.
A) The data from this investigation shows that the plastic stretched the furthest was type B Next was type D, then type C, and finally type A. The information shows they did two trails to make sure they have correct information.^p B) One way the student could have improved this experiment design was to make steps and to explain the procedure more. Next, I would say to make a graph would be the best way to further improve these results.
A conclusion based on the student's data would be that plasic D has the most stretchability. One way the student could have improved the experiment would have been to show the things kept constant. For example how much weights were used and how long has each piece of plastic. Another way the student could have improved would have been to include a control to compare to. For instance one plastic with no weight.
I think that plastic type B is the best because it stretched the farthest in both trials. ^p They should've been more specific with whic four types of plastics they should have used and they should have said exactly how many weights to put on it.
b. The student should use all sample plastics of the same length so the strength and stretchability can be determined. The student should have also done atleast one more trial to eliminate possible experimental error. ^p a. From the experiment, plastic type B came to be the most stretchable. Plastic type D was also very stretchable and the second stretchiest, plastic type C came after B, and after C, came plastic type A. Plastic A was the strongest but plastic B was the stretchiest.
A. In conclusion based on the students data, T1's plastics where a little bit weaker the T2's. ^p (B) One way a student could have im proved the experiment is by adding more length to the plastics. ^p Another way to improve the experiment is by trying more trials.
Based on the student's data, plastic B stretched the most with 22, and 23 mm in their trials respectively. However, the student cold've recorded the starting length and the difference in length, as from this data the reader doesn't know if these results are comparative. In the procedure, the first step is measuring the length, but i don't see that data. Another improvement wold be more trials.
a) The students conclusion is that although plastic D was the most accurate, plastic B stretched the most for both trials. ^p b) The procedure does not say the amount / what unit of weight was added. The plastics also must all be the same length.
One conclusion that can be based off the student's data is that plastic type B has the most stretchability out of all of the plastics tested.One way this student can improve the experimental design is to add more trials to the experiment. Another way is to set the length the plastic should be because having different plastic lengths can cause experimental error.
In conclusion, plastic B stretched the most (22 & 23 mm) and plastic A stretched the least (10 & 12 mm). ^p One way to help improve the experiment is to have a constant, which would be each plastic with out any weights. Another way to help improve this experiment is to specify how much weight should be added to the clamp.
a) Based on the students data plastic type B stretched the most. On the first trial plastic type B stretched 22mm while plastic C only stretched 14mm. On the second trial plastic B stretched 23mm and the next closes was plastic type D which stretched 20mm. ^P b) Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is to do more trials and when the students are starting the experiment tell me how long the plastic is before you start to stretch it.
Plastic type (A) stretched (2in) and plastic type (D) it didn't stretched at all.
The conclusion I have come to base off of the students data is that the most durable plastic strength base is (1). I know this to be true because there is no length difference between T1 & T2.
Plastic type A stretch 10 (mm) on the first trial and 12 on the second. Type B stretched 22 (mm) on the first and 23 on the second.  Type C stretched 14 (mm) on the first trial and 13 on the second.  Type D stretched 20 (mm) on the first trial and the same amount on the second. I can conclude that type B has the most stretchability because it stretched 22(mm) on the first trail and 23(mm) on the second trail. Two way to improve is to add a trail and try different amounts of weights.
A conclusion for this lab could be that plastic type B stretched the most because it is thin and that type A streched the least because it is the thickest. A way that the student could have improved is to name the different plastics. Also to say how much weight to the clamp.
Based on the student's data I can conclude that plastic type D is the strongest of them all, for both trials 1 and 2. I think they could have explained it more so that I could have a better mental image of it. I also think they should have said how much weight they added the the clamps.
a. Based on the students data you can tell the plastic did not stretch too much. most of the plastics ended up stretching 1-2 mm. For example, plastic a went from stretching at 10mm-12mm, on the other hand plastic C decreased 1mm and went from 14mm-13mm plastic D didn't stretch within both trials. ^p To improve their experiment the student could have recorded how long the bag was before weights were placed on them and they could have also said how much did the wights have to weigh in order to keep how much the bag stretched constant.
The conclusion I get on this students data is that all the plastics have been weighed and been measured. But as they did the 2trial the data changed and for plastic type D its weight and length was the same it means that it was hanged up last and they took it down too fast so it measures the same.
a)The conclusion that I could base is that plastic type B in both trials had stretched the longest.^p (b)Two ways that the students could have improved the experimental design is by letting us know how many weights put in each cup. Also the same length of each piece should be noted as well.
(A)My conclusion on the student data table is that plastic D was the strongest. It stretch up to 20 mm in both trials.^p (B)Two ways the student could have improve was to make a 3 trial or test and to be able to measure the abravasion of the plastic types.
After experimenting which plastic was more pliant, the conclusion was made that plastic type B was the most stretchable in, both, trial A and trial B. Two ways the student could have improved the experiment are changing step 7 and making it less vague and say specifically re do steps 1-6 for a second trial, etc. The student could be sure to time each trial for accurate validity.
The plastic type B has the most elasticity over all the other plastics. Plastic type A has the least amount of stretchability over the plastics. A way he could've improved this experiment is by overaging out both times he measured the elasticity. Another way he could've improval this is by trying out more times and then averaging those out.
It can be concluded that plastic B is the stretchiest because it had the highest average and much stretched of 22.5 mm. Two ways the students would have improved their experimental design are that they should've included how much weight. The weight was and how many clamps to use. Also, they should've used a control plastic to compare their results to.
One conclusion I ran make is plastic B was best of stretchability. And students could have made this expiriment better by making sure the plastics were the same starting size. Another way is they could have added another column to show at what sise the plastic was before the expiriment so that you can see how much the plastic stretched.
A. Polymer plastic B had the most stretchability of 23mm. 11mm more than plastic type A, 10mm more than plastic type c, 3mm more than the stretchability of plastic type D. By having more improved trials. They should have made sure all the plastic types had the same measure in length and width. and they could have tested more types of plastics.
(a) Based on the student's data, you can conclude that plastic type B is the most stretchable and plastic type A has the least stretchability. ^p (b) One way the student could improve is by making sure the plastic strips are all the same length+ hanging off the table from the same point. Another improvement would be to record the original length of each plastic strip. This would provide a constant to compare the results to.
This experiment didn't seem to work out very well. Judging by the data table, the experiment didn't seem to prove anything. There are no significant changes in the lengths of the plastics. The first three steps of the experiment are good, but rather than removing the weights, the student should just keep adding more and more weights until the plastic, finally stops. That would really show how much the plastic could stretch. Another way to improve the experiment is to conduct a third trial. An experiment is more, valid when there are more and more trials.
A.) Plastic type 2 had more stretchability then all the other plastics tested. ^p B>) The student could have improved the test by saying how much weights was added during the experiment. The student could have also discribed the rate at which to add the weights for consistancy.
I have concluded that plastic B stretched the most. It stretche about 23mm in all. ^p Name what plastics they were. Measure the plastic before you stretch it.
According to the data, plastic type B is the stretchiest plastic. It stretched 22mm in trial one, and 23 mm in trial 2. ^p One way the students could have improved the validity of the experiment would be to not just add weights to the plastic like in the procedure, but put the same amount of weight on the plastic each time. Another problem would be if the plastic wasn't taped at the same distance from the edge and if they are using a new set of the same plastic for their second trial.
Two ways the students could have improved the experiment design is to added different weights to see how much long the plastic could stretch until it trips. Another is to do more than two trial to make more reliable.
"a) Plastic type ""B"" has the greatest stretchability amoung the four types of plastic. In the first trial it stretched 20mm, and in the second trial it stretched 23mm. Plastic type ""A"" has the worst stretchability. In (T1) it stretched 10mm, and in (T2) it stretched 12mm.^p b.) Adding many more trials, and by adding more weight to the clamp, so that the plastic could stretch until it tears."
"a.) Based on the students data, plastic type ""B"" was the most stretchable of the tested plastic. ^P b.) One improvement would be keeping the starting length them same & stating it. Second would be the amount of weight attached at each intervals."
Based on the student's data it can be concluded that plastic type B has the best elasticity. The student could have improven the experiment by adding trials and specifying in the procedure how much weight is used.
Plastic type B has stretched the most and A the least. D has stayed the same for both trials while C has stretched less n during the second trial and A and B have stretched more. Two ways in which the experiment could be improved is to tell how much weight to add and tell what types of plastics were used in the results.
My conclusion based on the student data is that plastic typ D stretched the most and plastic type A stretched the least
Plastic type be was the most stretchable. Stretching on average of 22.5mm and plastic type A was the least stretchable, stretching an average of 11mm. The students could have improved the experimental design by specifying how much weight they attatched to each plastic and then keeping it constant. The way the procedure is written now we don't know if the amount of weight was used constant.
I can conclude that plastic C is the weakest out of all the plastics because it stretched the most. One way that the students could have improved the experiment is to do more than two trials in each plastic because two trials is not reliable enough. also, the students should have checked the length of the plastic at different time intervals, like every minute, so you could see how the plastic stretched over time.
Plastic type A is the strongest type and has the strongest polymers. Two ways in which the experiment could have been better is that the student could have added the weight of the clamps to this data and the student could have also added the table height.
A) I conclude that plastic A is the strongest because it stretched the least in both trials. ^P B) Two ways the student could have improved the experiment are doing another trial and including the length of the plastic, rerare adding the weights, in the results.
WSR
Type D stretched the same length in test one and two. They could have said what the starting measure of the plastic and how much the wieghts were.
It can be concluded that samples B and D had higher stretchability than samples A and C to improve the experiment design, the students could have clarified how many weights they were adding to the clamp because that should have remained constant could for accurate results. Also the student could have made it clear exactly where on the table the samples were being taped because, for example if one was an inch onto the table that would take an inch off the final results.
a.Plastic type B had stretched more than plastic type A in trials 1 and 2. In trial 1 plastic type B stretched 22mm, and in trial 2 it stretched 1 mm more.^p (b)The student could have put the temperature in the experiment because that could've been a cause of the amount stretched of plastic. the student could've as put the start of how much the plastic weighted in mm.
In this experiment, students tried to test the polymer plastics for strechability. In conclusion types A, B stretched at least one or two mm from its original length yet type C shrink and type D remained the same. One way the students could of improved their experiment is by adding how big or heavy the weights they used to stretch experiment is listing where they wanted the top of the plastic taped to the desk.
Based on these results plastic type B and D stretch the most but of the four plastics while plastics A and C sustain their shape much better. The student could have improved the design of this expiriment by setting on exact weight being added to the plastics and by completing one more trial to make a total of three trials.
a. Plastic B was the one with the most stretchability, plastic D came next followed by plastic C then A. ^p b. The student could have included how much the weights weighed. This would make the experiment valid when reproduced. ^p Also, they could have included the initial length of the plastic before it was stretched.
Based on the student's data, I can conclude that plastic B is more flexible. This is because for each trial, it stretched the most. On the other hand, plastic A stretched the least because it only stretched 10mm and 12 mm while B stretched 22mm and 23mm. ^p To improve the validity of the results, the student could have done a third or even fourth trial. This adittional data will make the results clearer. Also, the student should state how much the weights weigh so that others can preform his experiment and get similar results. He might have also wanted to include how long the pieces of plastic were originally.
a) Based on the students data you can conclude that plastic. Type B has the most stretchability. ^p b) One thing the student could have done top improve their experimental design would have been to tell how much weight to put on the clamps. They also could have said which side to clamp because edge could mean left, right or anything
One conclusion it can draw based on the student's data is that plastic type B is stretched much more (mm) than the other three types maintining the amount of 20 mm in both trials. Based on the data. Plastic type A is less flexible stretch 10mm in the first trial an 12 in the second trial. The student could have stated that they started out with unused plastics and record their initial stretch.
A conclusion to data is that plastic type B is able to stretch the furthest out of the rest of the plastic types. The student could have improved the design by adding another trial to all plastic types & also by altering the plastic to hang longer.
According to the graph,plastic type B was the plastic that was stretched when plastic that was stretched when plastic type A did not stretch as much. clearly type A is more durable and sturdy .To improve the experimental design the students should have said what each of the starting weights put on the plastic were and do a third trial to make it as accurate as possible.
My conclusion would be that after only two trials plastic type B proved to be the most stretchible of those 4 plastics. One way they could have improved was to do another trial. Another way is instead of only allowing five minutes they should of let hang untill it was about to rip in then measure giving it maximum legnth.
a) A conclusion from this data is that plastic sample B is the the most stretchable.^p b) Two ways that the student could have improved the validity of the results are making the plastic samples the same initial size and allowing the plastic samples to stretch for more than five minutes.
A) From the students results, I see that plastic B was the strongest, stretching 23 mm. Plastic D was next stretching 20 mm. Plastic C was third stretching 14 mm. Lastly plastic A was the weakest stretching 12 mm.^p B) Two ways the students can improve their experiment is to do more trials for better results. Also they could increase the height of the table to avoid the results be tampered, should the plastic stretch to the floor.
It can be concluded that plastic A is the strongest and most durable plastic it stretched significantly less then most other plastics with an average of 11mm plastic C would be the second best because it stretched an average of 13.5mm.Followed by plastic D with 20mm stretched and lastly plastic B with 2205mm stretched .The student could improve this experiment by adding a control and could be more valid by making sure each plastic was the same length.
The plastic from T2 stretched a little more than it did in T1. They could have made sure the plastic weights the same, and the could of made sure the weights were all equal in each group.
a) In conclusion to the results it can be said that polymer B is the most stretchy, followed by D, then C, then A. The only problems, is that you can't accurately judge it because you can't tell if they are all the same beginning length. A conclusion would only work if they were the same starting length. ^p b) One way to improve the design would be to specify the beginning length of the polymer strips. Another would be to indicate the amount of weight attached to each polymer.
It  seems that plastic A is the most strechable because it is the only one that stretched longer. Two ways that the students could improve the experiment is to name the different plastics. Also add heavier weights.
It can be recorded that above all others tested in the experiment, plastic type B is the most stretchable. This is because at 22.5mm it had the largest amount stretched, on average between the two trails or all other plastic types. ^p Two ways this experiment can be improved is to state the amount of weight used foeach trial, with different weights being used, results could have different from what they should have been. Also, because the amount stretched is measured in such small increments (millimeters) more trials should be performed to enhance the data's accuracy.
A)I conclusion all of the plastic stretched but plastic type B stretched the most in bath trials.^p.B) Two ways the students could have improved their experiment design and or validity of the results are.They could have told how much weight to add to the plastics.They could have told the plastic pieces original length.Those are two ways the students could have improved their experiment.
A) Overall in this experiment trial 2 had stretched more than trial 7. ^p B) Try adding more weight to the plastic bags and let the weights hung on the bags for a longer period of time.
(a)The conclusion is that all of the plastics stretched from 10 mm - 23 mm. Plastic type A stretched the least and plastic type B type B stretched the most.^p (b)The students could did a third trial, or make a fourth trial. They could added the temp and weights to the plastic types of the same time and then measured at the same time.
A) The stretchiest of the four materials was B, with the average stretchincs of 22.5mm's. ^P B) The student could have made sure to cut all the plastic into even strips of the same length and width, and second they could have performed another trial for each plastic.
a) You could tell that plastic type B would be the best plastic because it stretched the most with weights onit. ^p B) Two ways the students could have improved were said how much the weights weighed. Also they could have done a second trial with heavier weights.
A conclusion based on the student's data would be that the plastics were other a little more or less stretchy the second time due to it being stretched out the first time. One way the student could have improved the experiment design was by performing a third trial without weights. Another way would be to allow them to hand for about 10 minutes the 3rd time.
They can conclude that even after a second trial of stretching, the plastics significantly didn't stretch to much larger than trial 1.
3. In conclusion, plastic type B stretched the most because during 11 it stretched 22mm and during 12 it stretched the least. ^p The student could have improved the experiment design by adding more ways to stretch the plastic. For example, adding little heat. The results could have simply been improved with a few more trials.
Based on the students data it can conclude that plastic type D is the plastic with the most stretchability. Two ways, this experiment could have been improved is by adding more trials, also adding the amount of weights and being specific about the length of each plastic.
3. A) Plastic type B had stretched the most out of both of the trials. ^p B) added more trials more time for plastic to be hanging.
One conclusion that I can draw from this experiment is that plastic B stretched the most for both trials. 2 ways to improve the validity would to be add a control (no weight) and see if it stretches and the size of the plastic sample, just to make sure that every plastic is the same size to start.
a) A conclusion that can be made from this data is that plastic type B has the most stretchability. This is because in both trials it stretched 22-23 mm and that is more than any other plastic type tested. ^p b)Two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design was to make the weights used for every plastic sample constant. Also for the plastic samples the student could make sure to have the starting length afall the plastic types be the same and constant. Making as many aspects of the experiment constant maker fur more all work results
Plastic type A- 10(mm)T1-T2 12 ^p B-22(mm)T1-T223 C-14(mm)T1-T2 13 ^p D-20(mm) T1-T220 ^p 2 ways the student could have improved. ^p 1. Repeat the whole procedure 3 times. ^p 2. Measure 3 times the sample of one type of plastic and measure length.
I think e 11/12 40/40.
A conclusion based on the data given is that each piece of plastic stretched around the same amount each trial. This lets you know that it his as really the only amount it can given one it wasn't really change her multiple trays. Two ways the student could have improved the validity is by making each amount of plastic the same and by using the same amount or weight for each trial.
In conclusion, if the student was to go on with the investigation, T2 will allways have depending on the plastic 12, 23, 13, 20 up the numbers. ^p Two ways the students could have improved the experimtal are, 1) The could of told us how much weights to and 2) If they hang the clamp for 10min the experiment might have change.
a) I concluded that his clab is valid based upon doing multiple trials. I also noticed that the most stretchable was B and the least was A.^P b)Though two trials is good, it is best to do a third trial or fourth trial would be best. Also I think that they should have measured the length of the plastic before and have it on the the data table to compare the changes the occured in the plastics.
Based on the student's data C is wrong because the first time is streched 14mm then the second time is stretched 13 how is that possible the second trial should be more or equal if the used the same weight.^p b) He could told us how much weight he used. Also be could have done another trial to be sure his data was right.
Based on the students data I can say that plastic type C can stretch the most because in both trials plastic type C stretched atleast 9mm longer than the second hoghest plastic stretchability. To improve the experimental design the students could have said how much weight should be attached to the clamp and exactly what steps should be repeated in the second trial.
Based on this students information i would say that the first 2 exceeded, because they went up the second time. This means it went farther. But, for the last too, the went down or stayed the same. A way the student could have improved was to make step 6 in the procedure more clear, by saying what steps to repeat. Second way they could improved was by for step five put more steps because step 5 has like 3 steps in one.
The student's results show that plastic B was the most elastic. Plastic D was second. Plastic C was third and plastic A was fourth. In terms of stretchability plastic B is the most and A is the least. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and or validity is by doing more trials with different amounts of weight to really understand how stretchy the plastic is. Another way it could be changed is by changing the times of the trials to see how long it took each plastic to let the plastic get to the maximum length.
According to the data table the conclusion of this experiment would be that plastic type B stretched the most in both trials 1 and trials 2. ^p Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design or validity of the results was to try different amounts of weights that get attached to each plastic and also to let the plastic hang for different amounts of time to see the affect it would have.
a) Plastic type A has the most stretchability than the other plastic types. ^p b) The students could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results if they had more trials and a better control.
A Form the data table, it can conclude that plastic A was the most durable when stretched, and the least durable was plastic B. Plastic A stretched 10mm than 12mm while plastic B stretched 22mm than 23mm. ^P B 1. There is no indication that after the first trial, he replaced the plastic, which of made the results from trial B invalid. 2. He could have done the lab again or added a trial 3 and 4. The more you do the later the better off your results will be. It would make it more valid. 3. He could have also tried the plastics because if me great longer from another it would stretching.
a) I conclude, that Plastic type A stretched the most(2ml). ^p b)To improve the experimental design and/or mostly of the results, species the amount of weight added to the clamp, and make all pieces of places for one uniform length.
I have come to the conclusion that plastic type B has the best stretching ability since the data shows it stretched 22 mm and 23 mm. The students could have improved the validity by making sure all the plastics starting length were the same. Also, the weight added to the plastic should have stayed constant as well throughout all trials.
In conclusion, it can be said that plastic. Type B had the most amount stretched because its numbers in T1 (22)and T2 (23) were the highest. Also the plastic type that was more durable and was not stretched is muuh was plastic type A because its number in T1(10) was and T2 (12) were the lowest to improve this experiment,it would be better to include three trials and include the plastics type initial measurements to make the data table more specific and efficient.
Based on the data table, plastic type B stretched the most in the 15 minutes with the amount stretched for T 1 was 22mm and for T2 -23mm. So type B had the most stretchability .^p 2 ways the students could have improved their experiment would be labeling the type of plastic they were using instead of putting plastic type A, B, C, and D. And another way they could've improved their experiment would be tpoput how many weights they clamped to the plastic for each plastic. So we can see how far the plastics stretched, and how many weights were used.
One way the students can improve there experiment is to do a other trial to see if they misssted anything.
a) Based on the students data, plastic type B is the weakest plastic out of them all, and the strogest polymer plastic is plastic A because it was stretched the least. ^p B) The students could've included more discription on the plastic, like each plastics length or width, in order to show that everything was the same in length and width. Also the students should include in procedure on how many weights they used.
"A) Pased on the results plastic B is the most stretchy and A is the least. The order is from most shotely to  least B D C A. ^p b) The student could of improved experimental design by being more specific. He could change ""Bottom edge"" in step 3 to ""Edge of the side of the table."" Additionally he could give us the weight of the clamp weights."
My conclusion from the data presented is plastic type B and C through B and C increased higher but D stays constant at 20, those were only with two trials the student should have done more trials and should have stated the length of the paper.
A conclusion that can be made based on the data is that plastic type A is the strongest. This is ture because plastic A stretched the least about on average. Two ways that the students could have improved their lab is by saying how long the types of plastic should be and saying how many weights should be added to the clamp and how many weights should be added to the clamp because there could have been an error when the plastics were different lengths with different amounts of weights and this would make the data inaccurate.
I conclude that plastic B stretched the most but plastic D was constant. He could have added more that's. He should use brand new plastic so the test would be accurate.
a) The stretchiest kind of plastic was type B. because it stretched the most.^p ^p b) The student could have given the weights and the original length of the plastic in the procedure and made sure they were constant.
Based on the students data it is possible to see how much each type of plastic stretched, but not how much weight was needed to stretch it that far as the original length of the plastic. ^P Two ways the student could have improved the experiment are to make a more detailed procedure. Include the weight of the type of plastic, clanes instructions etc and too create a clearer table that includes the types of plastic, the original length and the weight added.
Plastic type B stretched the most in both trials one and two. Plastic type A stretched the least in both of the trials.^p The students could have improved the experiment design by conduction more trials and so stating how many weights they added on top of the clamps. The results werent valid.
a) Based on the data, the most stretchable plastic was plastic B b/c it stretched 22 mm on the first trial and 23 mm on the second trail. Also, the least stretchable plastic was plastic A b/c it only stretched in during T1 _ 12 during T2. Plastic C stretched only a bit more than plastic A. Plastic D stretched 20 mm's both times making it the 2nd most stretchable out of the 4.
A. My hypothesis was correct plastic type 'A' stretched the least during the experiment. I noticed that the plastic that stretched the least was most commonly used in our town to hold the heaviest items. ^P B. To improve the validabil of the experiment the students should have used a specific amount of each plastic not just a 'sample'. Also the students should have stretched the plastic across a gap and placed weights on top. This would have shown a more accurate assesment compared to the actoal use.
Based on the students data it is concluded that their  wasn't much stretchability from the plastic samples. Sample A increased 2mm from T1 to T2. Sample B increased 1mm from T1 to T2. Sample C decreased by 1mm from T1 to T2. Sample D stayed the same in T1 and T2. This experiment could be improved if the student had a control which would be the measure of each plastic sample without any weight added.They could also repeat the experiment.
a. Plastic B was the most stretchy. It was 22mm in the first trial in the second trial it stretched 1 more millimeter. The second most strechy polimer was plastic D I remained at 20mm both trials. ^p b. The students could have improved the experimental design! validity of the results bys I. Specifying the amount of weight added in the experiment and 2. They could have tried different ways of testing the stretchability othere how using weights.
Out of all the polmer plastics type A stretched a total of 2 mm as the best one. ^p To have a control and to make sure to tell us how long the plastic is.
a) In this experiment,it  can be concluded that plastic B had the most stretchability with 22mm in trial 1 and 23mm in trial 2. Also I can conclude that plastic A of the polymer plastics stretched the least with an average of 11m overall. Then plastic C stretched an average of 12mm and plastic D stretched 20mm^p b)Two ways to improve this experiment would have been to make sure each plastic is exactly the same length as the add to the end of the plastic they could also add a 3rd trial to make the experiment more valid.
(a) In this data it shows how far different type of plastic can be stretched. Plastic type A was stretched 2mm within trial 1 and 2. Plastic type B was stretched 1mm. Lastly plastic type D was stretched 0mm. In conclusion plastic type A was the easiest to stretch. ^p (B) Two ways it could have been improved was a have more tests and what what type of plastic.
Through this data recorded from the experiment, we can conclude that plastic A had the strongest polymer setup. This is because it stretched the least throughout both trials. One way  this experiment could have been improved is by creating more contents . For example the weights added to the clamp should have definitly been the same. Also, to improve validity, the student should have had the same starting length of plastics. thing this
a) Plastic type A was strethier because on the first trial it streched out to 10mm and in the second trial it streched out to 12mm. It had streched longer, but plastic type D seems to have been stronger, it only streched 20mm through out both of the trials.
A: I think that plastic D in both trials had the most weights out of the three other plastics from the student's data. ^P B: Two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design is one that the student could have done five trials instead of two to see the difference. Also instead of four plastics but five he or she could improve the statement too.
In conclusion in trial one plastic type B streched the most while plastic type A was the lowest in trial two plastic type B streched the furtherist. ^P Measure the height of the table, weigh the weights.
(A) Plastic type B was able to hold the most weights for each trial. ^p (B) Two ways they could have improved the experiment or validity is doing more trials for each plastic or they  could have let the plastic hang for longer than just 5 minutes.
A) Based on the student data table. Ii can conclude that plastic types A is the strongest because it didn't stretch that far. in the first trial it only stretch 10mm and in T2 it only strech 12, I can also conclued that plastic type D is the weakes because in both trial it strech 20mm. ^p B)The student could have improve the experiment either by leaving the weights on longer or by add more heavier weights
Based on this student's data, the type with the most amount of stretching was plastic type b with 20mm and plastic A had the least with 10 the first trial and 12 the second. The student could've conducted more trials as well as stated what the types of plastic were.
The plastic with the least stretch would be plastic A because it had a small change from 10mm to 12mm. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results are have the clamps and weights be the same ones everytime and make sure the plastic is on the side of the table not going on the top of the table.
a. I concluded that plastic type B had the best stretchability and plastic type A had the least.^P b. The student should have included in the procedure how many weight to put on the clamp and describe where on the bottom edge of the plastic to put the clamp.
In conclusion the students data show that when the plastic was stretch each material stretched only 1-2 mm. This is not a very big change in length. The data also showed that for one of the plastics after stretched lost a mm of length. So this was not a very succsecfull lab. ^P One thing that they could do to improve this is to tell us what kind of plastic to use so the experiment is easier to test and also to have a control variable to really see the change in plastics.
My conclusion is that type B is the most stretchy, based on the results. The student should have improved this by doing it in even trials even though. Other could be how, put there's experiment on the table. This would have improved the validity.
a. Type D plastic stretched the same amount in trial 1 and 2. It stretched 20mm. ^p b. In the procedure the students can get rid of step 7 because step 6 basically states the same thing. Also, they could have done three trials for more data.
In conclusion, plastic D stretched more than all the other plastics two steady trials of 20mm each. Plastic type A & B both stretched a little more in trial 2 and plastic type C stretched less. Plastic type B stretched the most having stretched 22 then 23mm. ^p Improve:(1). Show in graph beggining length of plastic ^p (2) Create a T3 and try it once more. ^p (3) Add another 3 trials with different weight.
In conclusion plastic type B is the most polymer for stretchability because in both trials it erected the most making it the most stretched out of the all other polymers.^p Two ways the student could have improved is by saying which plastics the students used for each so the people would know if the data is correct and by saying how much weight was used to stretch the plastic.
A) In conclusion plastic type
a) Plastic type B can be stretched the farthest. ^P b) -1) The students could have specified how heavy the weights were. ^P 2) They could've let the plastic hang for more than 5 minutes.
A conclusion could be that plastic type B had the best results for strechability with 22m and 23m. To make the expirement more valid the group could haved run more trials and they also could used more detail in the procedure like stated how heavy the weights were.
"I think that the data they have is correct but it shows that plastic type ""A"" is the only one that has a lower trial than the other types. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment was to tell how heavy the weights were and what plastic was used."
(A) In conclusion, plastic B and D have more stretchability than A and C because plastics B and D stretched an average of 21mm while plastics A and C stretched an average of 12mm. ^p (B) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design are to do more trials and to add a control.
Based on the student's data, it is easy to conclude that plastic type D was the most constant through both trials with a measurement of 20 mm. The student's, though could have improved their experiment by doing more trials and by also being more specific. For example, saying what types of plastic they used instead of saying A, B, C or D. Also they could have said how much weight was added so that it is clear and exact.
A. In conclusion, based on the student's data polymer plastic B stretch the most in both trials done & the least that stretch both trials was type A, leaving us to see B is the most stretchable from all for types. ^p B She could have included a time limit for the plastic to dangle freely. Second she could have made a graph to have it be more visual.
Based on the data, we can tell that plastic type A stretches the least amount of all other types of plastic. It only stretched an average of 11 mm which was less than all others. The students could improve their experiment by adding another trial. This always verifies the validity of an experiment. They could also verify how long the strip of plastic is and keep that constant throughout the experiment.
A conclusion draw is that trail 1 the plastic wasn't that strong to pull but trail 2 it went far and was stretched more. Plastic type D was the same in trail 1 and 2. The students could have improved the experimental design by maybe adding another trial to see what you get. Also they could have use diffrent plastic for the trials.
Based on the student's data, plastic D stretched the same length for both trials. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be to on the data table, say how long each type of plastic is before the student started the experiment. Another way the student could of improved the experimental design would be to have done only one trial instead of two.
I cannot draw a conclusion because important information is missing from the table. The students could have improved the test by adding in the plastic length to the data table. They also could have included the ammount of weight the weights weigh.
A) The students wanted to see which plastic was mor strechibal. B) Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is by doing a 3rd trial say how far off the table.
a) Based on the data, they can conclude that plastic B stretched the most.^p b) They could have included the mass of the weights added. They also should have included the size of the plastic samples.
My conclusion is trials (T2) stretched better than (T2). The student could have used a different type of plastic and they could have just made the sample very larger.
a. Based on the student data, plastic type B stretched the most. Plastic type stretch 22 and 23 mm. ^p b. The student could have been more specific about the amount of weights to add.
A) Plastic type B stretched the most probably hefty or ziplock) ^p B) Taken thickness temp in room, original length, etc.
The plastic type B stretched the most out of all the other plastic types. Two ways the student could have improved his experiment was, 1) to include in his data table how much weight he used on the clamp. 2) To include what the starting length of the plastic was in his data table.
The students wanted to determine in this experiment which type of plastic A, B C, or D was able to stretch the most. Based on the data, plastic B had the best stretchability and was able to stretch 22 mm in the first trial and 23 mm in the second trial. The students could have conducted more trials to improve the validity of their results. To improve their experimental design they could have been more specific and stated how many weights should be added to the plastics and to better control the experiment.
Based on the data table I would say that plastic D was your strongest plastic, because it didn't stretch. One way they could of improved the experiment was to run a trial 3 to tell plastic D. Another way they could of improved the experiment is by adding many weights.
Based on the students data, the plastic B is the most strechable polymer plastic. Plastic A is the least strechable. This is because plastic B was streched at 22mm (1st trial) and 23mm (2nd trial). Comparing it to the others, it streched the furthest. Plastic A only stretched 10mm (1st trial) and 12mm (2nd trial). To improve this experiment, the students should have had a control choosing a specific plastic. They also should have done one more trial to ensure validity. Three trials can help make this definite.
In conclusion the plastics stretched more during the second trial than the first.The second trial the first. The second trial all plastics stretched further except for type C and D which did not change. Two ways to make this better would have been to do a third trial and to specify how much the weights were.
a) Based on the students data, plastic type B stretched the most at an average of 22.3mm, while plastic A stretched a mere 11mm average. Plastic D stretched the second most with an average of 20mm and then plastic with 13.5 average mm. The average in stretchability is due to the different chemical composites of each plastic. ^p b) The student could have improved the validity and design by recording how much weight was used, which would allow someone to replicate the experiment and recording the percentage stretched rather than just how much. A sample that is 10cm but stretched 10mm is a much more significant change than one that is 10 meters and stretched 10mm, but the data table fails to recognize that.
In conclusion all the plastic types are all different amount stretched. The plastic stretching out in trials 1-2 are going up and down. ^p The student could have improved by doing a third trial to show more of the results. Explain why they added more weight.
Based on the students data I can conclude that plastic type A was the strongest because it stretched the least amount. ^p b) For the student to improve the experimental design they could have written how much weight the put on the plastics. and to improve, the validity they should have done a third trial.
A.In the polymer investigation there werent a lot of change plastic type a stretched only 2 mm, type B stretched 1 mm, type c stretched 1mm and D stayed the same.^p B.Could of been more accurate with the steps on the procedure.
a) In conclusion plastic type B has the highest stretchability and plastic type A was the lowest. This shows that A is the most non-flexible and the most durable to stretchy tasks. Plastic B is the stretchiest and can hold up to 23mm. ^p They could've added a list of materials in the beginners and a hypothesis to see what they were trying to test.
The plastic type A is shown to be the the strongest plastic type. Mean while the plastic type B shows to be the plastic that stretched out the longest.
In conclusion, based on the students data there are four different type of plastic. Based of the plastic are T1,T2 their amount stretched (mm). And based in the Dutch table T2 is more stretched than T1. The students can describe experimental based in diffent plastic . And the students can based in that data table the T2 is more stretched.
a) After investigating how much each plastic type stretched, a conclusion has made that plastic type B stretched most than D, Than C and plastic type A stretched the least. b) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design was to first use the same starting length of the plastic bag that could effect the results and secondly be more specific about how much weight to add.
Based on the data, plastic type B stretched the most out of all of the plastics. Type A stretched an average of 11mm, type C stretched an average 13.5mm and type D stretched 20mm. But type B stretched 20cm but type B stretched the most with an average of 22.5mm. ^P B) The student could have improved his experiment by telling how long the plastic was as well as how the weights weighed. Another thing the student can do is add one more trial.
A conclusion that can be drawn based on the students data is, plastic type B had the greatest amount of stretchability in (mm). In both trials the plastic stretched further than the other type. In trial 1 22mm, and trial 2 23mm. 3. The student could have made this lab more valid by adding the different types of plastics that were labeled A, B, C, and D and also the student could have set an exact length for each plastic so they all started at the same measurement.
A. The students could have concluded that plastic type B has the largest amount of stretchability, because type B stretched 22 min in trial one and 23 mm in trial 2. ^p B. The students could have improved the validity of their experiment by; 1. Doing more trials to collect more data. 2. Allow the clamps with the weights to hang longer than 5 min.
A) A conclusion that can be brought from the data is that plastic type B is the best type of plastic fore  stretchability because it stretched 22mm and 23mm on it's trials. ^p B) Two ways the students could have improved this experiment is by having or stating that the plastics all had the same initial measurement. Also, the student could have named the type of plastics. The validity can be questioned because it is unknown if they were the same length to begin with and the plastic is unknown.
Based on the students data, plastic B stretches more than the other plastics. The students could improve this experiment by checking the temperature of the room because plastic's elasticity varies on the temperature. Another improvement would be to measure the amount of weight that is being put into each bag.
The data showas the plastic for stretching more in B. Because maybe the put or did different procesure. But experiment D have the same type of stretching. The procesure are the same or maybe he did it three times. The students have to do the procesure, they have to do the experiment like three time as or more. The need to have all the materials and put it in order. The need to have his own question. Find his conclusion.
My conclusion is that plastic type D stretched the farthest both trials. They could have done another trial and they could have put more weights on the clamp so it can stretch more.
Plastic type A held up best against the wheight of the wheights. So I would use the plastic out of any where. Plastic type D expanded and stretched the most. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experiment was, one; name the plastics and two; tell how much the wheights wheighed.
a) A conclusion I can draw with the data present is that some plastics are more stretchy than others. For example plastic B is much more stretchy then plastic A. ^p b) To improve there experimental design and validity the results they could of added another trial. Also to say how much plastic measured before the plastic was stretched.
One way it would have been good to improve the experiment is listing the steps or procedure properly.
A) My conclusion based on the students data would be that plastic B has the highest stretchability. I say this because plastic B had stretched more in 5 minitues than any of the other plastics in this expirement. ^p B) There are many ways this student could have improved their designs. One way they can improve their designs is to provide the weights of both the samples and weights. They could have also add more trials to improve their design.
A)Based on the data that the st recordity I think plastic B will work better with 23mm. When the stud 22mm and plastic T2 with 23mm, when the student have to add weight to clam and allow for 5 minutes.^p (B)Anex could add more trial and try other type of plastic.
From the students data looks like the first trials were good but the second trials the plastic stretches more. It looks like the second trial for A, B, C, O hanged there for a by with the weights the last trial. The student could have improved the experimental design if it would of have more plastics and add ,ore minutes to see what would happen if it stayed longer then 5 minutes. Another way could have been if you knew how many weights you were putting on the clamp. So youwill know how many weights and how long would make this experiment improve.
3. a) Plastic A is the most resistant and the strongest because it stretched the least out of the 4 plastics. This is due to being created with more or stronger polymer chains. ^p b) The experiment could be improved by using the same amount of the weights on each type of plastic. This would show how the strengths of the plastic differ mere accurately. Also, the trial should be performed more than 2 times. Since results varied greatly by up to 2mm with the 2nd trial, this variation would be minimized with more trials.
base on the data table plastic type B stretched the most amount in 22 mm in trial 1 and 23 mm in trial  before apping. The two ways the students could have improved their experiment better is by lableing how much weight was the weight add they to the clamp and also by adding more trials to see more accracy.
In the procedure it doesn't have a clear problem of what is happening on the experiment. On procedure 7, it doesn't tell you the trial that thy did for the first one. Two ways the students can aprove is on the last trial explains whats the first trial is and not make the person reading it not to know whats the trial is. The last way is for number four it says add weights to the clamp and alowthem to hange for 5 minutes. How heavy are the weights you need to use on the experiment.
a. Based on the data below it is saying that the plastic could stretch depending on what or how strong the plastic is. B. Explain what is clamp. Have a third trial or have lest durable plastic to do the trials.
3/4 increased by 1, 1/4 decreased by 1 and 1/4 stayed the. ^p b.) Two ways of improving; ^p 1)Used a different weight for second trial. ^p 2) Or used four different types of plastic.
Based on the student & data i can draw the conclusion that plastic type A only stretched an average of 11mm so it was the strongest and stretched out of all the other plastic types. ^p b. The student could have improved the experiment by doing one more trial for a total of three trials for each plastic type for accuracy and he/she could have measured the initial length of the plastic.
NSR
A. In conclusion we found that plastic type B had the most stretchability, it stretched out the most both trials and that plastic type A was less stretchable. ^p B. Two ways the students can improve there experiment design is to do three more so the experiment can be more valid and 2 they should identify how much weight they put on the clamp.
One way the coud of used rocks instead of weights to improve the experiment design. ^P Second way instead of measure the length after the weight they should measure the length of the plasic while the weight was ve there.
A conclusion I can make based on the student's data is that plastic A can only stretch about 11 mm. Plastic B can strech about 22.5mm. Plastic C can strech about 13.5 mm and plastic D can only strech 20 mm. One way the experiment could have been improved is by skeeping the weight added through out the experiments the same. The second way to improve the experiment is for the plastic to be maesured in asmaller unit rather than mm.
a) My conclusion is that plastic type D was the strongest of them all.^p B) Two way he can improve the experiment is be using the same amount of time, and the same amount of plastics.
a) The conclusion I can get from the data is plastic A went from 10mm to 12mm, plastic B went from 22mm to 23mm, plastic C went down from 1mm to 13mm, and plastic D stayed at 20mm. ^p B) The way they could improved the experimental design is by doing a 3rd trial, and showed how much weight they used.
a.) A conclusion I can draw from the experiment is that that plastic type B has the most stretchability because it stretched the greatest amount of mm which wass 22mm in trial 1 and 23mm in trial 2. ^p b.) The student could improve this experiment by specifying a certain length all polymer plastics should start out as so they all begin on the same level and therefore the data is accurate. Also, the student could specify how many milimeters of each plastic should be taped to the table so they all start put the same length & make the data more accurate.
"A) plastic type B was the most stretchable while plastic type A was the least. ^p B) They could add more trials and be more specific when the say ""weights"" by adding how heavy the weights are."
It will be not that different from the other test that was done because if there went down or up a little. He could have done a bar graph for the things he was trying to figure out about it all or just had at least told the time he did it.
a. Plastic type B has shown to be the most stretchable polymer plastic by stretching about 23 mm. ^p b. One way the student could have improved the experimental design is by doing more trials. Another way would be writting down how many weights they added to each plastic type.
Each plastic type had stretched about 1-2 millimeters, as where type D did not stretch much, therefore the type D plastic was the strongest.^p Two ways the students should have improved there experimental design would be not to use the same plastic each trial, do it three times instead of two, and include the length from floor to table.
a) Based  on the students data, plastic type A had the strongest resistance against weight and therefore makes it stronger than the rest because plastic A stretched 10-12mm while plastic B stretched 22-23mm. ^p b) The students should have had the same size plastic strips for each type. A third and an averaged measurement for each plastic would make the data even more valid.
a) Plastic type B stretched the most while plastic type a stretched the least. This shows that plastic type B have less cross linking of its polymers while plastic A had the greatest amount of cross linking. ^p b) One way the students could have improved their experiment could be, add another trial to get a bigger range to make sure the data is accurate, another way the students could have improved their experiment is by adding more plastic types for a longer sample size.
3.a. The students experiment was a good experiment because ( they had 4 different plastic types they had two trials to check and recheds for experiment. ^p b. They could have had more trials, they should had more plastic types.
A) Based on the data as you see, different type of plastic they would be different or the same on both trials. For example plastic type A first. Trial is werent stretchable and when you repeat it again it would change. ^p B) Two ways to make it better was have more different plastics and maybe add more weight to the clamp to see what changes.
a) My conclusion according to the data would be that plastic B stretched the most. ^p B) Some ways the students could improve their experiment is if they said how much weights was on the plastics. Also they should of not have done the second trial exactly the same as the first cause there would be no difference so the data should be the same as the first because the second trial was supposed to be done exactly the same as the first.
a: Plastic type b has the most amount of stretchability in all the four plastics. ^P b: The students could have repeated the experiment a third time and made sure that they were adding the same size weights everytime.
"a. Plastic type B was the polymer plastic with the greatest stretch length. Plastic type A was the most resistant to stretch. b. The students need to make a couple of changes to improve the validity of the results. In step 1 of the procedure, it says ""take a sample of one type of plastic B measasure its length"". This is misleading because all 4 polymer plastics should be the same length at the beginning of the experiment. This is important b/c the longest should be the piece is at the beginning can affect how much it will stretch. Finally students need to change step 9 ""add some weights"" to a specific number of weight. This is important b/c if they put more weight on one plastic it will stretch farther, than a plastic w/ less weight attached."
I guess when the plastic reaches a certain amount it will break. ^p They should of used a different type of plastic to see how it works out.
In conclusion. Plastic A was the least streched after two tries also plastic B was the most stretchest after the two tries. The student could have improved the experimental design by being more specific and also measured the length of the materials before doing the experiment.
Based on the student's data I can conclude that plastic type B is the strongest. For example, in trial 1 it stretched 22 mm and in trial 2 it stretched 23 mm. ^p Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design are adding another trial and increase the amount of time it hangs.
A)Plastic type B is more flevable and stronger, some plasticstretch more after the first trial like 10mm-12mm^p B) I think having more trials so his data can be more percise and having A catrol
Plastic type B is the stretchiest while type A is the least stretchy. Two ways they could improve the experiment is by adding more trials and check to make sure all other variables are constant such as temperature.
Plastic type B stretched more than all other plastic types.^p One way  the experiment could have been improved is if they kept on adding weights until the plastic broke and measured how much weight it can hold. Another way is of puting one plastic on top of another and add the weight and see if that changes how far one on the plastic stretches.
The students conclusion was not much because there was many types of plastics to choose from. ^p The students could have improved the experiment if the student picked a certain type of plastic not any type. Other reason is that they not the weights in the same spot in trial 1 and trial 2.
"a) In conclusion of this experiment, plastic type B seemed to stretch the most in both trials of the experiment. Also it seems as if plastic type A was the stacking in the experiment as it only stretched a half the amount of plastic type A. ^p b) Instead of ""add weights"" they could have given a specific amount of time. They also could have given the original lengths of each plastic."
a) Based on our results, we can conclude that plastic B was the weakest because it stretched the most. Plastic A was the strongest because it stretched the least. ^p b) They could have mentioned more contents such as the weight they put on the bag sample every trial. ^p They should have had a control, atrial where no weights were added.
A conclusion of the experiment would be that plastic B was the stretchiest plastic. Also, that plastic A was the least stretchy. Make all the plastic samples the same length and make sure that T1 and T2 have the same amount of plastic.
3.a) The plastics A +b stretched farther the 2nd time but d+c stayed the same or went down. ^p B) Stretched it a third time or measure it when it was hanging off the table.
A)Based on the student's data, the plastic that has has the most stretchability is plastic type A. It started at 10 mm and then the weight added on it stretched to 12mm. Plastic type D has no stretchability, It remained at 20 mm for the second trial.^p (b) One way the student could have improved the results and validity of them is by stating how much weight was added to each type of plastic bag. Also if you record the length A was before adding weights, you can see how for each bag stretched from itself. Right now there is no constant in the experiment.
Based on the students data, it can be seen that plastic B stretched 22mm (T1) and 23mm (T2) making it the most stretchable. ^p The students could have improved the experiment by including the length of the plastics before stretching them. Also, they need to include how much weight to add to the plastic, making it the same for each plastic to be valid.
The conclusion of this experiment would be that type B was the most amount stretched, it stretched 22 then try 2 was 23 meanwhile type A stretched the least. In try one A stretched 10 & 2nd try stretched 12. The two ways students can improvr the experimenta; design, is to always give it a 3rd try. What is your control.
From reading this students procedure and reviewing their data, I have realized some plastics are significantly better than others. The data shows that plastic type B that stretched 22mm and 23mm, and plastic type D stretched 20mm both times. Types B and C because that table shows A that stretched 10 and 12mm are type C stretched 14 and 13 mm. In conclusion, plastic type B and D are much stronger than A and C. b) Two ways they could have improved the experimental design is allowing them to hang for more than 5 minutes to get better data. Also, running a third trial will improve their results.
In the second trial, plastic A the stretch increased by two bara, Plastic B the second trial increased by one mm: almost it decreased one mm now in plastic D the stretch stayed the same. Two ways student could have improved their lab or validity, one was to have a third trial so you could see if there would have been a great change or to see which results were closer to results one and two to make your final choice. Another way to improve the lab was to try different measurements of plastic.
According to the experiment, the type of plastic that had the greatest ability to stretch was plastic B. In both trials, this plastic stretched a few mm more than the rest. In the first trial it stretched 22mm and in the second 22mm. ^P The student could have improved the experiment by using a certain amount of weights added so that all the plastics would be under the same pressure and to add a control such as no weights. The control would have made a good bomparison to the data gathered and the amount of weights would have made created controlled variables.
Plastic type B has the best stretchability out of all the other plastics. two ways that the students could improve on there experimental design and valitedy is by having a control and by telling the reader the amount of weights to the plastic so that they can replicate the procedure.
Based on the students data the plastic type D was the stretcheyest. And plastic type A was the least streechyest at of all the other plastics one way the student could have improved his results was if he/she added the same amount of weights everytime .Also If they did more trials they would probly get more validity results.
In conclusion,you can conclude that plastic B measured the longest which was 12 (T1) and 23 (T2), also you can see that plastic type D had came the closes to plastic B, plastic D measured 20mm for both trials^p b) They could improve their experiment if the actually added more minutes each trial to see different outcome and compare. Also, could've added more weights.
Based on this student's results I can conclude that the most stretchable plastic is type B. Type B plastic stretched 22 mm the first trial and 23 mm the second trial. Some thing that could have been done to improve the validity of the experiment would be to do a third trial. In an experiment can make the results more accurate depending on the amount of trials there are in your experiment.
The data shows that the plastic types stretched about the same in both trials. In the procedures the student must say which she is recording the data. I think the data would have a better conclusion if the student did another trial for each different plastic.
A) The order from the most stretchable to the lest strechable is plastic types B first, D second, C third, and A last. Plastic type B streched the furthest at 22mm 1st trail and 23mm the second trial. A was the least strechability and streched 10mm 1st trail and 12mm the second. ^P B) The student could have done more trails or they could have let it hand longer.
(A) In conclusion, based on the students data, the plastic samples stretched slightly more in the second trial. Plastic type D was the only plastic that kept its length constant. (B) To improve the validity of the results I would've measured the plastic's width. To improve the design, I would've used a fifth plastic type to expand my results.
The plastic that were being stretched all come out to a different length. On the second trial of stretching the some plastics someway the numbers would forely the some give or take a few. The student could have improved the experiment by leaving the plastic to stretch larger and see if there is a different result. Also the student doesn't know if each type of plastic is the exact same so the strength could have varied and changed the whole experiment.
The polymer type B had the greatest stretchability because its average amount stretched was the greatest. At 22.5mm stretched average it was higher than type D's 20mm average.Types A and C were less stretchable than type B by 11.5mm and 9mm respectively. The valiability of the results could be increased by the reasing the amount of trials. This way the averages would be closer to what they should be. The design also could be improved by starting the weight of the weights. 2000kg and 200g would be a kings difference on results.
To test four different polymer for stretchability the student would need to record the data from the investigation to procedure, and perform a second trial exactly just like the first trial. Two ways a student could improve the experimental design and the validity of the result is first off, could try two more 'test' trials to see if the plastic type and amount stretched can be improved, second off, could use the conclusion to help out with the experiment.
In conclusion, the strongest plastic that held up is plastic type B. In trail one was statend 22mm and trail; two was 23mm, while plastic type A got 10mm for the first trail and 12mm for the second trail. So over all the plastics, type B  is the one that can hold up the longest and is more durable. One way this lab could do is to add more trails. Then another improvement could be to explain exly in the produre to get three more bags.
a) After evaluating the student's data, it appears that plastic type A stretches the least (10mm- 12mm) and plastic type B stretches the most (22mm-23mm). Therefore sample B is the most stretchy.^p b) The student could have improved the experimental validity by specifying how heavy the weights were that were being added to the bags. Another way to improve the experiment design would be yo test the experiment in multiple trials, using a different length of time each trial.
a) From the data, I've seen, I can conclude that plastic type B stretched the most even though between both trials it only increased 1 mm, 22-23. But on the otherhand plastic type D only hit 20 and stayed 20, still being close to B. ^P b) I know two way that I could improve the experiment; first the student should say how long each plastic should be; second, the student should say how much weight is being put on each time.
"According to their, the students results, plastic sample A is the least stretchy while sample B was the most stretchy. I do not, however, believe these results are valid. They should have used exact measurement when saying to ""add weight"" to the clamp. Another thing they could have done was added a third trial for increased accuracy, and to that same note come up with an average stretch distance for each sample, making it even more accurate."
So they should of told us if we have to wait five wen for all three bottles or do we time it different one another. Also do we use the same length for all three plastic bag or are we spouse to use a different length for all three plastic bag.
A) The student are trying to figure out which plastic can stretch more than the other without braking adding weights. ^p (B) The students could improve the experiment if they were to add a specific number of weights to each plastic. Also having the same measurement size for each plastic.
a) Based on the data, plastic type B had the most stretchability followed by type A,C, and lastly type A. ^P b) One way the students could have improved their experiment design would be to identify a set mass of the weights. The students also identify a certain amount of type to have the same resistanes.
As we can come to a close the students in results were very close numbers when they did trial 1 and then trial 2, we can see that when they stretched both trials they got the same answers 20mm. This is what we can conclude about the data.
From the data, it's drawn that type B has the most stretchability than the others. In trial one, it held the highest weight count for 20 weights. In the second trial it had a total of 23. For the experiment to give a more accurate result, the weights should have been added on past the limit for each plastic. That way data could show how many weights each held until breaking, strengthening the results for or against the hypothesis.
A) Both plastics no matter how far its stretch, weather its in trial one or trial two, is that their both about the same (mm) maybe off by one/two. ^P B) Two switch up the difference from trial 2 to trial 1. Also to use different plastics to see different results.
a. From the data table it can be said that plastic A is the most stretchy and that the other plastics have little to no stretchability. ^P b. ^P 1. The length of the plastics need to be kept constant. ^P More trials need to be done, at the minimal, three.
(A) After finding all of the measurements and recording the data, I can see that plastic type B has the most stretchability. Then  plastic type S, then C and finally A, which has the least amount of stretchability.
The student can conclude that type B was the most stretchable while type A was the least. The student should have given an exact length for each plastic to be stretched. The student should also have the exact amount of weighs that was to be applied.
A) The student tested the plastic 4 different types they altumetly had the same close 1 to 2 mm streach rate.^p B) The student could have stated how much each whight should whigh he could have also changed the results then messure or record the difference.
a) Plastic type A was able to overall stretch the most compared to other three plastic types. ^p b) The students could have improved the validity of the results by having more trials and by having a control group.
The plastic streched more and more each time. ^p I think that the student could have been more specific when writing out the steps because it would have been easier to understand the data.
a. Based on the student's data I conclude that plastic type D has the most stretchability than all the other plastic types. In both trials they stretched to 20mm while the other plastic types didnt that far. ^p Two ways the student would have improved the experimental design/ validity is 1) did one more trial to make sure its possible stretchability. 2) used same materials.
A. The students concluded plastic B can stretch the farthest, but plastic A is the most durable.^p B) The students could had a control & the students could have made the samples the same size.
One way the student could improve the experiment better is by putting the plastic in both directions at the same time. Another way he could improve is he could add heavier weights to get better data. ^p In conclusion when he added the weights to one end that made the plastic stretch and, increasing its size.
The conclusion
Based on the student's data, the conclusion can be made because their is nothing to the test the results to. This experiment can be improved by measuring the initial length at the polymer to show the difference in length that the weight did and allow for a conclusion. This can also improve by adding a control to test against their variables to add to the validity.
a) Plastic B is the stretchial polymer or plastic low of the ones tested it can stretch the most. Plastic A stretched the least. ^P b) 1) The student needs to specify how many weights should be added & how much those weights shall weigh. ^P 2) The student should also have said how much of the plastic should be hanging off the table as this should remain the same for every plastic type they should be placed at the same points on the table.
Based on the students data you can't really come to a conclusion because there isn't enough data. Two ways the student could improve the experiment are by adding more trials to the data is better and by stating that all of the plastics were cut to the same length you would want to do that because if the plastics aren't all the same lengths that could affect the data.
a) Plastic B stretched the most amount  therefore it is the most stretchabil. b) The students could have measured the length after 10 minutes instead of 5 minutes. They could have added more weights.
Plastic B had the greatest stretchability the students should have included how much the weights they used weighed and how many weights they used. Also they should have included another trial.
a) Plastic B stretches the most. ^p b) The student should have kept the length and width of the plastic samples constant and specified how much weight to attatch.
a.) Plastic type B has the highest stretchabilty.^p b) The students could have improved the experimental design and validity of their results. They could have specified the amount of weights and kept that constant. Also, they could have done a third trial for each plastic to increase accuracy.
For plastic tube A and b the amount stretched went up a point. For plastic tube c it went down a pont and for D the plastic stretched stayed the same. ^P They could of improved by letting the plastic sit for a min.
"My conclusion based on this data is that plastic type ""B"" stretched the most in both the first and second trial. One way this student could have made their experiment better would be by re arranging their procedure and doing # 7 before #6. Another way they could have improved would be by allowing the reader to know how heavy the weights were that were used in this experiment."
a). Plastic type B is the most stretchable. ^p b). The validity of the experiment would be improved if a control were added. The control in this experiment would be a plastic hanging off the table with no weight for five minutes. Also, the experiment does not specify whether to use the same amount of weight for all plastics or the specific amount thats suppose to be used. To improve the experiment the specific amount of weight should be mentioned and should be held constant for all plastics.
Two ways that the students could have improved the experimental design and for validity of the results was probelly trying the experiment with a bigger cup not a small cup. Second would be then potting more weight to the cup and then maybe their would be a difference on the experiment.
a) Plastic type B stretched more than any of the other types of plastic in both of its trials. ^p b) One way the student could have improved their experimental results would be to have a third trial of all the practice to enhance precision and accuracy of results. Another way to improve thes results would be to average the figures from the trials.
The conclusion that can be made from this students investigation is that plastic type B stretched the most. To improve the experimental design the students can give a better understanding on how to hold down the plastic and where to put the clamp. They should give more measurements for that so their results do not vary so much.
Based on the data each plastic improved on T2. Two ways they could have improved the experiment was by making sure they used the sam weight for each trial and also use a stop watch to get exact time.
In conclusion plastic type B has the most stretchability. Also plastic type A has the least stretchability. The student could have had another trial.
Based on the student's data you can draw a conclusion that plastic type B stretched the farthest amount. One way the student could have improved the experimental design would be by adding more trials. Another way would be by controlling the measurement of the plastic and weights so each are the same.
Most plastics stretched 1 to 2 inches longer, one didn't stretch at all and another actually become shorter. I think this data is wrong. When you tape the plastic, tape an inch on the table then add the inch to the final result. They should also put a certain amount of weights.
In conclusion, out of the 4 tested polymer plastics, plastic type B proved to have the best stretchability because it stretched 22 mm during T1 and 23 mm during T2. One way the students could've improved their experiment is to preform a 3rd trial so results can be proved to be more reliable. A second way they can improve is to run a trial where the plastics hold weights for maybe 10 minutes so they could conclude if maybe some plastics would break in the process of being stretched.
One way the students could have improved the experimental design is to add how much weight they were putting on the plastics. Another way they could have improved the experimental design is to do another trial.
Based on the data, I would conclude that plastic type B stretched the most, as it had an average of 22.5 mm stretched. One way the student could have improved his experiment design would have been to add another trial so that the results would have been more valid the to more results to a range. Another way the student could have improved his experiment would have been to give a specific mass for the weights attached to the plastic so that other people can do the experiment and get the same results.
The conclusion that can be drawn from the label is that the second trial was more succesful at being stretched out. Two ways that the students could of improved the design of the results are increasing the amount of time the plastic was stretched. Also hey could of changed the amount weight was on the clamp to. To me it would be also helpful if a control was run to compare results.
(a) From the given results, one can conclude that plastic type B is the stretchiest type out of the four that were tested. ^p (b) However, there are same ways that the validity of this experiment could be improved. One improvement could be to specify the original length of the plastic. If the sizes vary, the data found is useless. Uncomparable. Another improvement to this experiment could be to perform more trials. You can not obtain consistancy, a needed ingredient in an ideal experiment, in only two trials.
a)In conclusion the plastic type D stretched the most compared to any other plastic.^p b) One way the experiment could be improved would be to keep the length of the given plastic equal. Another improvement would live to add the same amount if weight to each plastic and lot the weight the procedure.
a. In conclusion, after five minutes the plastic types were stretched longer for plastics A and B. Plastic c decreased in trial 2, and plastic d stayed the same.^p b. Two ways, the student could have improved the experiment are: 1. Added or decreased the weights amount in trial 2.2. let the weights hang for longer/shorter amount of time.
The student should have wrote the weight of the structer, the color and more about the size.
a) I can conclude from the results plastic type A stretched the most out of all the other plastic types. ^p b) They could of added more details to the procedure. For example to record all our data.
A) The plastic type B was the stretchiest and A was the least stretchy. ^p B) One way this experiment design could be improved is have multiple times recording the stretch length like 5, 10, 15 minutes. The other way is adding more weights.
I concluded that plastic type B was the most stretchable. ^P One way they could improved this experiment was by completing three or more trials. ^P A second way they could improve this experiment is to limit the weights they put on the plastics then have it go up as a whole.
In the experiment, plastic type B stretched the most with 222-23mm in length, type A stretched least with 10-12mm in stretching. C stretched the second least (14-13mm) and D closely followed B (20mm in stretching). It is very clear that plastic type B has the most stretchability and type A has the least. To improve this experiment one could designate how much weight should be applied to the clamp for each repeating of procedure on each of the four plastics. Also, a control group could be added.
A conclusion I can draw from this experiment is that the second trial (T2) had increased the amount of plastic stretched, all expert plastic type C which remioved the same two ways the students could have improved the experimental designs was by measuring the weights for each clamp and another way was to have a third trial.
A conclusion could be that different plastics have different amounts that it could be stretched at. The student could have improved the experimental design by having 3 trials an varity of cups.
a) Plastic type B stretched the most during both trials of this experiment. ^p b) First, the student should have used the same length of each plastic. Finally, the student should make sure each type of plastic is hanging the same length off the table.
The conclusion drawn from the data would be that plastic type B stretches the most, because it was the longest length after being stretched. The student could improve the experiment by adding more trials, to get more data to drawn make accurate conclusion from. The student could also cut the plastic to the same starting length in order to ensure that they all have the same start, and the results would be more accurate.
A) The whole procedure worked out well. I think the results came out to be almost the same when they repeated it.^p B) I think the student should have 'did' a third trial. Also I think he should have chase two different plastics to see how each one does with clamps hanging from them on the table
In conclusion to the polymer investigation lab, it is clearly known that plastic type B was the most stretchable while plastic type A was the least, according to the data collected. To improve the experiment the lab testers should have made sure that the plastic were all at the same length at the stare and recorded it. Also, they should've made sure they used the same weights.
In conclusion, The polymer plastic that was the most stretchable, according to our experiments data, was plastic type A (10mm-12mm). The polymer plastic that we found to be the least stretchable was plastic C which actually shrank, it went from 14mm to 13 mm. Plastic B stretched 1mm and plastic D was impervous to the weight and didn't change/. A couple of ways the students can improve this experiment would be to at more trials to increase the validity and they can specify the actual weight that they used for the experiment.
(a) In conclusion it seems that plastic B has stretched the most because the highest it stretched is 23mm and all the others we lower at 12,14 and 20mm.^p (b) One way the student could have improved their experiment is to tell in the prosedure how long to cut the plastic so they all start at the same size. Therefore these results are not valid because we don't know if they were on even length when they started.
a) Plastic type B stretched the most in both T1 and T2. ^p b) The students could have improved by stretching it differently, in different ways, that way you can see better, as to which B stretches the best. Another way it could have improved would be by it saying to do things in the same place with the same measurements.
A). The data that  the students recorded is incorrect. ^p B). Two ways the students could have improve  the experiment by adding a control and by adding another performance trial to the experiment.
After looking at the data, it showed that plastic type B stretched the most at 22 mm(T1) and 23 mm(T2). Two ways the experiment could have been improved could be to tell us the types of plastics and their starting lengths. Also, to specify the amount of weight thats put or in step four.
A) The conclusion I drew based on the student's data is that plastic type B stretches the most.^p B) Two ways the student can improve the design and validity at the results is to state how much weight you  add every five minutes and what types of plastics were used for this experiment.
When looking at the students data I can conclude that plastic type A had the least stretchability reaching (10-12)mm. On the other hand plastic type B had the greatest amount of stretchability reaching (22-23)mm. Two ways the student could improve his experiment design is: 1 he could have used a control to have a more controlled experiment. 2 he could have done each plastic type with more intervals such as 10 minutes, 15 minutes, 20 minutes and so on. This would increase the validity of the results.
The student could have improved the experimental design or validity of the results by: 1. Having all plastic pieces be the same length. 2. Add the exact amount of weights to each new point of plastic.
Based on the students data I conclude that plastic type B has the greatest ability to stretch. The students could have improved their design by specifying the mass of the weights attached so the experiment can be repeated, and they could have done more trials, so they could have more confidence in their results.
a) Plastic type B is the stretchable polymer plastic. ^p b) The student should have specified a constant length to be used for each trial. Also, the students should have specified the weight being used.
A) 1 After looking at the students data their conclusion may be, Plastic type ''B'' stretches as the most because in T1 stretched 22 mm and on T2 it got 23. Comparing with the other plastic type which they lower tan 22 and 23. ^p B) Two ways the students could improved their experimental design are. ^p 1) Do it again. ^p 2) Compare their results with another group.
a.Based on the students' data it can be concluded that plastic type B stretched the farthest. It stretch 22mm in T1 and 23mm in T2.^p b.Two ways to improve the validity are to say how many pounds the weights are and to state the exact name of the plastics, and not just bathe them A, B, C, and D. This would make the experiment more accurate.
A) The students data shows that polymers B & D were the stretchiest while the plastic types A & C were not that flexible. B) The student could have improved his/her experimental design by using a control which he/she can compare the results to a plastic used. The student may also perform more trials in order to get an averge amount stretched (mm).
I say that type B plastic would work the best because it stretches more. One way the students could have made their experiment is could have used specific type of weights. ( We didn't know the weight of them). They could have also repeated the trials.
a.) It is evident that polymer D had the longest growth in length from start to finish in both trials. It is ultimately the most flexible/stretchable substance out of the 4 given in the experiment. ^p b) 1) The polymer should be attached with a sturdier applicant than tape. ^p 2.) The ammount of added weight should be specified.
"(A) In conclusion I think that the plastic type ""B"" stretched the most, and plastic ""A"" is the least stretchable. ^p (B) Two ways the students could have improven the experiment was by one telling us what type of plastic to use, and two, telling us how fare to hang it of the table,"
A conclusion that can be drawn from the data is plastic B is the strogest tape out of the other 3 plastics. (T1-T2, T2-T3) plastic D was the second strongest and plastic A was the weakest plastic and the second weakest was plastic C. Two way the student could have improved the experiment is by using tighter tape for tyding the plastic and act the 4 top plastic types in the wand.
Based on the data, I can conclude that plastic type D is the strongest of the four types tested. In order to improve experimental design or validity of the results the student could have specified and exact number or weights added to the clam, and the kind or weights and exact weight that he was adding to each piece of plastic. Also, he could have measured each piece or plastic exactly the same in order to be more precise.
A) Based on the students data plastic B is the most stretchability and plastic A is the less stretchable plastic. ^p B) In the students' experiment they could of stated exactly what was the measurement of the first type of plastic so they can repeat it acceratly for the other plastics. They could of also detemen the exact weigh of the clamp and how much wighed the wightes they add to get an more accerated result for the stretchability of the plastics.
The conclusion is there might have been some problems in the student's experiment. Some validity issuses could be that the five minutes the weights and clamps that had to hang could have not been a fuller exaxt 5 minutes. Also, the spot were the plastics were placed could not have been the same spot every time.
A) A conclusion that can be drawn based on this data is plastic type B has a higher stretchability than the other types of plastics. The independent variable is the type of plastic. The dependant variable is how far it can be stretched ^p B)The ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be to actually name the plastics and to tell us what the actual length was in the beginning. By telling us the name we could replicate this experiment better. By telling the length of the plastic in the beginning, we could see the change that occured.
a.) The conclusion of this experiment was to find the stretchability of different plastics. In the data results I found that plastic type B has the most stetchability of the four plastics in both trial 1, and trial 2. ^p B.) What were the weight of the weights that were used. How long was the length of the string that was attached to the weights.
Based on the results, plastic A is the least stretchable and plastic B is the most stretchable. The students could improve the experiment by giving the exact amount of weight to be used so that the experiment can be redone it needed. The student could also make each plastic sample the same starting length to rule out length as a variable.
My hypothesis was correct, the second trial didn't stretch the plastics further than the first trial. ^p One way the student could have improved the experiment would be describing the length of the plastics before being stretched. Second, the student could have also allowed the plastics to hang for a longer period of time to gather more accurate results.
Based on the following data on the polymer investigation, I can make a conclusion that the plastic D type is the most stretchy. Also the trials very similar but only average by 12 mm because the stretchyness. either increased or decreased. If a student were to complete this experiment all over again I would suggest that they change the way they set up the experiment because it was very complicated which leads to many errors. The students should also test the experiment 2 more times to see a range of results.
The conclusion that I have drawn from this expirament is that plastic type B was able to stretch the most. One way the student could have improved this experiment would have been they could have done a third trial to ensure the validity of the plastics' strechability. The student also could have been more specific in their procedure. They should have specified the plastic type to use in step one and say what measurement type to use in their experiment.
a.) Based on the data it seems type is amount stretched is the same. The other plastic types stretched differently on both trials. ^p b.) The students could run more trials to get a good result and they could measure the plastic after they put the clamps on the plastic and before they put the weights on.
A)What the data table shows is that plastic type A and B stretched additional length in trial second trial. Plastic C stretched length in trial two and D didn't stretch farther in trial two then one.^p (B)They can increase the number of trials for those experiment, furthermore they should give the exact amount of the weight the use for experiment using grams.
Based on this data i can conclude that plastic typ B was the most stretchable at 22mm the first trial and 23 mm the second trial. One way to improve the validity is to have more trials minimum 3. And another way to improve the validity is instead of timing, you should see how much weight it can hold before breaking by adding more weight at intervals.
Based on the students data, I can examin that plastic type D was prefarrened correctly because the 2 trials recorded the same length but plastic type B stretched farthest. Two ways the student could improve the experimental design/or validity is to create more trials to test the stretch and also state the weight size and make sure he put the exact weight measure for each plastic type and trial tested.
"According to the data shown plastic type B was the strongest and plastic type A was the least strongest. The groups' experimental design would of been positively improved if they include what plastic they were using instead of saying "" one type of plastic "" if the group included the original length of the plastic it would of much both their experiment and validity better."
Based on the student data it shows that T2 and T1 are showing that most of the experiments change on the second trial, and a couple stayed the same as the first trial. ^P The students could have improved their experiment by listing what the type of plastic is on the graph. They also showed have wieghed each weight to make sure they are all the same. They also could have hung the wights from the same distance on the plastic.
a) Plastic A stretched out the most with 2 mm. b) The student could have had another trial to test validity. And also have started out with the same length for every plastic.
A) Based on the table below I can infer that T2 stretched out more than T1. ^p B) Two way the student could have impral there exerimanta is is one thy could have gave how long the plastic was befor they stretched it so I can now the amount of the length stretched. Another thing word have to be is what they taped it the should of have used something more stronger lile another clamp for both end of th plastic and on each end.
The sample of plastic A stretch the least, meaning it was the strongest. The sample of plastic D stretch the most, meaning it was the weakest. ^P The student could have improve the experiment by having a control sample plastic A,B,C, and D, with no added weights. Another way to improve this experiment would be to have more trials for each kind of plastis.
In conclution, plastic type A and B did stretch but plastic type C got smaller and plastic type D stayed the same. ^p The student could have found another way to stretch the plastics. Their data could have been put clearer also.
In conclusion what all of the plastic type (A,B,C,D) stretched at least a milimeter per trial. Two ways the student could have improved the experiment was to have a controlled sample for each type plastic before they were stretched and the student should have been more specific about  what type of plastic they used.
A conclusion based on the student's data is that plastic type D was stretched the most. Two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design would be to vary the weights and amounts placed on the plastic, and to vary the time for  the trials.
Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic Type B is the most stretchable and sturdy polymer just because it stretched more than any of other plastic types in both trials. Two ways the students could have improved The experimental design and/or validity of the results would be by including in the procedure, the size of the weights used and the names of the different plastics incase another student wanted to replicate this experiment. Also he/she could have told us the starting size of the sample plastic prior to it being stretched
A. Plastic type 'D' had the most stretchability compared to the other plastics tested. ^p B. They should have been more specific about their mass (g) of the weights used. They should have also stated how long their plastic samples were at the beginning of the experiment, and how long after they were stretched.
Conclusion; plastics B+D stretch significantly more than plastics A+C. The students could have improved their design by starting with plastics of all the same length. They also should  named a common value for all the weights.
a. That substance B streached the fastest and then D, then C and finally A would streatch the least amount. ^p b. The student could have given the orginal length of the plastics. The student could have specified how much the clamp and the weigths weigthed.
A) From this data, it can be concluded that plastic type B is the most flexible because it has the longest length stretched in both trial 1 and 2 additionally. Plastic type A is the least flexible since it had the shortest length stretched in both trials. B) One way the experimental design could be improved is by adding more trials for each plastic because more trials lead to more accurate results. Additionally the design could show how much weight is used on each plastic because if the weights are not the same for each plastic and trial, the results are clearly not valid.
In conclusion type A is the strongest plastic and type B is the weakest plastic. ^P In this experiment they should have more trials than just 2. ^P They also should have put how much weight they used and if it was the same amount of weights.
The conclusion that was drawn was that plastic type (A) had the longest length after being stretched with weights. The students could have improved the experiment by having more than two trials, and also by being more specific about the amount of weights that were used.
Plastic type D is the most durable. It had the most amount stretched. The student should have wrote in the measurements of the before stretched length and how many weights to add when stretched.
a) Based on the results, plastie type A was the least flexible, while plastic type B was the most flexible. ^p b) 1) The student doesn't say where on the table to tape the tap edge of the sample. 2: The student uses samples with varying length, therefore making his results invalid.
My conclusion is that plastic type B stretch the farthest than the others. Two ways could of improved their experiments is adding more trials and adding weights to the bags.
According to the data, plastic B seems to have stretched the most, while plastic A stretched the least. ^p The experiment could be improved in two ways: The plastics' length was not constant and will affect the results. The plastics should be a set length. The weight of the weights should be specified so that others may similarly recreate the procedure.
A conclusion I can draw, based on the start ends data, is that plastic type B had stretched the most at the end of both trials. Also, I can draw the conclusion that type A stretched the least after both trials. 2 ways the students could have improved the experiment or validity of the results are to control variables and perform more trials. They could have improved the experiment by controlling the number of weights, type of clamp, and the height that the plastic hung from.
"a) One conclusion that can be made is that the strongest plastic is ""A"" because it stretched the least in both trials. b) One way the students could have improved this experiment would have been to also test a control. This experiment needs something to compare  to or else the results are not totally valid. Something else the students could fix is to be more specific in this procedure. Most of the procedure is very vague it would be quite different to try to re-perform this experiment with this procedure. For example, the procedure says: "" Add weights to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes"". The reader does not know the weight or size of the weights her does he know where to put them."
a) The conclusion has been drawn that plastic type B stretches the most.^p b) Two ways to improve this experiment would be be tell how long to cut each plastic and how heavy the weights should be.
I conclude that plastic type because the strogest  because it was the strongest the first and second trail. ^p They could have made none trails and add more weights on the plastic see how had it works.
Based on the students data i ca n say that plastic A was the strongest because it barely stretched. Two ways in which the experimental design/ validity of the results could have been improved were to label the plastics and in put the length of the plastic before it  was stretched.
a. Plastic type B stretched the most out of all the plastics. Therefore plastic type B is the weakest. ^P b. two ways the students could have improved their experiment is clampy how much weight is put on to the clamps. Also, they should do one more trial to make the experiment more accurate.
Based upon the students data, + displays that plastic type B is the most flexible compared to the other three types of plastic. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be to do the standard 3 trials, instead of two and also to further improve the student's validing of their results would be to record a before and after measurement as well as the averages to his table to make his more more clear or valid.
The plastic that stretched the most was B.^ This student could improve by recordin the amount of weight used and having the same amount of weight for each, they could have also added the length of the plastics to show.
The conclusion I can draw from based on the student's data is that A.B increased, while C decreased and D stayed the same. 2 ways the student could have improved the experiment is by 1st the way the decided to do the experiment. They should have checked to see if after the 1st trial if it would go back to its normal form. 2nd: They should have mentioned what the size was before the experiment was started.
Plastic D is concictast with how much it stretches state that they are using different plastics state the weight that was added.
"I conclude plastic polymer D has the most stretchability and polymer plastic A has the least stretchability. The student should have ran two test on each plastic with a brand new piece then averaged the totals together for (T1) and (T2) for each trial. The student also should have set how this piece of plastic is ""hanging freely"" that tells me nothing or how to repeat it."
a) My conclusion based on the students data is that plastic type B is the most stretchable because for both trials it stretched more than all the other plastic types. b) Two ways the student could have improved the design could be to specify how many weights they added to the clamp and they could of also used something sturdier stronger to hold down the plastic so it wouldn't come off the table.
a) Based on the student's data, plastic B stretched the most by 22-23 mm and plastic A stretched the least with about 11mm. Plastic had the second strongest stretchability with 20mm and then plastic with 13-14 mm.  b) The students could have improved the experiment by recording the average amount stretched. They also could have made sure all the plastics had same beginning length.
a. Plastic type A was mide of the least amount of polymers because it stretched the least, and plastic B was the most. ^p b. The students could have written the measurements of the plastics before they stretched them, and they also could have specified how much weight they held part on the clamps.
a) According to the results, T2 had stretched the most mm than T1.^p B) The student should have said how big the clamp should have been, and how heavy the weights should have been.
Plastic type B stretched the most of all. They should have specified the mass of the weights used.
Based on the data I can include that plastic B has the most strechability. It had the most streching for both the first and second trial, 22mm and 23 mm. To improve this experiment I would specify how much weight used in each type of plastic and I'd make that a controled variable. I would also include the length of the plastic before it was stretched so I can get a better idea on how stretchable the plastic really is
A) Based on the data I have seen, plastic B seemed to be stretched out the most, meaning it's too durable. And plastic A seemed to be stretched out the least, meaning it's more durable. ^p B) One way to improve this experiment is by telling us the amount of weight the student added to the clamp. Also, to get better results the student should've conducted a third trial.
Based on the data that is recorded is that they are different here of them had the same length when starting and plastic A stretched the most. ^p This students could  improve this experiment by having the four sample all the same length also to could at told us how much the weights should be and should not change.
a.) Plastic type B stretched the furthest with 22 mm on T1 and 23 mm on T2. Plastic type A stretched the least with 10mm on T1 and 12mm on T2. ^p b.) One way would to have the same starting length for each plastic. A second way would be to use different weights that weigh more or less.
Plastic A was the strongest of the 4 plastics as it stretched the least while plastic D was the weakest as it stretched the most. ^P One way the students could of had a better experiment is to do more trials as it would give more precise data. The second way to improve the experiment would be to try the plastics in different conditions such as heat or cold to see if that affects the strength.
"Well the ""T2"" was higher except for ""C"" ^p The student could have told us how much time we have in between before we check again."
(A) Based on the students data it shows that plastic type B is the best choice because it stretched up to 23mm which is farther than the others. ^p (B) The two ways that they can make the experiment better are adding more trials, and adding more controls to make sure that everything is constant.
A) When testing our hypothesis whe had came to a conclusion. It seems to be that when we tested the plastic type by stretching it we had found out that when stretched a second time the numbers seemed to have went up and then on plastic type D it stood at 20. ^P B) The students could have improved their experimental design if they would have told us what types of plastic they had used. Also, they could have added how many times they did both trials.
Plastic B was the most stretchable .It stretched 22 mm that and 23mm that 12 plastic A was the least stretchable.It only stretched 10mm in Trial 1 and 12mm in trial 2.Plastic D was the 2nd stretchiest with 20mm in the first trial and 20mm in the 2nd trial. And  plastic C was the 3rd stretchest with 14mm in the 1st and 2nd 13mm in the 2nd trial to improve the experiment they could have used the same length of plastic preceding the stretching.
Plastic Type D stretched the most but on the second trial plastic Type A made the most difference. To improve this project the student could have hung the plastic from a higher surface to see if gravity would stretch it more. Also, the student could have put weights in the middle of the plastic to test if its middle would stretch more and be more durable.
Based on the data, plastic B is the most stretchable and plastic A is the least stretchable. ^p The students could have improved their experimental design and validity by attatching the clamp to the same place each time. The also should have had a control, which woud have been the plastic with the weights.
The plastic that streched the most would be plastic type A because it went from 10 to 12 when the others increased by one or none at all. The students could've tested more plastics, or use a different method to strech the plastic.
In conclusion, according to the results of the experiment, On the other hand plastic type A had the least amount of stretchability leaving plastic types C and D somewhere in between them. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment would be testing each plastic type one or two times for more reliability. On the student could have tested more plastic types or added different weights.
(A) Plastic type A had the most resistance it did not rip that much especially compared to plastic type B. ^P (B) Instead of letting them hang for 5 minutes make it less to be more effective.
My conclusion is that plastic type D is best because the amount stretched stayed the same throughout test trial 1 and test trial 2. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is allow the weights to hang longer than 5 minutes, and or add a heavier weight.
a) Some plastics could stretch alot more than others. Plastic B stretched the most. ^p b. The students could added different weights on it and see if that changed the results.
According to the student's data plastic types B seems to be the most stretchable and plastic type A seems to be the most durable. I think they should have done a third trial and specified a certain weight amount.
(A) Based on the data, plastic material A was the most durable out of the four tested. This is because plastic A only stretched 10mm on the first trial, and 12 on the second, while plastic B stretched 22 & 23mm, plastic C 14 and 13, and plastic D 20 each time. This means that plastic A tolerated the weight on the clamp the best, and also that plastic B tolerated it the least. ^p (B) The students could have improved their experiment by using a variety of different weights to get a wider range of data, and by doing more trials to allow for the most accurate data possible.
I think they should of kept the time the same because on this chart the times are differnt then the original time. So deffentally improve by keeping the time same.
a) After viewing the data, it is clear that type B has the greatest stretchability with 22mm and 23mm, compared to type A's 10 mm and 12 mm. Also type D is the most accurate because 20 mm was reached in both trials. ^p b) This student can improve the design by specifying how many of what amount weight he used. This will give him more control over the experiment. Also, he should have a control plastic to compare the results of the others to. The control should be either stretchable or very durable.
My conclusion is that plastic type is going to be more long because it look as if the student added more weight to it. The student could have improve this assignment by stating spicifically how much weight to add to the clamp, also this experiment could of been more successful if the student had different type of plastic sample to measure.
Conclusion type B of the plastic was the least strong and stetches the most type of was the strongest and only stetched about mm. Two wats the student could of improve the experimental disen would have more trials and what is the length of the plastic.
The conclusion based on the students data shows that with the same weights but different types of plastic are different. The students could have added more trials and added more weight to there experiment.
Conclusion : Type D plastic has more stretchability because the a mount stretched is 20: T1 & 20: T2. On the first step the should be more specific for the type of plastic. & for the fift step should include in what direction to measure the plastic type after re moving the weights.
In conclusion, plastic type B has the most stretchability. One way to improve the experimental design is to make sure the, same amount of weight is used for each plastic. Another way to improve the experimental design is to run another trial.
A. Plastic type A was 11mm that had changed the most. From trial 1 to trial 2 it had increased by a going from 10 to 12. ^p B: One way the students could ad improved they're experiment is by doing more track. Another way the students could ad improved there experiment is by adding heavyer weights to the bags.
A) A conclusion that I can draw from the student's data is that plastic type B stretched the most. I know this is accurate because during the second trial it come to be about the same. ^p B) To ways the student could have improved the experiment are ^p 1) He/she should have added how much each weighed and 2) He/she should have put the lengths of the plastics before they were stretched in her data.
Considering the plastic was already stretched. It wasn't as strong as it should of been on the second trial. The student could of told how long the plastic was before it was stretched. He could of also told how heavy the weights were.
The way they could had improved the experimental design or the validity results is by adding more to it to make it higher than it is.
I conclude that all plastic type stretchability is good except D. The students could had improved the experimental design by all of the plastic being known in prior knowledge that it would stretch. Another way would be that they could of see how much of something it could hold.
Plastic types And C were stiffer while types B and D stretched more. This student could have supposed this experiment by adding a third trial for more accurat data and by adding the original length of each peice of plastic to table that he  made. The original length would better the understanding of the data by whoever is reading the table because they would be able to see what length the plastic started at.
1 way this student could have improvert this experiment B by doing more trials so their results done out better. Also they could have hung the weights for a longer period of time.
In conclusion trial any
The amount of stretched in T1 and T2 nie was a little different, T2 was greater than T1 in plastics A,B and C, but in plastic D they had the same amount of stretched. ^p What the student shoud do to improve his experiment is to add more trials.
Based on the results of the experiment, plastic type B had the least overall stretch. Although the groups results are not valid. There are two ways to improve the experiment in an experiment, you should always construct 3 trials to validate your results also, all of the samples should be exactly the same length.
A) Plastic B stretched the most out of all therefore plastic B has the greatest level of stretchability.^p B) The studen could have changed the tested variable the 2nd trial or he/she could have preformed an additional trial.
To improve the validity of the trial, the student could add another trial for each of the plastic strips. To improve the experimental design, the student should mention the exact amount of the weights used on the plastic.
Based on the student's investigation, I conclude that plastic types B and D are weaker polymers than plastic types A and C. Both B and D stretched much farther than A and C, which indicates that their polymer chains are not as strong. This student could improve the experimental design by using the same length of each sample to ensure that it is not a variable. Also, the student cold have used a set number of weight to make sure each sample was stretched by exactly the same forces.
Conclusion: There was a small difference between the first and second trial for each plastic. The student could have improved the validity by doing a third trial. They could of improved the experimental design by stating how much each weighted weighed.
Plastic B is the stretchiest plastic. It stretched the most out of both trials than all the other plastics. ^p The student could have specified what weight to use, so each plastic is being pulled with by the same weight. Different weights would affect accuracy negatively. The student also would have made sure the initials were of the same condition before being tested. For example, if a plastic was heated before the test it would stretch much more than a plastic that was cooled lastly. The student could make sure each test was in same environment.
B) One thing they could've improved on would be the description on the steps, explain it more with detail. Another thing the students could work on would be to define the control. ^p A) Polymer Investigation.
a) My conclusion is that plastic B was the stretchiest. ^p b) To improve experimental design and validity, the student should have specified how much weight he used to put on the ends of the clamps to stretch the plastic. Also, there should have been a control to compare the results to at the end. Also, there should have been a third trial so the experiment would be more valid.
The conclusion
a) A conclusion of this procedure would indicate the plastics durbility to a certain amount of weight and which if the plastics is more durable or unstretched than the others. ^p b) One way the students could have improved the experimental design would be stating the types of plastic used. Another way would be by determining how heavy the weights were on the clamps.
In conclusion, based on these lab results plastic type B was stretched the farthest where Plastic A was stretched the least. One thing the student should do to improve their experimental design was list what kind of plastics they were instead of just naming them plastic A, plastic B etc. Also to improve their validity of the experiment they should have done twice trial to make sure that the first type trials were right.
A conclusion of the student's rest of stretchability on polymers is, plastic type B is the stretchiest because it stretched out the most out off all the other plastics. Plastic type A would be the least stretchiest because it stretched out the least out of all the other plastic types. 2 ways the students could have improved the results are; increase the number of plastics being tested so that you have more results; are increase the number of plastics being tested so that you have more results, The second way is add more weights when stretching out the plastics so you can see how they react under more weight pressure.
According to this data table plastic type B has the best stretchability than the stretchability of plastic type A. ^p B. Torbe more accurate say how much the weight weighs and that you have been using the same for the same amount of time. Also, make sure that the student is using the same amount of each plastic.
The type stretched out differently depending on how much weight was put on them.
Plastic polymer D has the most stretchability. It is more durable. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design an validity of the results, would be to have a few more trials and test the plastics for 10 minutes.
In conclusion plastic type D based on our data stretched the most and plastic type A stretched the least. Type D stretched 20 for both trials while type a stretched10 for TI and 12 for T2. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is to do another trial. Also to average the data out.
a.) A conclusion based on the students data that they found out plastic type B was the best kind of plastic in this experiment and plastic Type A was the strongest. ^p b.) Two ways the student could have improved the experiment was to add more trials because 2 isn't enough and to tell us what to measure the length of the plastic with.
A) The conclusion I can conclude from the data is that plastic B stretched the farthest, in both of the trials. ^P B) More trials. ^P Add another type of plastic.
a)Plastic type B has the greatest stretchability, it stretched 22 and 23mm in both trials, while the other plastics stretched between 10 and 20 mm. ^p (b)The students could improve this experiment by adding more trials and by measuring mass of the weights.
In this lab a student investigated the stretchability of four different polymer plastics: A, B, C and D. After two trials of each polymer the student concluded that plastic type B had the most stretching strength out of all that were tested. Two ways the student could have improved this experimental design was to make sure the tape that was holding the type of plastic was secure enough to withstand the weight of the clamps and other weights. Another improvement could have been to measure how much of the plastic you tape down.
a) Plastic type b was the only polymer plastic that was able to stretch out the most while plastic type A was the only polymer plastic that did not stretch out a lot. ^p b) One way that the student could have improved the experimental design would be to state how many weighs to add on the clamp. Another way that it could've been improved was to do more trials.
"A conclusion to be drawn is plastic type B is the most strechy and plastic A is the strongest. Two ways to improve the experiment would be not say ""exatly"" and instant say ""repeat steps"" and to keep the length and width of the plastics constant"
"a) A conclusion that I can draw based on the students data is that plastic ""B"" stretches alot more then any of the other plastics and plastic ""a"" is the least stretchy. I know that because plastic B's lowest trial was trial 1 with 22mm stretched whitch  higher than any of the others on the data table. Also plastic ""a's"" highest was in trial 2 at 12mm stretched and that the lowest on the board (besides its own t1). As you can see the conclusion I drew and why it is an accurate one. B.) Two ways it could have been improved was by - doing 3 trials bc the more trials the more accurate the experiment is and you're supposed to do 3. - he should have allowed the them to hang for more then 5 minutes in step 4. This way it will have more time to stretch."
Based on the student's data, the order of stretchability for the plastic types from greatest to least is B, D, C, A. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design/validity of the results would've been to use the same clamp for all the experiments and to use the same amount of weights.
A conclusion I can draw is that plastic type B can be streched the most at 22 mm. Plastic type A was the weekest stretched at 10 mm. ^p Two ways are do a control and do it for a longer time.
Both plastic types B and D stretched out of all the plastic types. He could have listed all materials first. Also he could have timed longer.
The purpose for this experiment was to investigate which of four polymer plastics is best in terms of stretchability. According to the data table, plastic type B is higher regarding stretchability having the most mm's  in trial 1(22mm) and trial 2 (23 mm) while the least stretchable is plastic A having 10 mm in trial 1 and 12 mm in trial 2. Two way of improving result validity would be by testing not just stretchability but abrasion and other technique, 2) increasing the amount of trial for greater data.
According to the data, plastic type D was most likely a hard type of plastic such as a water bottle or milk jug because it didn't stretch at all. Two ways the student could have improved the experiment would be to add the constant of how much weight was added. This is necessary so each plastic is being tested the same. A second way to improve the experiment is to use the same amount of plastic to make each trial more valid and similar.
Plastic type B was the most stretchiest (22&23) & plastic type A stretched the least. Plastic type C (A&B) stretched the second least while plastic type D stretched the second most and was constant with 20mm. The students could have improved the design by creating more trials for more valid results. More trials can show a trend in the data while only two can't. The students also should have clarified how much the weights should weigh when added and when to add them to the clamp.
After reading the recorded data from the investigation I can conclude that out of plastics A,B,C, and D plastic A and B both increased in milemeters opposed to C which decreased after the second trial while plastic D stayed the same during both trials. One way the student could have improved the experimental design would be by leaving the the clamps on the plastic for longer that 5 minutes, another would be to perform  a third trial.
Plastic type B is the most stretchable with 22mm and plastic type A is the least stretchy, it only stretched 10mm. However in order for this experiment to be more valid you would have to keep the amount of weight and the length of each plastic the same if you were to do this, then you cold get a more accurate data.
A. Based on the data I conclude plastic D is the stretchiest type of plastic. In both trials the plastic stretched the same amount (20mm) ^p B. One way the students could have improved the experiment was to record anything that went wrong.  Another way was to create a graph.
My conclusion from the data is that A streched 2mm, B streched 1mm, C streched 1mm and D stayed the same at 20mm. ^p Name the plastic being used. Add how much each plastic streched.
Based on the students data, plastic type B is the stretchiest. One way they could have improved their experimental design is by creating a controlled length for each of the plastic types. Another way they could have improved the validity of the experiment is by adding more trials, because by performing more trials, flukes will not greatly affect the data.
Based on the student's data you can tell that on plastic type A and is continue to expand after they are streched a second time, while plastic type C and D do not. The student could have improved the experimental design by specifying how more weights they added to the plastic and adding a 3rd trial. Those 2 improvements would clear up everything in the experiment.
A conclusion based on the table is that plastic type B was the strongest because stretched very much and it did not break. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is specify how much weight to add to the plastics, and tell us how long the plastic samples should be.
Conclusions drawn from this experiment is that plastic type D had stretched the most and is most flexible. While plastic type A had stretched the least and is the least flexible. The student could have stated what the types of plastic were though. So instead of seperating them by letters, who'd know exactly what they are. He should of also said how heavy the weights would be and made sure they were all kept the same weight.
a) The type of plastic that stretched the highest amount of mm was plastic type B with a total of 45 mm. The record trial was more than the first trial as shown on the data table. ^p A way that the student could have improved the experimental design could be to stretch the plastic with your hands. A second way would be to wait more than five minutes to take the clarops off.
"Based on the results from the data table, the two trials do not differ much but the second trial had a couple longer length, so something could have been done differently from the first trial. The data should that plastic B stretched the farthest during the first trial and that it is the ""stretchiest"" the way the student could have improved the design or validity of the results is to repeat it 2 more trials exactly like before to ensure the results are accurate. A second way the student could have improved the experimental design is to say how much weight to add to each plastic, instead of just saying changed."
a) In conclusion,plastic (B) streched the most endeng with a total of 45mm of streched plastic the least effective plastic in strechability was plastic (A),only streching a total of 22mm. b) (1) keep the amount of weights constant at a specific measurement.(2) Measure the plastics making them all the exact same size with specific numbers.
Based on the students data I conclude that plastic type B stretched the most after five minutes. Plastic type A stretched the least. The students should of told us how many weights to add to the clamp and how much each weight Weighed. They also should of told us what type of plastic they were using.
Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design  or validity of the results is they could be more specific  and could of wrote a conclusion saying which plastic type has more stretchability instead of drawing a data table. To show how much a the stretchability of each plastic.
Based on the student's data plastic B and D stretched almost  twice as much as A and C so therefore, B and D are most likely made of branched chain polymers whereas A and C are made of linear polymers.The student could have  improved his or her procedure by clarifying where exactly the plastic were tape on the table in order to keep the data constant. If the tape was slightly higher we for some plastic this and have affected the data.The student should also clarify where  to put the clamp on the plastic for the same reasons.
a) Plastic type B has the most tensile strength and plastic type A hav the least tensile strength. b) The student could have added a control and specified how much weights were added.
a) Based on this data the students can conclude that plastic B is the stretchiest sample. ^P b) Two ways the students could improve their experiment would be to use a fresh sample for each trial, & they could also ad the same weight consistantancy for each sample.
The conclusion is that type b plastic will stretch the furthest. ^p How much weight to rise. ^p Did a third trial.
Based on the data table plastic. Types A, B, C and  D. Plastic A was the weakest because it stretched 22 mm to 23 mm. The student could have made this experimental better if the do more trail and the temperature of the plastic.
Plastic type B is the polymer plastic with the highest stretchability because in both trials it had stretched the most. this experiment is not very valid because the different polymer plastics started at different lengths which may have an effect on how much it stretches. Also, the measure of the weights weren't specified.
a. Plastic type A was the most streachable of all plastics tested.^b.One way the students could improve the experamental design and validity of the results is if they repeated the test on each plastic several times to ensure their results were correct. Another way that they could improve the design is if they specified amount of weight added to the clamps, then did trials with a different amount of weight.
A) If you tape a plastic sample to a table and attach a clamp with weights on the bottom then plastic type C will stretch the longest because it is the thickest out of all the plastics. ^p B) Two ways the student could improve was to add more trials and make sure to use the same amount of weights for each plastic.
a) The plastic that is most stretchable is plastic B, and the least stretchable is plastic A. ^p b) The student could have put the original length of the plastic into his table without the original length, it is actually impossible to see which one stretched the most. Plastic D looks like it stretched a lot according to the graph, but its original length could have been 20. The length of the plastic samples should also be the same. If there is one sample that is shorter than the others, the results will not be accurate.
a) The conclusion to my investigation is at the end of my investigation plastic D came out even in the second trail for (T1) and (T2) when stretch. ^P b) Two ways the students could have improved the experiment is by telling us what plastic to use. For example, plastic bottle or wrap. Also, telling us how long do they want the plastic stretched.
A. Plastic type A stretched the least out of the others in both trials. Plastic type is stretches the most in both trials. The student did not have a control variable.^P The student could have measured each plastic before adding weights to make a controll each plastic type had to be the same length. Could have done more trials to make the experement more valid
"a) Plastic type B is the most stretchable.^p b). Make sure to say what kind of tape is being used; scotch tape would be too weak. Also, when saying ""perform a second trial (T2) exactly like the first trial (T1), it can't be exactly the same. You have to  use new samples of each type of plastic (A, B, C +D)."
Based on the experiment's data the plastics A through C stretched up & down. However plastic type D did not change at all in both trials. Plastic A's amount of stretching went up by 2. Plastic B's stretching amount went up by only one. Plastic type C also only went up by 1. The students could have improved the experiment by having more tests & having a control.
A conclusion for this experiment is that there must have been a possible error somewhere making the data unreliable. This is because the results are inconsistant. ^p One way the student could have improve the experiment is to have done more trials. Another way the student could have improve the experiment is to measure the exact weight put on the clamp.
In this investigation the conclusion is that plastic type B stretched the most in both trials. As you can see in the data table plastic type B stretched 22mm in the 1st trial. In the second trial plastic type B stretched 23mm. Plastic type A stretched the least in both trials. In the first trial plastic type A stretched 10mm and in the second trial it stretched 12mm. Two ways that this lab could have been improved would be to wait longer than 5 minutes to have them stretched and to make sure they are the same length.
Based on the students data plastic type D stretched the most which means it is probably made of weaker polymers. Plastic type A stretched the smallest amount which means it is made of the strongest polymers. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design or validity of the results are to measure how thick in width each of the plastic strips were before and after the experiment, and to describe the difference in texture (if any) of each plastic.
a) Plastic B stretched more than plastics A,C & D when weights are added to it. ^p 1. How much weight was added. 2. What do they measure length in.
A. From looking at the data plastic type B in trial one and two seem to be the strongest when weight was added to them. ^p B. The students could have improved the experiment by stating what type of plastic they were using for each. They also could have been a little more clear on some of their steps.
During this experiment, it was proven that plastic sample A was the most durable, as it only moved between 10-12mm. The most flexible however, was plastic sample B. It stretched between 22-23mm. To improve the validity of this experiment, I would reccomend  specifying the amount of weight to add to the clamp. So that it can remain constant throughout the experiment.
Type plastic B stretched the longest in (t1) to (T2) having measurements of 22 to 23. Ways the students could improve their design adding measurement of which to clamp weights and how heavy the weights are.
I a conclusion based on the students data, is that plastic D streched the same amount at 20mm for trial 1 & trial 2. But plastic B streched the most. For trials 1&2 at 22mm for trial 1, and 23mm for trial 2.
In conclusion plastic type D was the most strechable (streched 20mm) and A was the least (streched 10mm). Therefor type D would be the best choice. The design could be improved by adding a controlled, and by adding the new much the weights were.
"a)Our hypothesis was collect that plastic type would stretch the farthest because it is the most durable.^p (b)One way to improve their design was to add more to step seven like ""repeat steps 1-6 with new pieces of plastic""."
A) A conclusion based on the students data is that plastic type B is the most stretchable whereas type a is the least and is more resiliant.^p B) Two ways to improve the validity include adding a third because the data is different in the first 2 and a third would confirm accuracy a little more. Also contrats should be outlined such as keeping the original plastic samples. The same size before stretching specifying what meraments to go up by in weight added and specific amount of weight to add must be the same.
In the conclusion of the experiment plastic type B stretched the most to 22 mm to 23 mm. While I thought plastic type A streched the least 10 & 12 mm. Two ways that these students can improve their experimental design would be having more variables controlled such as how much weight to put on to the clamps. Also, the students got include the starting size of the plastics so it is hard to conclude any of their data.
(a) My conclusion in this experiment would be that plastic type B has the most stretchability out of all the polymers tested. In both trials, it had the most amount stretched, trial 1 it was stretched 22mm and trial 2 was stretched 23mm. (b) The student could have improved the experimental design in two ways by having a control and by including constant variables. The control would serve as a reference point to the rest of the data and constant variables would have made it so no other variables were affecting the results of the experiments.
I can conclude that plastic type B is the stretchiest because it stretched to 22 and 23mm. ^p The student could specify the amount of plastic that was hanging over the edge. The student could also say how much weight he was using.
In conclusion plastic type B has the highest stretchability while type A has the lowest. One way that the student could have improved the experiment would be to have a specific weight such as 1 1b, 2 1b, 3 1b. Another way would be to add one more trial so as to prove or show better more valid results.
One conclusion that can be drawn is that plastic type B stretched the most (22 mm and 23 mm) out of all the plastics. Also, plastic type A stretched the least, only stretching to 10 mm and 12 mm. This is a conclusion that can be drawn. ^p To improve the validity of the experiment, the students could name the four plastics used. Also to have accurate data, the kids should have set a measurement at which to cut all the plastics instead of saying ''measure its length''. Also adding a control would be helpful as well. This is how the students could improve the validity of their experiment.
A conclusion that can be drawn from these student data could be that plastic type D appears to be the most reliable, or stretchs the most. Two ways these students could have improved their design is they could have done more trials and also they could have kept adding weights and see where plastic broke first. and which held out the longest  could have been the strongest.
My conclusion about the students data would be the farthest amount stretched he recorded one thing I would have done would be to change the plastic to which is more durable and Add T3 so their can be more results.
a) Based on the data, plastic type B stretched the most during trial 1 and trial 2, the least stretchable plastic was plastic type A. Type C was not very stretchable, and plastic D was the second most flexible. ^p To ensure accuracy of the experiment. ^p The student could have revealed the weight added to each plastic in the table, to make sure that it was constant and also could have measured after a longer amount of time.
a) Based on the students data and the 2 trials. The experiment seems to be very valid and accurate. ^p b) One way to improve this experiment I believe would be a third trial run, only because plastic type A was 2mm away from the first trial which doesn't give you a great conclusion. And another way I would change this would be explain better. Its very confusing and not specific, how much were the weights etc.
If I look four plastic cups and taped them from the side of the table and place different contents such as weights. Then the plastic cups will stretch. Based on my results my hypothesis was correct because trial 1 and trial 2 shows that the plastic cups had stretched. For example, plastic type A stretched 10mm in trial1 after adding weights to the clamp and letting it hang for five minutes. They could have improved the this experiment by giving the length of the cup before the cup and then they could have just measured it again and see what it was after. For example before 30 after 40. They also could of improved this experiment by doing more trials to show the accuracy of the experiment.
Based on the students data you, can conclude that plastic B was the stretchiest of all the plastics. If the students are to conduct the experiment again, they could improve their experimental design by using heavier weights and also doing more trials.
"In conclusion to this data, I think plastic type B is the most flexible type of plastic. Also, plastic type A is the least flexible. ^p The students can improve their experiment by explaining how much of each plastic they should measure. For example, step 1 should say: ""Take 5cm of one plastic type."" Also, they could improve it by adding the weight of the clamp and letting it sit for longer than 5 minutes."
After looking at the data I can conclude that plastic was D was the stronger the plastic because it stayed the same length. ^p B. two ways they could have improved the job is by first stating what type of plastic you are using and by saying how much weight you have to the clamp.
a)From viewing data from me polymer investigation, it shows that plastic type B truly has the most stretchability, because it stretched the most out of all the polymers at average of 22.5 mm.^p (b)The experimental design would have better if adopt a trial 3, then the accuracy would go up. Another thing that you could have done was specified how much weight your adding, and if its the same amount for all plastics.
I conclude that plastic type D didn't stretch all all because the (mm) length hasn't changed. One way they could have improved the experiment is by telling us kind of plastic they used. Another way is that they could have told us how heavy the weights were that they were using.
In the conclusion, the plastic strech out longest in T2 the T1. ^P The way they could of make there expriment better is by ading more weght every jeswon with the same timty.
According to the students data plastic type B is the strongest. Two ways the student could have improved the experiment design validity of the results were. By stating the length and type of each plastic . The student hover clarified the length of each btn p of plastic. Another thing, the student should have done is stated how much weight to hang off of each strip of plastic and if it was the same each time.
A conclusion I draw based on their data is that plastic type D is the most durable and strongest plastic. It didn't change in either trial. An improvement the students could have done made was recording the original lengths of the plastics before it went through the test. Also, they could have recorded the amount of weight they added to the clamp in order to see what caused the plastics to stretched. Validity of the results could have been to long or short of time to allow the plastics to hang.
According to the students data, type B polymer plastic stretched the furthest. The students could have improved this experiment by adding more trials and more sure that in step 2 that all the plastic samples were changing freely down the side of the table evenly by measuring the parts taped.
The weights and clamp and measure the length of the plastic.
The student used different plastic to determine its stretchability. She took a sample of one of the plastic & measured, she added weights on the plastic to see how far it would on.
A plastic B is more stretchable than plastic A, C and D. The student didn't mess up anywhere during the expierement otherwise there would be a bigger gape on the strecbility between two trials. ^p B The student should use the same amount of weights for each plastic and should have done a third trial.
A) A conclusion I could come up with in this experiment is that plastic type B has stretched 22-23mm which makes it the most stretched but out of the 4 they tested in both trials. While plastic type A had the least stretchability at 10 & 12mm. B) Two ways the students could have improved this experiment is they should have done at least 3 or more trials to better the information given. They also should have made sure in step 2 that each plastic was hanging off the table at the same length so it would be a fair way to measure at the end.
Plastic type B has the most stretchability during both trials. Plastic type A had the least amount of stretchability in both trials. The student could have explained how the plastic stayed on the table if there were weights attached. Also what kind of table the experiment took place on.
Based on the student's data both plastics type A and B has increased in T2, type C has dicreased in T2 and type D stayed the same. ^p Two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design is add more control and make more trials.
In conclusion, scene within the data toble plastic type b was most durable in being stretched. making plastic b have the most stretchability. This expirement could of been improved by having a control of how far each plastic could be streached with out weights, secondly they could have told us in the ditecting and in use smaller weight or larger weights, and actual length sizes so the expirerment could be done right.
One way the student could have imomised the experiment is to try the trials more than once.
a) Based on the exploits data, plastic type A stretched the farthest from trial 1 to trial 2 and plastic type B shrinkid from
Plastic
a) Plastic type b stretched the furthest out of the grap. ^p b) give the specific name of the plastics used tell us what size weights to use.
A conclusion is that plastic type A is the strongest plastic because once the weight was taken off the plastic didn't stretch that much. ^p ^p A way they could have improved there experiment is that they could have said how heavier the weights were also, they could have made each plastic the same length before adding weights.
a)Based on the data,plastic D had the greatest stretchability with an over age of 20mm streched.This was much greater than plastic A, which had the lowest average amount stretched which was 11mm. Plastic B and C tell in the middle .^p b) One way the students could have improved the experiment design would to specify the amount of weights used and make sure it was the same each time.The students should also specified how to hang the plastics off the table so that the same amount was on the table as was hanging off.
based on the students data I can conclude that the second time the trial was done the amount that the plastic types stretched was greater than that of trial one except for type C which it shrink 1mm from 14 to 13 in trial 2. Two ways they could have made this experiment better is if they were specific on how much weight was used, and if in the chart they included the amount of time that each plastic type hong.
The first thing the students should improve the experiment design is instead of attaching clamps to the bottom of the plastic sample they should use small boots to it. Then the second thing they should  is do more trials to the experiment because they probaly won't be happy with the data they already got so I would say do more trials and they might get better results.
A conclusion based on the data is that all the plastic types have ranged around the same number. Two ways the experiment could have been approved is for the different plastic types let the weight hold longer than five minutes. And change the trials.
a. Plastic B stretch the furthest and therefore had the most elasticity ( stretchability). Plastic A was the least stretchy. These results were most likely due to the combination of polymers in each plastic controlling their physical attributes. ^p b. One way the student could have improved the experimental design originally  is by stating how long the plastic should be cut to be. So 25 to make the experiment uniform. He should have increased this in his table so people could see how the lengths changed. Then he should have specified how much weight to add to the clamps for consistency.
"a) A conclusion to the experiment could be that ""plastic type B was able to be stretched the most (22mm, 23mm) when compared to the stretchability  of the after three plastics. ^P b. One way the students could have improved the experiment would be to add in the conclusion the amount of weight they add up to each tag. They could have improved validity by adding another trial."
From the students data you can tell that plastic type A has the best stretchability. Plastic type B and C were the second best stretchability. Also that type D hold no sort of stretchability but could have tried more times to yield better results or they could have told us how much weight did they put on for each clamp for each plastic.
My experiment concludes that out of the four plastic polymers, plastic type B was the stretchiest while plastic type A was the least stretchy. My hypothesis on how the plastic would stretch was correct because I know that plastic type B immediately seemed stretched than other plastic types. The students could have improved their experiment by using a constant length for the plastic and using a contrast weight to stretch it with.
A: The conclusion is that the plastic type B in the second trial stretched the most to 25mm.^p B: The could have added a third trial and control variables.
Looking at the student's data, you can see that plastic type B has the best stretchability. The bag stretched 22 and 23 mm, that is more than any other bag in the two trials. The students could have done one more trial to justify their results. Also, they could have used a different amount of weight.
After testing four different polymere plastics. Plastic type A,B,C.D for their stretchability based on the data table plastic type A stretched 10mm, 11 and 12 mm. T2 plastic B stretched 22mm,T1 and 23mm.T2 plastic C stretched 14 mm 11 and 13mm, T2 and plastic D stretched 20 mm 11and 20 mm T2. Showig me that plastic B has the most stretchability and plastic A has the least.Two ways the student could have improved the experiment was including a control to have something to compare the stretchability of the plastics to, and state what each plastic was.
a) My hypothesis, that plastic type B would stretch the most was correct. B stretched on average 22.5 mm, while the other three ranged from 10-20mm. If I need a plastic with the largest stretchability, I would choose B. ^p b) The experiment would be more valid if I started with the same amount of each substance before doing the trials and it would also be more valid if I complete one or two more trials.
Plastic B is the most stredechable and A is the least stredachable.^p They should vary the weights they had on this elome and also allow them to hens for longer.
(A) According to the students data. The conclusion I can draw is that plastic B had the most strechability it stretched 22 mm in trial one and 2mm in trial two second was plastic d it's strechability was 20mm for both trials and the least stretchabilty was plastic A with 10 in trial one and 12 in trial 2. (B) could have done more trials to compare data to and make trials to compare data to and make sure that each piece of diffrant plastics were the same size.
Based on the students data the plastic A streched the least, and the plastic type B streached the most, something that could have the experiment better is count how many weights are placed on the clamp. This experiment is not valid because the number of weights isn't given. Another thing that could have been done is tell whether the plastic broke or not.
A. With the student's data you can tell that trials aren't that much different in the amount stretched. ^p B. Two ways the student could have improved the results was add less weight, another thing is let it hang longer.
"The students could conclude that plastic ""B"" has the most stretchability, because it stretched the farthest distance every time.The experiment could have been improved by making all the original pieces of plastic the same length. Also they could have used a control for comparison."
It has come to my conclusion that plastic letter B is the strongest. Plastic B showed that it has the strongest by consecutivley stretching the most. ^P B) First I would have don 3 trial because that always renders a more exccurat result than 2. Second I would mak sure all the plastics war the same length.
a) Each trial was very close to the same answer as the other one, so it, poves my validity, and shows that the weights does stretch out the plastic.^p b) The student needs to say how long the plastic was before the experiments. He should also have the weight of the weights listed somewhere.
According to the students data the conclusion that plastic. Type A stretched the most. The student could of improved the experiment by making sure that all the plastics were the same length. Another way he/she could of improved the experiment is by doing is third trial (T3), every experiment that is being investigated should have a third trail (T3) in order to get the correct results.
Plastic types B and D stretched significantly father than A and C. This allows us to infer they have weaker bonds making them more succeptible to stretching. One way the data would have been to write down the initial length of the plastic, also record the initial weight. This way we have more information to base our conclusion off of.
a) When the experiment was finnish the data showed that the four different polymer plastics for stretchability didn't have different results. The amount the four plastic types stretched in test one and test two were almost the same. ^p b) Two differnt ways the student could have improved the experimental design and validity would of bein adding time for the weight to work.
The students data shows that plastic type B hold the most weight and that plastic type A held the least. I think that the student would have added more trials and recorded the average of the trials. he also should have waited until the plastic bioler to record the data instead of waiting for it to get to a certain length. another thing that could have been done is use less time. The student waited five minute before adding another weight when they could have just added until the plastic ripped.
A) The student can conclude that plastic type B stretches the most and plastic type B stretches the most and plastic type A stretches the least. ^p B) The student could have stated what exactly he was looking for. He could have also added another trial to see a better average because some of them were close.
Based on the student's data, it's safe to say that plastic sample A was the strongest. You can see this because in the chart the plastic was the smallest. One thing the student could've improved was if all the plastic samples were the same size. This way all the pieces of plastic have the same starting point. Another thing the studend could change is taking two samples of each plastic so you weren't testing the same sample twice.
a) From the information in the data table, I can conclude that plastic Type B stretched the greatest, considering that 22 and23 mm is the highest number compared to the rest. ^p b) Two ways the students could have improved the design are measuring the length of plastic before the trials,and doing one more extra trial to check validity.
Out of both trials plastic type B got the longest after experiment. It streched out to 22mm in trial A and 23mm in trial B. Plastic type A stretched out the least. In trial A it reached 10mm and in trial B it reached to 12mm. ^p Two ways the students could have improved the validity of their results would be to add in the original lengths of the plastics in their data table. They could of also gave the names of the plastics instead of using letters.
Well in this data I can conclude that the amount stretched from trial one has increased when they did the second trial, but plastic D stood the same which was at 20. ^p The student could have made this experiment better by telling us what type of plastics they used. Also they could have said how much the weights, weighed.
a. Plastic type D stretched the most and A stretched the least. ^p b. They could have done a 3rd trial they could explain what brand of plastic each type was.
a.Based on the data from the experiment the plastics that bell's the most was plastic B in the first trial it expanded 22 min 23 min in the second trial.B. This experiment is belong a control and needs more trials to improve the validity.
Plastic type A had the most impact on stretching, type B and C only stretch out one mm longer & type a was the same.^p The student could have added more plastic types and let the weights clamps hang for a longer time.
We can conclude that plastic B is the plastic that can stretch the most we can also conclude that plastic A can stretch the least. The student should haw used the same length plastic for each. The student should have also made their data table it shows the plastic starting length and ending length.
Based on the students data, I can draw a conclusion that at the end of expirment, plastic type A stretched the longest with 2mm, and type D stretched the least by remaining the same at 20mm. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is first tell how much the weights weighed that he added to the clamp. Another way the experimental design could have been improved is by telling what kinds of plastic instead of using type A,B,C and D.
A It is concluded that plastic type A had the most streachability because it increased 2mm in length from being streched, and all the others either grew smaller or barely streched. ^p B Two ways this student could have improved the experimental design would be to have all the plastics begining length the same and also specify how much weight to add to the plastic samples.
A) Based on the students data I can conclude that plastic type B had the highest amount of plastic stretched compared to the other. ^p B) Two ways students could of  improved this experiment is by dding  materials to make results more reliable . Also, they should of had a control veriable of just the plastic so you can see the results on how far it has stretched.
Based on the data collected by the experiment, plastic type B has the greatest stretchability when attatched to weights. However, there are ways in which this experiment could be improved. The student did not specify how much weight or how many weights were added to the clamp. He/she should write how many weights they used or even add trials where they utilize different amounts. Also, a third trial should have been conducted to formulate an average stretchability length. Only 2 measurements is not clear, a third would allow the student to achieve an average length for each plastic, making the numbers more simple to process.
Plastic type B has more stretchability then plastics A,C or D. Plastic B stretched on average of 22.5mm whereas A averaged it, C averaged 13.5 and D averaged 20. The students should have specified the weight added and used that weight each time. The students should also have started with the same size plastic and specified that length.
A) A conclusion based on the student's data is that between each trail the number stayed the same or increased/ decreased by one.^p ^p B) Two ways the experiment could have improved is for the validity, is to write down the mm it started at and another way is to make sure when adding the weights they are the same found for each trail & plastic type.
According to the data plastic type B had the most Stretchability of all them and plastic type A stretched the least each trial. The students could've said what type of plastic it was and also stated the before and after numbers for the plastic just in case there were any errors in the experiment.
"Based on these results, I can conclude that plastic ""B"" has the most stretchability. These results are valid because of the two trials, so I can confidently conclude this. To improve the validity even more would be to use the same length plastic for each type because this may affect the results. Also, the should give a specific weight to add on the procedure instead of just saying ""add weights""."
The conclusion of this experiments that plastic B is the stretchiest with 22 and 23mm stretched in the two trials, an average of 22.5mm  plastic A was the least stretchy with 10 and 12 mm stretched in the two trials, an average of 11mm. The student could have improved the experiment by performong on trial 3 (T3) for the plastics to ensure validity. Another way could be to let the weights hang even longer or add more weights to each plastic to ensure validity.
A. Based on the data table the polymer plastic with the most stretchability is plastic type B because it was stretched out the  furthest, then the next most stretchy was D, then C, then the least was A. ^p B. Two ways to improve the experimental design or validity of the results are, be more specific; how much weight is being added to the plastics and for T2 I believe that a different amount of weight should be added to the plastic types.
In conclusion plastic A is the strongest and plastic D is the weakest. ^p The student could improve the validity of the results by 1) saying in T1+T2 they used 2 different sets of 4 kinds of plastics. And 2) you can also have at least one other person there to varify this.
A) From this data you can conclude that. There really wasnt much of a change and that T1 bag is stronger. ^p B) The student need an control and also need to be more spcific. when it comes to the weights.
Plastic sample B stretched the farthest.^p The experiment could have been improved by adding exact amount of what to be added on the plastics. Also to measure how much of the plastics edge to be taped to the table so they are standing at the same point.
Repeat the procedure, and use more examples.
To draw a conclusion I would figure out the patium to this data table. B Two way I think the students could of improved on this data table would be to take step eight & make sure they're right.
1) Based on the students data it is conclusive that plastic sample A is the strongest plastic because in trial one it's length was 10mm and in trial 2 it's length was 12mm. Plastic B is the weakest plastic because it's length after weights were added was 22mm, andon the second trial was 23mm. ^P B) The students could have improved the experiment by increasing the time from 5mins to 10mins, and increasing the number of trials with each samples.
The conclusion I drew from the data is that plastics B and D most likely have less rigid polymer structous than A and C. The students could have improved the experiment by doing more trials and including the exact weight of the weights to use. I think the experiment is pretty valid because there are no obvious errors, but the students could increase the validity by doing more trials.
Based on the students results the polymer plastic that was able to stretch the most was plastic B. This student could have improved the validity of the results by finding out the averages of how far each plastic was able to stretch. He could have also noted in his procedure that all the weights most weigh the same so it could be constant. These changes would have made the experiment better and make the results more valid.
Based on the data, plastic type B is the most stretchable polymer. ^p The student could have improved validity by reducing the time in each trial / using less weight.
Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic type B was the most strechable of the four plastics because in T1 it streched 22 mm and in T2 it streched 23 mm. One ways the student could have improved the validity of their results would be to do more trials. One way they could have improved the experimental design would be by specifying the amount of weights to place on the clamps in step 4.
a)The strechiest polymer plastic tested was type B, followed by type C then type A being the least stretchiest^p b)The student could have. Improved the experiment by compieting more trials to make conclusion more valid. Also the student could use a constant measurement of how far off the table the plastic should hang and where to tape it the student could also improve it by using a set amount of weights.
Based on the students data plastic type B was stretched the most plastic type A was stretched the last.I think two ways that could have made this lab better is that all the plastic types should all have to be the same length before you add the weights to them and second the procedure should tell you to record that data on a chat the the student did.
A) They should remain the same.^p B) They should take out the weights.^p C) They should work together on the project.
"Two ways the student could haved improved the experiment, one is todo more trials. Another is to let the clam hang for 10minutes. ^P The conclusion on for experiment is that plastic type ""B"" is the weakest because it streched the most and plastic A is the strongest."
a) Plastic type B has the most strechability because, it streched to 22 and 23mm for both trials. Plastics A, C,and D only reached maximum lengths of 12, 13 or 20mm for both trials. ^P b) The students could have improved their experimental design and/or validity by adding more trials or by ensuring that the same length of plastic hangs on the side of the table.
Plastic type A: stretched from 10to 12 increased 2. Plastic type B: stretched from 22 to 23 increased 1. Plastic C: stretched from 14 to 13 decreased 1. Plastic type D: stayed the same. ^P The student could have improved the experiemental design by performing diffrent trials.
It seems that plastic type B is the best. The reason why it was the best was becuse when it stretched it stretched for the longest. Two chuges I would mark would be more trials and more test plastics.
The conclusion is that the plastic B is the largest one in trial 1 & in trial 2. 30 plastic B is  the longest plastics out of all of the plastic style. the two ways to make experiment would be adding more trials and also having the plastic & weights hang for a longer time.
A) Plastic type B had the most amount of stretch compared to the others.^p B) The student should have specified the length because without a starting length, his data is inconclusive. The student also should have specified to hold up or attach the clamp to something so the ends would be equal. In his procedure, it seems like you put weights on it while it hangs loosely.
a.) The conclusion is that plastic type B had the most amount stretched in both trails and plastic type A had the least amount stretched in both trails. ^p b.) One way the students could have improved their experiment would have to be: Tell what type of plastic they use and another one would be to tell how long they stretched each plastic.
a) Plastic type A increased the more from the first trial to the second trial. It went from 10mm to 12mm. Type C was the only type of plastic that decreased the length. Type D stayed the same at 20mm of length. ^p b) The student could of had a control group which could of been a different type of plastic. Also the student could of had a third trial to see how it would change the amount the plastic was stretched from the first and second trials.
A)My conclusion is if you add more weight the length of the polymers would grow after 5 minutes.^p (B)They can improve by doing more trials, and by listing different polymers they were using. Also they can list wht type of weights they were using and how heavy those weights are.
"A) In conclusion plastic type ""B"" could stretch the most. ^p The students could improve their experiment by more trials and by stretching the plastic more ."
"Based on the student's data, I conclude that for the second trial, the plastic seem to have stretched slightly more than in the first trial. Also for plastic type ""D"" the plastic length stayed the same, meaning that it will not stretch any further. ^p b) Two different ways the students could have improved the experimental design is by adding more trials and more types of plastic to test."
My conclusion is that they did a pretty good job setting up the data table. They not only tried it once they tried it twice. One way they could of done a better job by instead of the data table they shouldn't did a bar graph.
A) I concluded that the stretchability of the plastics have no real difference because the stretchability of the plastics only very by 1 to 2 millimeters.^p B) Two ways the students could have improve the experiment is they could have added a specific amount of weight and they could have let the weights strecth the plastics for a longer period of time.
Extend the time of the weight longer, like about 10 minutes more. Use different materials.
The conclusion based on the student data is that plastic type D is the least stretchable and type A is the most stretchable. ^p To improve the experiment the students should have add more trials and also tested different amounts of weights so they could see how each plastic type reached when even more weight was put on.
It would appear from the data that plastic type B is the most stretch able of all the tested plastics. It stretched on average 2.5 more than the next stretches plastics. One way to improve is say what weight they will apply to each plastics for example 10g, 50g, 100g. Another way is to use the same mass for all of plastics.
A- A conclusion that can be made for this experiment is. In conclusion plastic D would be the strongest type of plastic because according to the data table in both trials plastic D did not stretch. ^p B- Two ways this student could have improved these experiment is by telling us the four different types of plastics used also by telling us how much weight it took to make the plastic stretch and what it is measured in.
Plastic A and D were able to withstand the most weights while B and C were the least. The students could have improved by using a control and doing more trials for more accurate test results.
a. The purpose of this lab is to test 4 different types of polymers to see which polymer is the stretchiest. Based on the results founded, it can be concluded that plastic type B was the stretchiest. In both trial one and trial 2, plastic B stretched the most with 22mm in Ti and 23mm in T2 plastic type A was the least stretchable with T1 and 12mm in T2.^p b. One way the lab could be improved would to have specified an exact width to use in the test. Another possible improvement would be to test for longer amount of time. This should show how the plastics stretch over a longer period of time.
Based on the student's data, I concluded that the amount each plastic stretch, had varied very little between trials. ^p Two ways the students could have improved their experiments would be, 1. They could have recorded the plastic samples lengths before they stretched them. 2. They could have and all the original samples to the same length, the started them.
I would say that plastic type B is the most  stretchable type of plastic because in test 1 and 2 it doubled plastic types A and C.
a) Plastic A stretched the least of all pour other plastics. Therefore it is one of the strongest because it stretched less. ^p b) One way the student could have improved their experiment is when repeating their experiment start with a new piece pf plastic. Other ways they can improve their experiment is by adding the same amount of weights at each type. Every weight they add should be the same.
My conclusion is that everytime you put weights on it it would stretch to a greater length. The ways I would improve it is to tell what kind of plastic is most recommended and what is the best length to use.
A conclusion would be plastic type A is the lested stretched with 10 T1mm and 12 T2mm. Also plastic type B had the most stretchability at 22 T1mm, 23m T2. And type C, D were C, 14 T1mm, 13 T2mm, D 20T1mm, 20 T2mm. Two ways the students could hae improvd was to hae a control with no weights on it. To improe and compare data. Also use the same amont of weights for each plastic. To keep data acorte.
The conclusion for this experiments is the plastic the trials the most stretchable: In trial 1 the amount stretched was 22mm. In trial 2 the amount stretched was 23mm.  ways the students could have improved the experiment design or validity of the results is to include the length before it was stretched and keep the amount of heights constants.
a. Based on the students data the conclusion I draw was that plastic B had the greatest stretchability. ^p b. One way that this student could have improved this experiment is to add more trials to have more data to trials conclusions with Another way the student could have improved the experiment was.
a) I conclude that plastic type B has the best stretchability and plastic type  A has the worst, type B had 23 and 22 while type D had 10 and 12 mm stretchest. ^p b) The students could improve their experiment if they recorded how many clamps they added before the plastic brake. The students also could have recorded the time the plastic brake at.
(a) Polymer plastic B s the stretchiest polymer plastic.^p (b) The student can verify that the lengths of all the plastics are the same at the begining of the experiment to keep samples constant, and he can verify the weights of the weights and clamps to keep variables constant as well.
A). The conclusion would be, that the procedure of this students data had went as planned. All of the results all were around the same number and some were the same. ^p B) Two ways the student could have improved on this experiment is to have a control group and also they could of had a third trial to make sure that the results were all correct.
The west flexible type of plastic was type B. On the first trial type B stretched 22 mm while type A hand the least flexibility by only streching 10mm. Also type D was the seacon strechiest plastic but it did not streck on trial 2. One way that yje students could've improved the expirement deating was by saying how much weight to put on the plastic. Their results codve be in been better by getting new plastic to stretch.
a- From looking at the student's data from their experiment, trial 2 had better results than trial 1. In trial 2, they could have done the producure more like the instructions tell them to instead of doing half. ^p b- I do not see anything that they couldhave done differently.
a) Plastic type A has the highest level of stretchability because from the 1st and the second trial it stretched 2 mm, while the other plastic types only stretched 1 mm or stayed the same. ^p b) Two ways the student could improved the experiment could have been to add more weights to the bags. Another way to improve the validity of the results is to specify how heavy the weights were and how many did he put.
Plastic type A stretched the least, only 10-12mm thus making it the strongest while plastic type B stretched the most, 22-23mm thus making it the weakest. Could have let the weights hang there for more than 5 minutes to increase validity and had more trials to increase validity.
a) According to the conclusion, plastic type A length stretch more than the rest of the plastics. Plastic A is the most stretchy. ^p b) The student could had added more trials and a can and groups.
From the student's experiment I can conclude that plastic type B was able to stretch the most while plastic type A stretched the least. However, these students need to improve their experimental design. Two ways that is possible would be to give definite and constant stretching results for each sample as well as defining how much weight should be used and where the clamp should be placed exactly. This would definitely improve the validity of their results.
Plastic type B is the strongest plastic to use. It was the strongest for both trial 1 and for trial 2. The student could have done one more trial to make the information a little more valid. Also the students could have let the weights hang longer than 5 minutes.
A) Plastic D stretched the same lenght in both that but plastic type A is the stretchrest. B) They could have done more thats and, the should have use different weights for more results.
Plastic type B streched the most, in T1 it strech 22mm and in T2 it streched 23mm. Plastic type B streched the same length in T1 and T2, 20mm. Type C streched 14mm in T1, but in T2 strech only 13mm. Type A stretched the lease, in T1 it streched 10mm and in T2 it streched in 12mm. The students can add more more time for the weights to hang. The students can also add a third trial to see witch if type C will remain to strengh and less.
A) Based on the data given, in the second trial, the plastics stretched more than the first. Also, plastic type B and D stretched the most in both trials. ^p B)Two ways the student could have improved their experimental design would be more specific with the procedure and try more trials to average out the results.
(a) In conclusion plastic type B was the strongest because it stretched the longest, Plastic A stretched 10 mm and 12 mm. Plastic B 22 mm and 23 mm and plastic C 14 mm and 15 mm and plastic D 20 mm and 20 mm. this data states that plastic B was the strongest. (B) One way he could have improved the experiment  is by having all the plastic equal in size and also he could have added the same amount of weight.
Trial D has better performed better.
(A) In contend the data recorded shows that plastic type D stretched the same amount in each trial. ^p (B) The students could have done a third trial they could have also had the weight and clamp hang for a longer time.
My conclasion is that T 2 had a better amount stretched than T 1 had. Also T2 had more plastic types than T1.
Plastic type B stretches the farthest. The students could have improved the experiment by doing a third trial and by specifying how much weight to add to the clamp.
A. Plastic type D is the p
My conclusion for this experiment is that if plastic B is used than it will be able to stretch the longest and hold the most amount of weights. The reason I know this is because in trial 1 and 2 it had the leading length. A way that this experiment could have been improved would be by not putting the weights on at the same time. This would allow for the bags to get use to each weight. Another thing could be to make sure all the plastics are equal in measurement because that can ruin the data.
a) Repeating the experiment T2's measurement increased successful than T1, by not changing the variable and repeating the experiment eight time. Shows how the wight of the weights affe3cted throughly. ^p b)The students could improve the experiment design by increasing the weight OR the weights, and using different types which usually be the dependent variable.
As a conclusion based on the data plastic type B was the more stretchable plastic. In trial 1 plastic type B stretched 22mm in trial 2 plastic type stretched 23 mm. Therefore plastic type B has a high stretchability level. B) Two different ways the student could have improved.^p 1) The student could have stated how much the weights weighed and how many to make the experiment more vigor.^p 2) The student could have indicate the trial high because some bags take longer to stretch or/and break.
a) My conclusion is that polymer plastic B had the most stretchability.^p b) Two ways the experiment could have been improved would be.^p 1) Allow the bags to stretch until they break, and record the maximum length each stretched to.^p 2) The students could have specified the weights used.
According to the students data I would conclude that plastic B was the most stretchy compared to the other 3 plastics. The students could of added the weights in the same exact order and made sure she measured in the same measurements.
a)I conclude that plastic type B stretched the most because in the trial it stretched 22mm and in the second 23mm. Plastic type A stretched the least because it only stretched 10mm in the first and 12mm in the second trial.^p b)The students could have improved their experiment in several ways. First off that could have identified a specific amount of weight to add on to the clamp.They could have also included a control.
a) One conclusion I observed based on the student's data is that plastic type B is the most stretchable of the 4.^p b) Two ways the experimental design could have been improved are if 1) the student described the amount of weight putting the bags and 2) the student could have done the trials again using more time.
a) In conclusion, the plastic type that stretched the most was plastic B. ^p b) Two ways that the student could of improved his or her investigation is by saying how many weights will they student put and how much does it weigh . Also, describe how long the plastic  types were before she started her experiment.
A) My conclusion is that the second trial went better than the first because the numbers are much larger than the first. ^P B) The first way is the students could have been more specific on what they did. And the seeena way is they should have said what types of plastics and tapes they was using.
(A) Trial 2 was the one with the most stretchability. Trial 1 was around the trial 2's numbers but trial 2 was a ting but tiger or stayed the same. Plastic C actilly decreased one. ^p (B) They should have tryedengce plastic more trials to see it most would increase or decrease.
a. In conclusion, some of the plastics stretched more than others, however all of them did stretch. Polymer A stretched the least and polymer B stretched the most. From the results it can be assumed that all polymers stretch. ^p The student needs to specify how much weight is added and what the starting and ending measurement of each plastic were.
The conclusion of this lab shows that in the first trial the plastic was stretched 2mm. Trial two it was stretched 1mm. Supprisingly in the third trial it actually got smaller by 1mm. Also the last trial it stayed the same length. Two improvements could have been how the students should have made the weights heavier and should have made a clearer data table.
The students can conclude plastic type A is least stretchable, and plastic type B is the most stretchable and will be less likely to break. The students could have improved the experimental design by telling us what they originially measured the plastic in (ft,cm,in. e.t.c) Told us how many weights and how much they weighed and the type of tape that tapped the plastic in the table.
The conclusion based on the student's data is that with trial1 and with trial 2 there were some changes happen the amount of plastic stretched more the second trial than the first. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design is in what minute did the stretch begin and what plastic was the strongest.
Based on the data, it can be concluded that plastic A is the least stretchable, and plastic B is the most. Plastic A stretched 10mm and 12mm in both trials, which was the smallest length. Plastic B stretched 22mm and 23mm, which was the largest length after five minutes. The students could have improved their experiment, and their results by using plastic samples of the same length, and by allowing the plastic to stretch for a longer period of time.
plastic A was obviously the most susceptials to stretching because it stretche 2 inches, while plastic B only stretched 1, plastic D did not stretch at all, and plastic C lost an inch. This experiment would be more valid if the procedure said how much weight to add to the plastic (so that it was known what it takes to stretch it) and how the plastic was being measured . Although the data table says that the procedure does not.
The conclusion i have drawn is that plastic type D both trials stretched the same amount also that T2 was better. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and /or validity of the results is by compairing their trials to different plastics and collecting that data.
a. Based on the students data, plastic type B had more stretchability than the others. ^p b. The student could have done more trials or added on more time, for the plastics to stretch longer.
A) Plastic type B was the most stretchy and stretched the longest during the given time. ^p B) The way the students could of improved was they could of conducted more trials to improve the validity of the results also in their procedure they could of said to make sure each polymer plastic was measured out before the experiment so they all start at the same length.
Plastic B, proven by the results is the most stretchable of the four plastics. Due to it stretching 22mm on the first trial, and 23 mm on the second trial, its average amount stretched to 22.5 mm making it 25mm stretchier the the runner up plastic. ^p One way they could have improved the design of the experiment is by making sure all the plastics used had the same initial length. Also to tell how much the weights of the clamp weighed to be able to reconduct the experiment to do more trials.
(A) The plastic that stretched was B T2 and the least was A T1. ^p (B) The way the student could of improved this expiremen is by when they put tape on top of the edge of the plastic sample to a table well they should of left putting weight on th plastic to see how much it holds.
A) Based on the students data I can draw the conclusion that plastic type B had the most stretchability. If you you reter back to the graph in trial 1, plastic B was 22 and in trial 2 it was 23 which was more than any of the other plastics. B) One way in which the students could have improved the experimental design is by adding another trial. They could also have told you how long the type of plastic was to regin with in the first place therefore increasing the validity and accuracey of the experment.
Student will wrap up an conclusion after plastic type & the amount it strech is done. The whole experiment was based on how far each plastic streched and which one streched the first and also the one whiched streched the least. ^p They could have improved it by streching  each plastic three seperate trial and the answer would have been more clear.
Two ways that the students could have improved the expirement design or validity of the results is by increasing the amount of times they stretched the plastic and the plastic type could get changed.
A) Plastic B seemed to be the most durable because in it stretched 22mm in t2 it stretched 23mm and the least durable seemed to be plastic A because in T1 only stretched 10mm and in T2 it stretched 12mm B) They could have specified the type of plastic and long in seconds was the plastic being stretched.
A)From the data ,I am able to conclude that plastic type B is the most durable. Its length stretched to be 22 and 23.This show that it was able to hold the heaviest amount of weights (B) one way the student could improve the experimental design is by using same weights for each plastic .Also the student  should use the same measuring just so they can be reassured that the length of the plastic is accurate for each of the 4 plastics.
The conclusion is that the plastic did stretched out but some stayed the same length and other decreased. ^p The student would have improved is by having a control group by doing it by a certain weight and other put more weight see if there any difference in ti stretchability.
Of the four types of plastic A and C stretched about the same amount of weight and D stretched about the same amount. The first way, they could improve the experiment would be to test different amounts of weight. They should also only measure what hangs over the table both times for a more precise result.
a) To conclude, plastic type B is the most stretchable out of all four types of plastics. Type B stretched 22 mm on T1, and 23 mm on T2 (average of 22.5 mm) while type A and C ranged between 10 mm and 11 mm, and type D 20 mm. Type A was the most stretch resistant, so this type of plastic would be the best for grocery bags so that food doesn't fall out. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is by including how much the weights attached to the clamp on the plastic weighed, and how long the plastic should be for each type. Should it be the same or different.
"Based upon the given data, I can conclude that plastic B had the most stretchability. The first thing the student needs to fix is in his experimental design, In step 4, (s)he says to ""add weight ..."" but they don't specify how much  weight to add. The next thing that needs to be fixed deals with validity. The student needs to record, the starting length of each plastic, as well as keep their length constant. ^p Say exat amount of weights to add record starting legnth of plastics."
a.Based on the students data plastic B was able to be stretched the most, it was stretched 22 mm the first time and 23 the second.^p (b)First, the student should have stated how much weight to add to the clamp and measured how much the clamp weighed. To get the total weight added would've improved validity. Also the student should have made the plastic sample all the same length so that they started from the same point.
I predict according to this experiment that the student could improved their experiment by try one more time, find out the contro, find out the variables, find out the independent variable & dependent variable. Do a hypothesis & conclusion, that's what I think the student have to do to validify the results of the experiment.
a) Based on the students data one can conclude that plastic type B had the most stretchability. For both trials preformed, type B stretched the furthest at 22 mm + 23mm. Therefore, this type of plastic is probably the most durable of the  4 because it was able to withstand such stretching. ^p b) The students could have improved by specifying what types of plastics to use instead of just A, B, C or D. Also by specifying how far from the edge of the table each piece of plastic needs to be taped as this can effect results if they are not all the same lengths.
3. A) Base on the data given plastic B stickched for nest. ^p B) The student could have written the starting length of the plastic. He also cook have put his reasoning for doing the experiment.
My conclusion is that plastic type A can stretch the least, because not only did it not stretch anymore in T2 it actually got 1mm shorter. Plastic type A is the best because it can stretch the most. it stretched 2mm more in T2. ^p (b) One way the student could have improved his/her experimental design and/or validity of the results is to include the data on what the plastics measured before he added weights. He could have also included the weights of the weights he added.
a)The amount stretched by T2 showed more improvement by having it stretched because the different material. Both were investigated at the same time. One place was more affected.^p (b)One way is is by maybe leaving it a little longer. Or use different types of weight.
Based on the students data we can conclude that plastic B has the most stretchability compared to plastics AC, or D. In trial 1 plastic type B stretched 22mm and 23mm in trial 2. All of the other plastics stretched less than this amount. For example, plastic A only stretched 10 & 12mm for trials 1& 2. Ways this experiment can be improved can be do to even more trials inorder to varify results even greator. They also can specify the size of the plastic and keep it constant. The length of each plastic shows the same. If the plastics are of different sizes then the results could be affected. Also, the students could have also specified how much like weight is and used the same amount of weights for each one. If one plastic had 21 kg on it and another 31kg, then the one with 31kg may stretch farther not because it has more stretchability but because it was held by more weight. This is how they could improve.
A) In conclusion the amount strech T2 streched a little bit more than T1 by 2 mm. I shows that T2 can strech more than T1. ^P B). One way they can improve by waiting a little longer the five minutes and second way is that they should of used three kinds of different plastics.
a. From the results of the experiment you can see that plastic type B has the highest amount of stretchability while plastic type A has the lowest amount of stretchability.^p b. The students should use the same amount of weights for each plastic. And add a control to the experiment to improve the experiment.
Based on the students data plastic A and B both stretched 1mm more on the second trial but the plastic type that had stretched the most in trial 1 and 2 is plastic B. ^p The student could of improved this experiment by adding the weights but with a certain amount of weight that was used the same on each plastic and trial. Also the student should have stretched each sample as far as it would go.
A) The data shows that trial two was more efficient than trial one because they all increase other than one (plastic type). I can also conclude that the plastic type that stretched the most was plastic B. ^p B) Two ways the students could have improved there experiments are, 1. let it hang for longer than five minutes, and 2. perform more trials.
(A) My conclusion on the expirement is that, plastic type D has the longest mm stretched out. (B) (1) The student have put the plastic on a hanging string was a steamy, boiling pot of water. (2) Then, the student could have recorded more valid, and improved data on a chart.
By the out come of this experiment, you can tell that plastic B is the stretchiest. Two things that could have been done to improve the experiment are making sure how long the plastics should be in the beginning and if all the plastic types should be the same length before you tape them.
Based on the student's data, I can conclude that plastic types A and B stretched more in the second trial than in the first trial. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and the validity of the results are that he should have written the beginning measurements of each piece of plastic, and he should have tested each piece three times not just two.
The two ways that the students could have improved on this experimental design is one what kind of plastic where they using and name each one. The second would be what would you measure the plastic. What type of measuring stick you would use or a triple beem balance. Also they could have dawn three trials to make there experiment valid.
a) Based on the results I can conclude that plastic types B and R had a similar stretchability because they increased by 1mm. Type C and D are not as stretchable because type actually decreased by 1mm after trial 2 and type D stayed the same. ^P b) The student should have told us much each weight and how many will go on the plastic types.
a) Plastic type B can stretch the most, while A has the most tensile strength because it streched the least. ^p b) The student could have improved their design by having the plastic be the same lenghth for each plastic. For example each could be a foot long. A second change would be to put the same amount on each plastic, for example each could have a lag weight.
In conclusion after doing this experiment I came to the conclusion that the plastic type by was the one with the longest length of the plastic types. It had 22mm in the first trial and it had 23mm in the second trial. ^p The student could've waited more than 5mins to measure the length.
My conclusion would be that plastic type (D) would be the most strechy because it went up to 20mm with out tearing. Two ways students could have make the experiment by one cutting a determined length for all four plastics and recording the time it took  to stretch .
A. A conclusion I can draw from this is that plastic type A had stretched 22mm the first trial, and 25mm in the second trial making it the most stretchable plastic type. ^p B. I think that this student should have done at least 3 trials. I think this student should have not taped the plastic at the top of the table he should have done it over a bar so both sides could be tested.
a) The plastic thas has the most stretchability is plastic type B a stretch of 22mm in the first trial and in the 23mm in the second trial. Plastic type A has the worst stretchability. Stretching 10mm in the first trial and 12mm in the second trial. ^p b) They should have stated and used the same amount of weights for each trial. They also should have used the same amount of each plastic.
a. Based on the student's data, the amount of stretchability in each opastic type was different for trial 1 and 2. (with an exception of type D that remained the same). ^p b. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design are to clarify the weight of the weight they added on step 4, then for step 6 they should have had clarified the procedure that had to be repeated (ex repeat steps 1-5 exactly for other three plastic plastic samples).
a)I see that the amount stretched of plastic A & B increased on the second trial, but the amount stretched of plastic A decreased and the amount stretched for plastic D remained the same. ^p b) The student could have make a third trial to see what the outcome would be. The student could have made the trials for another period of time so instead of five mns and he does ten minutes for each of them.
(a) Based on the students trials I have come to conclusion that plastic B was able to stretch more than A, C, D witch make it more resistant then the rest.^p (B)The students could of group this experiment on each experiment to see how much it could change, and they could of also made a graph to show the results.
A. To conclude, the polymer plastics went through four trials. The data shows that A was averaged to 11, B was averaged to 22.5, C was averaged to 13.5, and D stayed at 20. The plastic type B stretched to most. I predict that if they did a 3-rd trial the numbers would be close. ^p B. The students could of improved if they let the plastic hang for 10 minutes and maybe the results wouldn't be so close. Also, add more details to the procedure.
A) In conclusion, plastic type A stretched 2mm more in the second than in the first trial. Plastic type B stretched 1mm more in the second trial than in the first. Plastic type C stretched 1mm more in the second trial than in the first trial. Plastic type D stretched the same amount in both trials.^p B) To improve the validity the group could have stated how much weight to use and had more tests and trials.
Students could have made his or her own hypothisis to test. Also should have the procedure more than 2 times.
Based on the data, B was the most stretchable polymer, followed by D,C and lastly A. Serious sources of error need fixing. For one, the initial length of plastic was not held constant making all data most. Also, allowing the plastics to stretch until breaking. Would truly test this property. However, as the results are consistent between trials, the results seem valid.
(a) Based on the students data plastic type B stretched the most. All of the bags stretched only around 1 to 2mm difference in both trials compared to their first. ^p (b) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results was to show the length before they were stretched and show the amount of weight added onto the clamps.
The plastic that stretched the most in both trials was plastic type B. It stretched-22mm and the second trial it stretched 23 mm. That shows it has the most durability for stretching. ^p The students should have put down the measurement they chose to start the plastic at. They should have also included the time on the data table. They should have done various trilas to the e3xperiment.
They could take notes and make a bar graph and put all of it together and come out with the answer. ^p They could use a weight and find out how much the weight by its self.
By the process or doing it, the graph showed me that the amount of stretched of T1 and T2 didn't change, both plastic had the same stretched. And it would change by adding more weights because the plastic wouldn't be resible as the other one.
a) According to my conclusion B was the one who got stretch the longest and A was the shorter one. b) One way they could do this to make it better is by using different plastics type or by duck taping the plastic to a cup and start putting weighs until it breaks.
For plastic type A, the amount stretched increased by one mm. For plastic type D, the amount stretched for trial one and two were the same. With plastic C, the results decreased by one mm. The students could improve their results by repeating more trials. They also didn't mention the measure the plastic be originally.
The conclusion is most student plastic stretched more then others. They could improved the experiment by leaven the clips 30 mins.
a) plastic type B stretch the most than D then C then A. The second trial all of the plastic began to stretch even more beside plastic C, plastic C didn't increase it's stretching in trial to, actually in trial 1 it stretched more than in trial 2.
a) Plastic type B is the the most elastic plastic and type A is the least elastic plastic, however, all plastic types are elastic. ^p b) The student could have included a specific weight to use and they could have provided elastic types.
A) I would conclude that plastic A is the strangest because it didn't stretch as much as plastics B, C or D. ^p B) One thing the student's could have done to improve their experiment is include exactly how much weight they put on each clamp so it could eaisy repeated and eaiser to understand. Another thing they can do is do a third trial for more accurate results.
a) Plastic B is the most flexible of the 4 plastic types. ^p b) The validity should be improved if the students: -specified how much weight was added to the clamp. -Also specified how high up the table was.
Plastic B happens to stretch the furthis in trial 1 & 2. The student could have used more plastic. Also the students could have used more trials that would have shown the accuracy.
A) In conclusion, the student's data that was recorded showed plastic type B capable of stretching the most, than D, than C, & plastic type A stretched the least. ^p B) One way the students could have improved the experiment design/validity of the results would be by learning a hypothesis. Another thing that could be an improvement is if they varied the times the plastic hanged for up the amount of weight for each type.
a) Based on the student data, plastic B is the most stretchable. Plastic B stretched an average of 22.5mm, while the next most stretched plastic was D, with an average of 20mm. ^p b) To improve validity/design, the student could have conducted more trials. The students also should have specified exactly how heavy the weights used are, so that the experiment is recreatable.
(A) The more weight used the more the plastic stretched. ^p (B) They should've used something more strong than tape to hang the plastic from the table and specify  if all the plastic pieces are the same length and wid therefore they start experimenting on them. They should also say how much weight they are adding on at a time and how log you wait before adding on more weights.
By the result of the student's investigation they have concluded that plastic type B is the stretchiest polymer of all four and plastic type A is the least stretchiest polymer. ^p Three ways the student could have improved the experimental design is by starting off with each polymer with the same length. The same amount of weights for each polymer and repeating the experiment 3 times instead of 2.
A) We can conclude that plastic type B is stronger because on the best trial I only stretched by mm. Then on the second trial it decreased to stretch by 1 more. Picture type A is strong but on the first trial it stretches 10mm, while on the second trial it stretched & mm more. We would rather have the stretch decrease than increase. B) The students could have added more time to the bags being stretched and they could have done more trials.
3.a) In conclusion, plastic  sample B stretched the most when testted for strechability. It stretched nearly twice as much as samples A-C but sample D was close in amount. ^p b) The first way the students could improve their experiment is to specify in how many weights they attached and make sure all the weights weighed the same. they also could have been more specific about the clamp so they can have a control and nothing could effect the validity of the results.
There is not enough data to draw a conclusion from the students data, the students never told us what the starting length of the polymer plastic where and they never told us how much the weight weighed.
For the name of color the plastic.
To conclude the polymer investigation, according to data, plastic A is the Stretchiest. Plastic D is the least stretchy. ^p Two ways the student could have improved this experiment is by 1. telling us how long the plastic measured before it was stretched, another way is by 2. how much did the weights weigh?
Based on the students data it shows that plastic type A had the highest stretch constance to the weights pulling on it. In the two trials it only stretched 10 and 12mm while the next best stretched 13 and 14. One way to improve their experiment is to have performed a third trial. Although their test two were similar to end results the third trial would only have made it more valid definitely proving their results are correct. Another way is to specify how heavy the weights are and what type of plastic is being used. Then the reader would know exactly what you're doing in the experiment, and it'd give a better understanding.
A) A conclusion drawn from this experiment would be that plastic type B has the most flexibility. B) One way to improve the experiment would be to make sure each plastic gets weights in the same places. Another step would be to make sure the clamp was on the same place on each plastic so the experiment is more valid.
Based on the students data plastic type B in trials 1 and 2 stretched the most and have the most stretchability. ^P One way the student could improve this is by using the same weight for each bag and trial. Another way is by using the same clamp type so it's the same weight added from it each time.
A conclusion that can be reached based on the student's data would be that the best plastic type to use to prevent breakage of a bag would be type D. It was not stretched at all when the weights were added. One way to improve the validity of this experiment would be to conduct more trials, and the average not the results. This would ensure which plastic is the strongest. Another way to improve validity would be to specify the weight used and know it as a control for each plastic type. These two things must be done to ensure validity.
Based on the data I can conclude that the plastics stretched more in the second trial compared to the first trial. Also I can conclude that plastic B stretched the most because it held the most weight. One way the students can improve the experimental design is to include exactly what plastic they are using. Another way the could improve their experimental design is to include what they are using as weights foreach plastic.
"a. The plastic type ""B"" has the most stretchabilty because in both trials it had a large lengths. ^p b) The student could improve the validity of the results by making sure he kept the same time limit. Also he could made none he did not stretch the plastic by hand when releasing the weights."
The students could of lable the chart better than the did. The could have one add more info to the procedure and state why they are doing this experiment for.
A) That depending on the plastic type depends weather the plastic stretch or not and how much. ^p B) One way put the first length then the second on the chart another way titled the plastic types.
Plastic type A stretches longer than the other plastic types. The student could improve the experiment by putting the name of plastics. And add another trial. 3 trials are always best.
A) I conclude that trial one and two have similar numbers so plastic B and D are the strechiest. ^P B) One way the students could have improved on the validity of the experiment is by using something better than tape to hold the plastic clamp at least tell us the kind and trand of tape. Another way this experiment would be better is if I leneth the weight that tore the plastic.
Plastic type B has the greatest elasticity while plastic type A has lowest. The student could improve validity by having more trials and recording starting (mm).
Conclusion: The students got their information based on the test results, which seem pretty reasonable. ^p B) Two ways the student could have improved their experiment was have a control and have more trials.
a. Plastics A and B and C are more stretch resistant than plastic B and D. Also plastic B stretched the most with 22mm the first trial and 23mm the second trial. ^p b. One ways they could of told us the IV, OV and the constants of the lab like why they are doing it.
In the end, trial 2 of the experiment had stretched a couple mm longer, a part from plastic D, than trial 1. This experiment can be improved by keeping the weight on for 5 minutes longer to give a better result. Another way it can be improved is doing one more trial to get more results to compare for the lost mass to improve it is adding another plastic type to provide a variety of plastics.
Based on the data we can conclude that plastic type B is the stretchiest since it stretches the most in both trials. ^p Keep the same length of the plastics of a constant and specified length. Repeat trials again (3rd time).
(A) The strongest plastic was C. ^p (B) They should have recorded the length of the plastic pieces and added it to the data table before testing, and they could have added another test and used more weights.
Plastic type D was the most stretched out of all of the other plastics. The student needed to repeat the steps for a 3rd time also. The student should not have used the same plastic over they should have gotten a new place do the results would show validity to results.
Based on the student's results, the plastic with the most stretchability is plastic B. Both trials it had the highest length. It beat plastic D by 2 and 3mm. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experiment is by repeating the experiment at least one more time. It helps the validity of the experiment. Another way he/she could have improved is by having a certain length and shape for the various plastics.
Plastic type B is the stretchiest type of the 4 plastic types this student tested.^p (b)The student could've specified how many weights to add and how much each weight weighed.
Plastic type B is the most stretchable plastic out of the other four. The students could have ensured that all the plastics are the same length before they begin the experiment. They could have also added specific amounts of weight rather than simply adding a random amount. This would have made the experiment more conclusive.
A) The plastic was stretched, but not a lot, at the most it was stretched two inches. ^p B) They could have said how heavy the weights were, also state what type or brand of plastic is being used.
In conclusion the experiment has even led that the four different polymer plastics neither stretch very  far each trial or didn't stretch very far at all. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experiment design and/or validity of the results are: Giving us the starting measurements and doing the trial a third time to see   if the results change or show the same.
-The validity of the data is questionable, but one conclusion is that plastic A was the strongest because it stretched the least. ^p -Two things the students could have done to improve his experimental design/validity of his results are (1) Data certain leng
"a) Out of all 4 plastics type B was the most stretchable for both trials, D was the second most stretchable, C the third, and A was the least"", To improve the experimental design, the student should have specified the length of the plastics and made sure they were all the same continuity and accuracy of the results. Another thing that should have been done is the mass of the weights should have been included and it should have been specified that they were all the same to again ensure accurate results."
3. For the conclusion the students could of put what kind of plastic they used. Also they could made the data table a little more details. ^p The students could have improved their experiment by baming some of the plastics,also they could of put the size of the weights.
Plastic type D stay the same . They should had left more minutes to hang.
A) From the students data table I came to a conclusion that plastic B is more stretchable. ^p B) They could have done more trial and try other plastics.
A) Plastic type B has the most stretchability and plastic type A has the least stretchability. ^p B) The student could have told how much weight they put on the plastic. They could of also explained how plastic types become smaller.
Based on the students data, Plastic type D had the most stretchability it stretched 20mm 0n T1 and stretched the same in T2. While A stretched 2mm and B stretched 1mm and C went from 14mm on T1 and dropped to13mm on T2. ^p The ways the students could've improved the experimental design is by telling us how much weight they used and add more weight.
"a) Plastic ""D"" length did not increase or decrease in both trials. ^P b) One way student ^p could have improved the experimental design by letting it hang for more time to see how it was affected when it stretched. Since their results in both trials were close, they shouldve tested it rersus another."
a) In conclusion (T2) stretched alot more than (T1). They were trying to investigate witch kind of plastic stretched more. ^p b) Two ways the student could of improved their design, was explain clearly what they were doing, and why in their procedure. Also maybe they should of did a (T3) to realy test it because if it was different in (T1), and (T2) then they definitaly dont have a final answer.
In conclusion the type of polymer does affect its ability to stretch because plastic types: A & b, indeed did stretch by at least 1-2 (mm). However plastic types: C & D either got smaller (shrinked) or did neither stretch nor decrease but remained the same. ^p Two ways this design could have been improved would be to: have an equal amount of weights placed on all clamps and do more than 2 trials.
a) Based on the student's data, polymer plastic type B was the most stretchable and polymer plastic type A was the most resistance to stretching, or the strongest. Type B stretched an average of 22.5mm, while type A stretched only an average of 11mm, and types C and D came in the middle, stretching averages of 13.5mm, and 20mm. Type A had the strongest polymer in the plastic and type B had the weakest. ^P b.) The first improvement could have been to include control, by testing the stretchability of the materials or plastics without polymers, or running trials on the same plastics without adding weights, to have a valid comparison to see if the polymers are actually what are affecting their stretchability. The second improvement could be to make sure each plastic is of the same thickness, as that can affect stretchability. They could also use more precise instrument or run more trials.
a.) Plastic type A is stronger and stretches less/ slowest then C,D, and B. ^p b.) Make each plastic the same starting lenth, and the weights are the same weight.
As a conclusion to the data shown on the table, plastic B had the most stretchability. According to the data collected, the information is reliable because, the amount stretched in T!wasn't too different than T2. -The student could've made the experiment more reliable by specifying the exact length of each plastic to start with, and made them all the same. Also the student should've been exact about the weights and made sure it was the same for all of them.
Plastic type A stretched the least, followed by types C and D leaving B to be the stretchiest plastic type. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment would be to test at different time periods, and to specify the amount of weight is being added to the clamp.
a) Plastic B is the most elastic because it had the highest average amount stretched at 22.5mm. Type A was the least stretchable at an average of 11mm. ^p b) The student have given a specific amount for the weight to be used. In addition the amount to be off the table should be given because the amount hanging off affects how far it will stretch ^p and controlled for each trial.
Plastic type B is the stretchiest plastic and plastic type A is the least stretchiest plastic. The students could have improved there design by naming the type of brand of type they used and the amount of it to hold the plastic wrap. Another improvement would be measuring the amount of plastic so that it would be the same amount for each plastic type and using the same weights for each trial so that the results would be correct.
Based
A. Based on the data present in conclusion we can say that plastic type D was the most stretchable plastic type. We can make this conclusion because plastic type D stretched 20mm, the longest:farther than A (12,10mm) ,B(23,22mm) + C(14,13mm).^p B. The students could have used a more study material than tape to tyld up the plastic sample, so it would not affect the stretching of the material. The students also could have specified a specific weight to use for each plastic type, so that they were being pulled the same amount.
According to the students data, plastic type B seemed to stretch the most among the other plastic types, as it stretched 23 mm after that 2. Plastic type A stretched only 12mm, therefore it stretched the least. Plastic types C reached 13mm and plastic type D reached 20mm. B) Two ways in which students could have improved their experiment is by stating exactly how many weights one should add to the clamp, and use a control to improve the valiaty of the results.
Conclusion: In conclusion, polymer plastic B had the most stretchability with 25mm, and polmer plastic A had the least almost of stretchability with 12mm validity. He could of bad more trials, and include plastic types in his procedure.
A) Based on the information it have plastic type B has a high stretchability compared to plastic type A whas stretchability is very low. ^p B) They should've added a materials so we know what they used to do their experiment. Also they should've wrote conclusion so we knew how their experiment turned out.
T1 and T2 are very close with their data. They could've increased the time to hang the plastics to ten minutes instead of five. They could have named the plastics.
Due to the data each time the student adds weight the plastic length seem to increase after the amount of time. For example I the type A plastic the first experiment is different their the seemed on because the doings strecht the plastic more after the first trial. The two ways I believe the student should have improved the experiment is by using different kind of plastic and weights.
Based on the student's data plastic type B stretched the most and the 2nd trial (T2) proved that. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design are doing a third trial to more fully ensure accuracy and doing something different in the 2nd trial like waiting 10 minutes instead of just 5.
A) Plastic type B is easily the most sufficient plastic because it had the highest measurements for both trials. ^p B) 1.They could of easily measured for more time. This way they could see how much more it could stretch. 2. They could of had one more trial usually an experiment has 3 trials. This way average will be more precise.
Based on the student's data, we can conclude that plastic type D had the most stretchability. The student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results by doing more trials so there can be an average of the amount stretched instead of having 2 measurements that are both different and by stating how much the weight should weigh because different weight size could cause the plastic to stretch more or less.
A) The students plastic seemed to get longer with each trial, except for plastic type C and D which decreased and stayed the same. ^p B) The student could have performed another trial. They also can use different kinds of plastic for the next experiment to improve it. And show us the begging length for trial 1 to see how much it stretched.
A)My conclusion is that plastic B stretched more than the other types of plastic, because plastic A stretched up to the average 11 and plastic B had an average of 22.5.^p (B)Two ways the student could have improved the experimental are (1)The student could do more trials, and (2)the student could gave the information about the measure of each sample of plastic.
a) Based on the data shown, the polymer plastics will streach but not much. Plastic type A streached out the most out of the four.^p b) One way the students could have improve is by doing more trials. Another way it could be improved is by stating how much the weights weigh & how many are being put onto the plastic.
(A) The conclusion could be that plastic D was the strongest of the plastics because it did not stretch at all. ^p (B) Two ways this exparement could have been improved is by telling how much waright to add to the clamp and the dementions of plastic.
a) Plastic type B had the most stretchability while plastic type A had the least.^p b) All the plastics should be the same length. Make a machine add the weights and remove them and the clamp b/c a human may place the weight w/a different amount of force for every plastic.  Put two clamps instead of tape b/c the tape may evert it's own force while the clamps wont.
A) In conclusion plastic type B was the most stretchable plolymer plastic.^p B) The student could tell you the size of the polymer plastic and make sure all of them are the same size. Also the student can tell you how much weight is being clamped on to the plastic.
a) Since there were four different types of plastics, type B seemed to stretch the longest both trails because it is most likely the strongest.^p b) Perform even more trials for validity and be are to keep the clamp, the weights, and wherever you hang the plastic constant for each trial you could also perform a control experiment with no weights.
A) In trial two the plastics stretched more expect for plastic C. ^P B) The students could have done another trial. They could be specific with how much the weights weigh. The students could have named the typed of plastic they used instead of using A,B,C and D.
I could concluded that plastic type B was stretched the most after the experiment which would instate that it is the most flexible. On the other hand plastic type A streched the least meaning it is the least flexible cut of the 4 plastic types. To improve this exerinent the experiment could have had more trials acurate data. The weight could have been increase and or the trials for better results.
A) In conclusion polymer B, is the one that could stretch the most, and polymer A is the one who can't stretch as wide. ^P B) To make the validity of the experiment more accurate than they should of had exact measurment, for example in step 2, the could of said how much it should be hanging by. Also, the could of added another trial, it is always good to have 3 trials just in case of any mistakes.
a) A conclusion based on the students data would be that plastic B is the strongest. Out of all the plastic at 22mm. In the first trial had 23mm in the second trial, because it stretch more than all the other. ^p B) Two the student could have improved the experimenting and / or validity of the result are to add new types of plastics and add more trials to the containers.
Out of the four different polymer plastics for stretchability the most stretched was plastic type b. The least amount stretched was plastic a. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and/ or validity of the results would have tried different time lengths. maybe like 10 minutes after 5 minutes. Repeat the experiment all together with all types of plastics.
A. According to the students data 2/4 of the plastics stretched more in the second trial than in the first trial by the minimum of 1mm.^p B. Two ways the student could have improved their experimental design is 1. They should have taken more trials, at least two more, and 2. They should used more types of plastics.
Based on the data, a conclusion would be that the plastic types pretty much were the same as each trial give or data a mm each trial. ^p This ways the students could have improved the experiment is explain how much the weight weighed and did that weight stay the same for every types of plastic.
In conclusion, based on the data from the chart, each trial for plastics A, B, C, and D were increasing, decreasing or staying the same. The most stretchable would be plastic B . It started off as the stretchiest, before it was pulled and remained that way afterwords. ^p b. The student could have said what types of plastic was used and not just A, B, C or D. He also could have done more than 2 trials, 3 would have been better.
In conclusion, plastic type B was the strongest plastic. In trial 1 it stretched to 22 mm while plastic D only stretched to 20mm and C to 14mm. In trial 2 plastic B stretched to 23mm while D only stretched to 20mm and c to 13mm. One way the student could have improved their experimental design was to stretch the plastic until it was about to brake to get the full stretchability. The student could have also done more trials to get more valid results.
1)My conclusion would be that plastic type D stretched the most but not the same amount, the 2nd trial it stretched 1 mm more than the 1st trial. And plastic type A stretched the least, T1: 10 mm and T2:12mm but it stretched 2 mm more in the 2nd trial than the first. ^p Two ways they could have improved the experimental design and for identify of results is they could have made another trial (T3) at least and could have let the weight hang longer than 3 minutes.
A and C did not stretch too far, but B and D stretched much more. The student could have given the beginning lengths in his data, or he could have added more and more weights and seen how far the plastics would stretch.
a) The most plastic type B had the most stretchability in the trial , it stretched 22mm visible plastic type A stretched 10mm and in trial 2 it stretched 23mm while type A stretched 12mm. ^p b) The students should had the lengths of the plastics start out he same that way no plastic could be able to hold more weights since it was longer. Students should also specify how many weights are added for five minutes so that way a plastic doesn't stretch more just because it had more weights.
According to the data table plastic type A was the most strechable. Type B and C decreased when measured again after having placed weights and type D stayed the same. Therefore, type A was the most strechable considering the longitude it made by 2mm.
Based on our results of the polymer investigation we found out that plastic type A stretched the most of two mm. Type B stretched the second furthest at 1mm, and type C lost 1 mm and finally type D didn't lose or gain any length. Two ways the student could have improved the validity was to make sure he used the same amount of weight at the end of the plastic and that the plastic was taped at the same spot at the top of the table.
I can conclude that plastic type B was superior and has more stretch ability than any other plastic type. ^p B) The student could have added more trials to secure the validity that plastic type B had the most stretchability. The student could have drastically improved the experimental design by mentioning how much the weights weigh.
Based on the students data plastics type D stretched the most in both trials. Two ways the students could have improved the experiment design is one way they could of have one more trials and see the results. Another thing they could have done was try to stretch the plastic over a different type of texture.
a. As shown by the data, plastic B was the plastic that stretched the most. All the other plastics were between10 - 20 while plastic B needed the with 22mm and 23mm. b. A control always improves the validity of date so one would help the experiment. More trials could also help so we are no outliers or mistakes.
(A)It appears that sample A was the strongest. After trial 1 it was 10mm and after trial 2 it was 12mm. Samples B and D were the weakest, sample B after trial 1 was 22mm and sample D was 20mm and after trial 2 sample B was 23mm and sample was 20mm.^p (B)One way the student could have improved the experiment is by specifically saying what plastic he was testing . Another way is by saying how much the weights weighed.
A) Based on the procedure the results were not valid. How much weight am I supposed to add. ^p B) The validity could have been improved by telling me how much weight to add or what kind of weights to use.
From the student, I can draw the conclusion that plastic types D has the least amount of stretchability ( it did not stretch at all ). The student had a very thorough procedure but they could have improved it. They could have added more weights to the plastics to see how much weight it could have taken to stretch,as well as done more than two trials for each of the different plastics.
A) From the data I am draw the conclusion that polymer B had the most stretchability. Polymer plastic B stretch an average of 22.5mm which was greater than polymer A, C and D. ^P B). To improve this experiment, the students should make sure that the amount of weight put on each plastic sample to make sure that the type of plastic was the only variable involved. Also the students should run more trials to make sure that their results were valid. With more trials, the experiment will get more results and a better chance that they are accurate.
The students conclusion would be that plastic B stretched the most. For T1 it stretched 22mm and for T2 it streched 23 mm. ^p B) The students could have done more trials. They also could of hard more plastics.
A.) Plastic type B is the stretchiest of all the plastics tested. Plastic A is the strongest and stretche the least amount. ^p B.) The student should have andesire that the plastic sheets started out the same length. Also must have had the same amount of weights applied.
a. According to the student's data, plastic type B is the most flexible of the 4 plastic types. ^P b. First, the students could have used a specific length for each plastic strip to begin with, because they will most likely stretch more if they are longer to begin with. Second, they should make sure that they add the same weight for each trial and plastic, because they are measuring chevibility, not how much weight each can hold.
Each type of plastic stretched about the same or a couple millimeters off to its counterpart in the second trial. The students could have improved the design by getting and telling specific types of plastic to use and to tell us what unit of measurement to measure the unstretched and then stretched plastic.
A conclusion that can be drawn is that plastic type B was the most stretchable of the plastics. The student could improve their experimental design would be to make sure all the different plastics were the same length before the weights were added, and make sure to include that original measurement in the data table. The student should also keep the number of weights on the plastic constant because if are plastic had more weight applied to it then another, it may appear to have stretched more.
The students have to make sure the test results are accurate and that the answers are precise.
a.) Based on the data, it can be concluded that plastic types B has the least streghth or the most elasticity because it stretched the farthest of all the other plastics. Plastic D is the second and plastic C is the third plastic with least streghth or most elasticity. Since plastic A had the least stretched legnth, it is the strongest or least plastic plastic. ^p b.) To improve the validity of this experiment, it would be wise to msure that each plastic is not only the same size, but is also taped at the exact same spot to the table, and is clamped at the same spot as well. This will allow for the removal of other ine-wencing factors. It is also important to specify the amount of weight that is used. The same amount of weight should be used for each plastic trial to ensure that weight is not a variable in the experiment.
The plastic type B had stretched the most. To improve this lab, they could of did more trials to see if their results were correct and give us what each type of plastic is and write a hypothesis based on the start of the lab to know the task at hand.
Based on the data table both trails were basically the same but they could have improve the experiment by using different weights so they could see the difference. Also, the shouldn't have add a clamp to the and of the plastic.
Plastic type D has 19 better chance of having stretchability because during both trials the amount stretched out equal, so it has a accurate chance of stretching. The student could have improved this experimental design by adding another trial and reapeating the same procedure.
Due to the data I can tell that type D streches the 2nd most but was consistent through both trials. I can also see that type A streched the least amount. Type B though, streches the most. From the data I know that type B plastic is the best because it can strech the most without breaking. This means that the chemical bonds in the polymers are mostly covalent bonds. The student could have improved their experiment by saying how much weight they added, as well as be more specific in the procedure about the plastic types.
I can conclude that plastic type A is a stronger plastic that it not very good a streching. I would add how much weight to put on the clamps and put in a 3rd trial.
a) The plastic B has the most amount that stretched. ^p b) The student could of improved their data's by using more tests and not the weights an for more time.
a) According to data table the plastics had verry little change from trial to trial for an example plastic type A for trial was 10mm and trial 2 was 12 so it stretched more the second time and for B trail 1 was 22 and trial 2 was 23. for C T1 was 14 and T2 was 13 but a changed happened on plastic C the measurement stand the same for both trials with amount of 20. B) Two ways the students had did different times for each trial. Also the clamp they should have put the plastic some where else cause maybe the clamp had added more weight.
Based on the student's data t concude that plastic type A was the strongest plastic because it streched the least amount two ways that the students could have improved the experimental design are: adding a trial 3 and recording the original length of the plastic.
a. Based on the student's data. I can conclude that the plastic type D was the strongest polymer stretching 20mm in trial one and trial 2. I can also conclude that the plastic type A was the weakest polymer stretching 10mm in the first trial and 12mm in the second trial B. One way the students could have done to improve their experiment is perform more trials. Another way the students could have improved their experiment is to record in the table how many weights used.
A.) When the four different polymer plastics were tested for stretchability a second time the results changed drastically for each material as shown in the data table. ^p B.) Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results was by increasing the time the material have to hang, and repeat the trial a third time.
"In conclusion polymer plastic ""B"" is the plastic that stretched the most in this investigation. ^p The student could have added to the results the name each polymer plastic. Also, made each polymer plastic the sam length to  start with and test each one at the same time."
a) I conclude that 12 has stretched more than 11. ^p b) Two ways the students could have improved the experiment design is by..1) they could have added the amount of weights they used. 2) They could have timed it.
A. It seems that seems that most of the bags stretched a little more in the second trial. ^p B. I think the student could have improved this experiment by doing more trials.
A Conclusion I can make from this experiment is that plastic type B stretched the longest and that plastic A streatched the least. ^p B) Two ways the students can improve there experiment is by more trials and to put the plastic type in the procedure. For example this student said take a sample of one type, instead she cold have said whch one.
I can conclude that the plastic A stratched the least from all the plastics used. And plastic B stratched the most from all the plastics used. Plastic A stratched less because it was better than plastic B. The student should have done more than 2 trials. And also should have told us the measurement of of the plastic bag. So we could know how much it was before it stratched.
Based on the student's results, polymer B was able to stretch the furthest length being 22mm in trial one and 23mm in trial two. ^p Two ways that the student could improve the experimental design is by specifying in the procedure the weight of each weight, and by performing an additional trial.
My hypothesis of I believe that plastic type B will stretch the longest was correct. Plastic type B stretched 22mm the first trial and 23mm the second trial. To improve this expiriment I would have included 2 more trials to make sure my expiriment was as valid as possible. I would also make sure that the temperature of the room I was in was same throughout the expiriment because a slight change in that could cause a big difference between the flexibility of the plastic at that time.
Based on the students data, plastic type B and C stretched the most while plastics A and C stretched the least in both trials. ^p One thing the students could have done was include the length before the weights were put on it. Another thing they could have done is tell the actual weight amount & keep it constant for all plastic types.
Some plastics are stronger than others. ^p Added more weight. ^p Rock certeni brands of waiter bottets.
Two ways the student could of improved this experiment is if he would of kept adding weights and masure how low it can go until it breaks. Another way he could of improved this experiment is instead of taping it down a edge tape it down a wall so the force can go straight down. My conclusion based in the students data is the plastic type B is the most stretchable.
"When the student tested each plastic, ""A"" stretched 2 times more than before. ""B"" only stretched once more, ""C"" went down 1 in the second trial, but ""D"" stayed the same. The way the student could of improved there experiment, would be if they graph each trial for each plastic, so we could see if it increased, decreased, or stayed the same."
A.) A conclusion I've drawn according to this table would be that plastic type A is a stronger type of plastic. ^p B.) 2 ways to improve the experiment would be to add more trials, and to have more time of the hanging weights and plastic.
The conclusion I got for the lab is that there can't be one. We don't know the original lengths of plastic. We only have the two lengths after they were stretched. ^p 1 improvement they should make is to add the original length of the plastic . Another improvement would be to change the amount of weight on the plastic.
Plastic type B streched the most at 45mm over the two trials, and Plastic A streched the least at 22mm. ^p The student could have improved the experiment by doing more trials and specify what kind of plastics they are using.
A) Plastic type B is the most stretchable plastic. In trial 1 it stretched 22 mm and in trial 2 it stretched 23 mm. ^p B) 1. The student could have had the clamps attach at the same height in each type of plastic. ^p 2. The student should have used the same amount of tape on each type of plastic.
a) Plastic type A is shown to be the strongest while plastic type B is not. Plastic type A stretched at an average of 11mm while type B stretched an average of 22.5mm.^p b) The students could have improved their experiment by listing what weight to use and tell which type of lope to use.
a) I can infer that plastic type B is the strongest as it stretched the most. ^p b) The student could have improved the experimental design by creating 3 trials and creating an average of the 3. Also the student should of listed the length of the plastics before and after stretching.
a. Based on the student's data, plastic B stretches the most and plastic A is the most rigid. ^p b. The students could have improved their experimental design by using something stronger than tape to hold the plastic They also could have done more trials since their results between the two trials varied significantly.
1) The student can conclude that plastic B stretches the most. According to the data plastic B stretched the most both trials. Twenty two mm in the first and twenty three in the second. While the other plastics stretched less.^p 2) The student should perform a third trial for accuracy and the student should keep a constant number of weights attached to each plastic.
Based on the results plastic B stretched the most than D,C,A. ^p The student could of validated his statement more by giving more amounts like how much plastic and how much weight. They could also of validated it by doing the trial a 3rd or 4th time so it was more accurate.
Plastic type A was the least stretchable. It only stretched 10-12mm. Plastic type B was the plastic with the greatest stretchability. It stretched 22-23mm. The two trials confirm this result. The students could improve their data by specifying the amount of weight for each stretch should be the same. Also, this test tests how the plastics recover after being stretched, not how far they stretch. If they wanted to test how far each stretches they should measure it with the weight attached.
a) Based on the data plastic type B was the best best plastic to resist the weight stress. ^P b) The student must have added a control group and performed more trials.
A) Based upon the data plastic B was the most flexable while plastic A was the least flexable. ^p B) The students could improve the experiment in two ways 1. Add a constant amount of weight to each clamp for each experiment. 2. Create a constant starting length for each sample and measure for the increase in length.
A conclusion that I can make based off this data is plastic type A had the biggest size difference between the two trials. One way the students could improve this experiment is starting the plastics all at the same length. This could help determine which plastic's better. Another way is by being more specific as to how many weights to put on the clamp. If one plastic has more weights than the another, it will make this experiment not valid.
My conclusion would be according to the data shown, plastic B has the highest amount being stretched. In trial one and as well as trial two. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be if they would tell us how much weights to clamp on. Also in the table include how much each weights were added on. As well as try half with weights and the other half with none.
According to the data given, plastic type B had more stretchability than plastic type A. However, the students should have stated the four types of plastics they used. Also, they should have kept the measure of plastic samples consistant.
(a) Based on the results you can tell that plastic type B can hold the most weights and plastic type A can hold the least weight.^p (B) Two ways the students could improve the experiment was to do three trials for an accurate results and have every thing the same measurement to also be accurate.
a) A conclusion in the student's data is that plastic type D stretches more than the other plastics do. ^p b) The student could have improved by adding on the procedure what types of plastics to use. Also the student could have added how much were the weights he used.
From the data presented that plastic type B can be stretched the farthest. But to improve this experiment I would do more trials to make it more accurate. Also changing the environment could improve the experiment. By controlling the temperature you can find out which plastic stretches farther in a hot environment or what stretches farther in a colder environment.
Based on the student's data, plastic type B stretched the most. In T1 it stretched 22mm and in T2 it stretched 23mm. On the other hand plastic type A stretched the least. In T1 it stretched 10mm and in T2 it stretched 12mm. So therefore type B and type D were pretty close to one another. ^p One way the student could have improved the experimental design is by specifying the amount of weight attached to each clamp. Another way is by also specifying the amount of the edge taped to the table.
a, The conclusion is that plastic type D is more stretchable than the most stretchable plastic A. ^p I'd improve this they should have included how much weights was put into each bug and also measurement of the bag before they do the experiment.
a. Plastic type B has the most stretching ability. As well as plastic A having the least. ^p b. 1. They could have specified which plastics they used, not just A,B,c &d.  2.  They could tell us how much weight they put on the clamps.
Plastic B is the most ductile, followed by plastics D, C, and A, respectively. When discussing the validity of the experiment, it is best to have an average of the two trials. Also, this person did not include the initial length (unstretched) of the plastics. They should have all been cut to the same length to start with.
Based on the data, I can conclude that plastic A+B stretched more than C+D. The student could have improved the validity of this experiment by conducting more trials. With more trials it is easier to take a more accurate average. Next, the could also say the type of plastic. Instead of saying A, B, C, D their experiment would be better developed. Easier for the reader to follow. This is what can be concluded from the data, along with what could be improved throughout the experiment.
Based on the data you can draw of conclusion of plastic type D not stretching from T1 OR T2. The plastic measured 20mm both trials.The student also could have included how much plastic is being used.The students also should have included how much many weights you hold on to the clip.
A)In conclusion it is clear that plastic type A stretched the least over the five minutes. The plastic that was the stretchiest was plastic B.^p (B)Add a control with no weight added and a third trial.
I conclude that polymer B had the highest rate of stretchability of 22mm for t1 and 23mm for t2. ^p The student could have added a control group and the student should have told us how much weight to add.
a. The data wasn't a clear statement and is inconclusive and they need another trial.^p b.) They could have tested it one more time and if they do they test would be conclusive and be able to draw a conclusion.
a. Plastic B has the greatest ability to stretch because it stretched the most in T1 and T2. ^p b. One way to improve the experiment would be to specify how long each sample is at the beginning of each trial and have them all the same initial length ( i.e 20mm ). ^p another way to improve this experiment is to specify an exat weight to be clamped to each plastic sample ( i.e. 100 grams ).
A) Both Trial 1 and Trial 2 are basically the same and their constant to each other their wasn't a big change.^p B) Maybe for step 4 they could add more time and get heavier weights.
For the polymer investigation lab experiment my conclusion from the data is that plastic type B was the most breack resitance and streched the most at 22, 23 mm. Two ways the students could op improved the experiment is in procuder one. It said to measure the length should be a certain lengths for all the plastics. My second thing is how heavy are the weights in the experiment that hung on the bag.
According to the student's data, plastic type B had the greatest capability of stretching because it stretched an average of 22.5 mm. Plastic type A only stretched and average of 11 mm. One way the students could change the experiment is by cutting each plastic sample length may be a contributing factor affecting results. Another way to improve the experiment is by taping all the plastics at the same place on the table, so an equal amount of plastic is hanging of the edge.
A-
In total we came a conclusion that plastic type B stretched the furthest in both trials I and II and plastic A stretch the least in trials I and II. ^p Two ways the student could have improved the experiment design and/ or results was by stating how many the weights were and did more trials.
Based on the student's data, plastic A stretched the least amount. Plastic B stretched the most. Plastic D stretched the same amount of 20 mm during trial 1 and trial 2. To improve the experimental design the student should have started off with all the plastic types being the same length before starting the experiment. Another way to improve the results would be to use all the same weights added to the clamp each time. Different weights can cause different results.
To conclude this experiment. I would state that plastic B stretched the most. In trial 1 it stretched to 22 and in trial 2 it reached 23mm. Compared to plastic A reriching 10mm. To improve the students experiment I would have them make sure that when they put the plastic bag dawn they put it at the same space for a more accurate answer. And lastly, they could hold more trials to improve validity of the experiment.
(A) The polymer experiment looks it went very well. Each plastics amount that was stretched was all around the same number for both trials. Two types of plastics increased after the first trial one type of stay the same amount, and one type of plastic decreased after the first trial. ^p (B) I don't think the student needs any thing to improve this experiment.
a) As a conclusion based on the data T2 plastic tests were more elastic than Ti. ^p B) The student could improve this by addressing how many weights were used and allow them to hang for at least two minutes more and to get new plastic tap instead of using the remaining 3.
Plastic type B was the most stretchy and stretched the most in trial 1 and trial 2. The student could have added a control in these and also he could have done more trials for each separate type of plastic.
a.Based on the data I concluded that plastic B was the best plastic in trial 1 it measured 22 mm and trial it measured 23mm meaning it was the sturdiest plastic. ^p b. The student could have measured the plastic before doing the experiment, making it a free trial, and the students could have added the weights and see how much weight it could hold before it fell to the floor instead of waiting for 5 minutes.
(A) Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic types A and B are stretchable; while plastic types C and D made no improvement. ^p (B) A way the experiment and validity could have been improved is by allowing the weights to hang longer. Another way is to try and measure the polymer plastic more than once after being pulled.
A. I conclude that plastic B worked the best because it held in most weight like 22,23 and the lowest was 10,12 so terefore plastic B works the best. ^P B. What they could have done was add more trials or change the type of cup.
a) Plastic type B is the strechiest. ^p b) The students could have done more trials. The student could have put in the a verages to chart in order to make an easier comparison.
a) Plastic type B and D are better to use because they stretch the stretchiest. Plastic B can stretch up to 20mm at most while plastic D can stretch up to 23 mm at most. Plastic C and plastic A can stretch the least because plastic C can stretch up to 14mm at most while plastic A can stretch up to 12 mm at most. ^p b) Two ways they would have improved the experiment is by adding more trials and telling what each plastic actually was.
a) I can conclude that T2 did better than T1 and that plastic type B did better than A,C,D. ^p b)
A conclusion based on the student's data is that plastic type B stretched the farthest over all because in the data it says it stretched 22mm and 23 mm, as where the other plastics did not stretch as far. ^p Two ways the students could have improved their experiment is by having a control, and by giving an exact measurement for how much plastic you should use because if there is a larger piece, it could look as if is stretched farther than it really did.
Plastic B has the greatest stretchability.^p The student can improve his experiment if he does more trials, uses different types of weights, increases the hang time, and uses one more plastic.
Based on the data the B type plastic is the most stretchable. In the first trial it was stretched 22mm and in the second 23mm. The student could improve the experiment by through, if he tells us which amount of weight he used. Also the student could try the experiment for a longer period of time and then do this experiment than twice.
a). The students could conclude that plastic B is the most stretchable out of the four plastics because it ended up the longest in both trials, after it was stretched. ^p b. One way to improve this experiment would be to specify in step 4, how many pound of weight are being stretched. This would make sure that in each experiment it is the same amount of weight that is pulling the plastic down. Another way would be to maybe collect data over one minute intervals.
Plastic type B had the most stretchability because it stretched further than any other plastics for both trials. The student should have done another trial and have a control group.
Two ways the students could have improved this experiment could have been by telling me what they were using as weight. And also, how they were measuring the plastic after the trial was over.
In conclusion, this experiment is not accurate because it did not list the type of plastics that would be used for this experiment. The time was not even recorded. There has got to be evidence & throughout this experiment. For plastic type D, the amount stretched was the same by 20 min. I want to know what type of materials were used. ^p The student could have recorded the time and also show the type of materials that were used throughout the experiment.
Plastic type B stretched the furthest in both trials-meaning that it had the largest stretchability. One way that the student could have improved the experiment would be to specify, (and include in the procedure or clarify in this data table) if that was the the dermensions of his plastic samples. That way, same, the able would be the results were strictly describing and comparing the stretchability of the samples, and there were an outside source trying the outcome. Another way he could improve the validity of his lab, is regulate how much weight he added to the clamp and a lot include that in his procedure or data table in order to present his experiment more clearly.
a: The more weights added to sample b and a, the more they stretched. Plastic C shrunk as weight was added to T1. Plastic D could have be stretched. ^p b.1. The student could give the starting lengths so there was something to compare the results to. ^p 2. The students could have mention how many weights were added, each how much weight was pulling on the plastic.
A conclusion I can make is trial plastic type D is the most stretchable and type A is the least stretchable. The student could have improved the experiment by indicating and using a specific amount of weights that is unchanging between plastic types and trials. Also, the student could have indicated and used a certain length and width of each plastic that is the same for each trial and type of plastic.
a.) Plastic type B stretched the greatest amount and therefore held the most weight. ^p Two ways the students' could have improved their experiment are by including the much each weight weighed and the exact length of each plastic used to validate their results. A constant variable was not included.
a) Based on the students data plastic type B was stretched longer than any other plastic type. ^P b) Two ways the studen could have improved the experimental design was at given what type of plastic they used and to provide the amount of weigh they added to each clamp (grams lbs, o2, etc..)
A. It seems that in 11 the most ductile polymes is plastic type B at 22cm. For 12 it is again plastic type B at 33cm. So it seems type B polymes is the ductule polymes. ^p ^p B. To better enhance the results of the polymer expirement then shouldue incuid the length of tht polymes unstreched.
For both trials they had similar results. They could have improved their experiment by adding more weights instead of keeping them the same.
In my polymer investigation, I discovered that plastic type B had streched the most in both trial with 22mm in trial 1 and 23mm in trail 2. The plastic type to stretch the least was type A with T1 being 10mm and T2 12 mm. One way the could of improved the validity of the results is to make a average of both trials. Also another way is to say how much weight is being used to show consistency. Finally, they need a control with no weight because the clamp effects the data.
A conclusion for this experiment could be type T2 had been the strongest for the 1st two trials and then type T1 started lasting longer and in the end they stayed the same. Still showing that type T2 was the best choice. It showed that in the end type B was the strongest. The students could have improved their experiment by naming the types of bags brand they were testing  and they also could have clamped the bag a different way for example taping it to both sides and putting weights.
This instigation has showed that the polymer from plastic type B was the most strechable than the rest. This experiment could've been altered by adding that each weight should have been carefully placed especially towards the end. There should've been a certain amount of weights put on so that the measurement of the plastics were done fairly.
The conclusion of the investigation could be that plastic A was the best because when weights were added didn't stretch that much compared to the other plastics. Two ways the student could've improved the experiment is by adding the same weights to each plastic and when starting the experiment use plastics with the same length.
plastic type B has the highest stretchability as it stretched 22 and 23mm, the furthest. Plastic type A is the least stretchable it only stretched 10 and 12mm, the least out of all. This experiment would be more validif the student had 3 trials instead of only 2, to rule out any problems. The student should have also specified the amount constant length of plastic.
a) Plastic type B has the most stretchability in all plastic samples, and plastic type A has the least. b). He could repeat the lab more and increase variables tas.
The conclusion came out to be that the 2nd trial wasn't really that much at a difference between trial 1. Most of them was 2 or 1 difference. D stood the same.
My conclusion is plastic type B is the most stretchy. In T1 it stretched to 22m and in T2 it stretched to 23. The least stretchy would be plastic type A. In T1 it got to 10 and in T2 it got to 12. I order of the stretchiest would be B, D, C, and A. They could have taken some time of step 4 and did one to two more trails.
In conclusion two ways the students could have improved the experiment design is to add a weight to the clamp and let them hang for more time. Also another way the student could have improved the design is to add the same weights to the plastic.
(a) Based on the experiments, plastic type A is the strongest of all plastics, plastic B is the weakest. B is the weakest because it stretched the most and this could be because the plastic is thin, while plastic A was more thick: instead of a linear polymer like B, plastic A was probably a tratched polymer with many different bonds. ^P (b) To improve the expirement, the students should have use the same amount of each plastic to test. The size of the plastic adds another variable to the expirement. They should also specify which weights they use and should make the weight for each plastic constant.
I think plastic D is the strongest because it's the highest weight and they are both even in trial 1 and 2. ^p The first thing they can change is add a few more trials so they can really see if it stays the same or changes. Another way is to add more weight to each piece of plastics.
Plastic B can stretch the most. They could've said the weight of the weights are used.
B) The student could have possibly added more weight to each trial that they did to get more reasonable and noticeable results. The results shown below aren't as aromatic as you can see. Also, the student could have added more time for each time he repeated the investigation.
"Based on the data I believe that plastic ""B"" has the best stretchability and its strong. ^p The students could have added a trial 3 just so the experiment could be accurate and instead of cutting all the plastics yourself get precut so they all be the same size."
"The conclusion is plastic type have 10 and 12 amounts stretched. The two ways the students ""Take  a sample of one type of plastic, and measure its length, and add weight to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes."
Based on the students data you can tell that plastic type ,B,was the strongest type of plastic based on the students data. Not only that plastic type ,B, was the strongest, it stretched the farthest too. Two ways the student could have fixed their experimental design is by the following ways. The student should have told, how heavy the weights were. Also the student should have told hoe much weights were needed in their experimental design.
This data is not accurate becaus they got a different number all the time and they only got the same number once.
Nor.
Based on the student's results, it can be concluded that plastic type A stretched the most and has the most stretchability. However, their experiment contains many variables so this conclusion may not be necessarily true. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design would be to make all the plastic types the same initial length, and then to record how much they stretched. This would make the experiment more valid. Secondly, they should have more than two trials to improve the validity of the results.
a) Plastic B is the stretchiest polymer plastic because of the amount of mm it stretched in the span of five minutes. ^p b) The students needs to make each sample of plastic the exact same size and to improve the validity the could complete a third trial.
Plastic type B stretched the longest of them all with 22mmfor its first trial and 23mmfor the second trial. They could have improved the experimental design by measuring to make sure that one type of plastic isn't longer than another type. They also could have done another trial for more accurate results.
A) Plastic B had the greatest lengths in both trials. ^p B) The students could have used more weight and they coud do the experiment over again to get better results.
We know that plastic type b stretched the furthest. They could have said how long the plastic was when they started. They could have put the names of the types of plastics.
Plastic type B stretched the most. One way the students could of improved the experimental design and validity is that they should of told how long it was before they tried and stretch it. A second way they could improve it is tell you what type of plastic they used.
A- Based on the students data I conclude that plastic type B is the most flexible, type A is the least, and type D remained the same throughout the trials. ^P B- The studed could have improved the experimental design and validity of results by, adding heavier weights to the experiment, and extend or shorten the 5min time period.
I don't think that's a valid answer but do to their conclusion depending on the plastic it could either increase or decrease in size.
a) The second try has almost the same amount of stretchability the first try has. ^p B) When added weights allow them to stay for more than 5 minutes. ^p Or they could of stretched it out more wider.
A)The strongest polymer would be plastic type B. It is plastic type B because it stretches the most out of all the other plastics in both trials.^p (B)One way that you would increase the validity would to measure how much a plastic stretched when you put the clamp on it. Another way to further validity the experiment is to do a lot more trials for more results.
A. Based on the data plastic type B stretched the most, while plastic type A stretched the least. This tells me that plastic type B is the most stretchable. ^P b. They could have added some sort of control and added one more trial. Both would help improve the accuracy of the results.
a) Plastic type B has the most stretchability with a difference of 2 to 3 mm with type D that has the second most stretchability followed by type C with a difference of 10-8mm with type B, and type A with a difference of 4-1mm with type B. b) He should have specified the total weight of the weighs and clamp he used to stretch the plastics. It also could have measured all dimensions length, width, heights of the plastic types rather than just the length.
Plastic type B is the type of plastic you want to put heavy products in because it is more durable than plastic type A which stretches only 12mm, unlike plastic type B which is 23mm. ^p One way the students could have improved the experiment is by giving the amount of how much the weights weighed. Also, give the height of the table top to the floor.
A) Based on the data, plastic B was the most strethible plastic. This is because, on average, it stretched 22.5mm in length. The next highest amount stretched, by plastic D, was an average of 20mm in length, showing that plastic B stretched the most. B) One way the student's could've improved their design is by adding a third trial. This could help make sure there was no faulty data, such as an outlier. They also could've written the amount of weight that was stretching the plastics. Otherwise, for all the & prove they could've been changing these weights, which would've given them 2 independent variables, therefore, making their experiment invalid.
One conclusion you can draw is that plastic sample B has the best stretchability. ^p The students could have made this better /or more valid by having a third trial as well. And state how much weight is being added to the plastic.
A.Based on the student's data plastic D is the best plastic type to use for stretchability.^p (B)Students could have improved the experimental design or validity of results is by saying the type of plastics they used. Ex: kitchen wrap, grocery bag, cooking wrap etc. They should mention/ add the weight of each clamp used for each plastic wrap. And at last have more trials.
Based on the student's data, I can conclude that plastic B stretched the farthest on both trials and that plastic A stretched the least. The student could have improved the experimental design by naming instead of labeling the plastic type. That would have given more information and also naming the types of plastics would have given us an idea of how the polymer plastics influence its stretchability. Also, for the validity of the results the student could included time and more trials.
a. This base on the types of bag. ^p b. We could use anothe plastic type and will try the amount of stretching.
A) Plastic type B stretched the most at 22 mm and 23 mm . Plastic type A stretched the least with 10mm and 12 mm. ^p B) The students could have improved there experimental design by saying what type of plastic it is. Another way they could've improved is by saying the repeating steps.
Based on the the student's data, a conclusion would be that sample B is the stretchiest, also, materials  C and D have good stretchability, as long as you don't stretch it twice. One way they could improve would be that instead of measuring the substances once you take the clamp off, measure it with it on because once you take it off, it will be shortened a little. Another way could be to clarify how much weight to add onto each materials.
(a) Based on the data I can conclude that some of the plastics increase by 1 or decrease by 1. ^p (B) To improve the investigation the student should have added another trial to see how it improve.
"In conclusion, plastic type B was the strongest out of all the plastic types. It stretched the most. Plastic type A was the weakest. ^p These students could have improved their experiement by writing ""record your data"" in the procedure after each trial. Also they could have created a graph to show their results in a clearer way."
A conclusion I've made based on the students data is all of the plastics increased the stretch except for plastic type C that decreased. I also saw that plastic type B stretched the most. Two ways the student could have improved this experimental designs was by adding more trials and by using different kind of weights.
Based on the student's data plastic B both trials had the most millimeters for the amount the plastic stretched. Plastic B first trial had 22 mm and the second trial had 23 mm. Also plastic D was the second plastic to have the most millimeters for plastic stretched. At trial one it was at 20mm also for trial two . One way the students could have improved their experiments is by letting us know if were suppose put weights in one at a time or how many. Also, for the second trial the time to allow the plastic to hang could of decrease or increase.
"According to the results, polymer ""A"" is the strongest. It could hold the most weight, without stretching. The more a polymer streched, the closer it was to breaking, so that is why ""A"" was the strongest. The student could have improved the experimental design and validity of the results is to insure that they are using the name type of polymer for each one and that they are adding the same amount of weight to each polymer. That will improve the results."
Plastic stretched the most it had stretched 22 mm and 23mm. Plastic A stretched the least it stretched 10mm and 12mm. The students would have improved they experiment by writing more details like writing what was the begging length and write how much the weights weighed. They also could have put an experimental control like using a piece of metal instead of plastic.
b) 1. Perform the second trial different than the first. ^p     2. Repeat with fresh plastic. ^p     3. Add more than one types of plastic.
It can be concluded that plastic type B is the stretchiest of the 4 plastics, and that plastic type A is the least stretchiest. Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design was by doing more trials to data in more results, and by specifying the exact mass of the weights hanging from the plastic.
Plastic type A stretched the least. They could have made this environment better by telling all this you what the plastics were. They could have said how much weren't they used. They finally could have said what the starting length should be.
From this experiment, I can conclude that plastic type B stretches the most and plastic type A stretches the least. ^p Make all the other plastics the same size of the first one. They also could of made another trial with a diffrent set sample of each plastic.
In conclusion plastic type B was streched the most in trial one and in trial two. To improve this experiment about polythers plastics for stretchability would be to use a different way to show the data. For example a graph chart. Another way to improve this experiment would be to record the length of the plastic without having it stretched.
a.) The student's data shows that the type B plastic is the most stretchy while type A plastic is the least stretchy. Type C is almost the same firmness as A, and D has almost the same stretch as B. ^p b) The students could have improved their experiment by stating the weight of the weights they used, to make sure they used the same weight for each plastic type. They could have repeated the experiment more, to validate their results.
A) In conclusion, each A,B,C and D had different results. A and C stretched more. Both trial 1 and 2 had different answers accept plastic type D it reamred the same. ^p B) To improve this experiment students could of made more trials for more accurate answers. Also, repeat the steps.
They added up around each other, meaning the stretched all almost the same all plastic it was the same both trials. ^p They could put range info on the data table and they could of describe the procedure better.
From the data I concluded that type D plastic type holds its plastic under weight staying at 20mm, and type A plastic type was the worse dropping 2mm. They should've test the bags wit a variety of weight. Also I would've done one more trial to see if the numbers stayed constant.
Based on the student's data, plastic type B stretched the most compared to plastic type A, C, and D. Therefore, B has the most stretchability. Two ways to improve the experimental design are to make sure each plastic starts at the same length and that the same amount of weights are used for each plastic.
A conclusion I have drawn is that plastic type B is the best plastic in this experiment. I know this because the data shows that it had stretched the most compared to the other three plastics in five minutes. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and the validity of the result would be in perform the experiment again and make sure the same weights are used. By performing the experiment again the data would be shown four times instead of two and for once accurate. By using the same weights, we would know that the plastics are stretched fully.
"A.Plastic B stretched the most, D the second most, C the second least and A the least.^p B. for one student cased have included more trials only two trials is not that many and could have found and take results. More trials would have increased the validity. For another, the inident have specified the weight of the ""weight""in the procedure leaving that unspecified leaver that variable incontroiled, therefore therefore specifying the weight of the weight would have been highly been held to both the experimental to design and the validity."
Based on the data plastics type A stretched the least. Followed by B,D,C. Plastic A stretched the most with two mm. One way they could improve it is to test it more times. They could also have mentioned the weight of the weights he used to stretch the plastic.
In conclusion plastic type B stretched the most while A and C were approximately the same. D stayed the same for both trials (20mm).^p The students could have preformed a 3rd trial with the plastic type. Also they could have let the plastics hang longer than 5 minutes.
B, tell wat the a weightt of weights were.
That plastic A was more durable than plastic B.^p For one he/ she could been more specific with the plastic type and the amount of weight needed to be used.
The conclusion that I have draw from this data is that two plastic did stretch while one stay the same and on other seemed to shrink. Two ways that this student could have improved the experiment is by having what type of plastics that is going to be tested all the same length before the hanging them of the table and the amount of weight including there mass to improve the validity of this experiment and it results.
a. The conclusion is that plastic type d is the material that has stretched the most plastic types A stretched the least. One way that the student could have improved would be by adding a timer into the procedure. Also to have the same weights of each plastic.
a) From this data, one can conclude that plastic type B stretched the most in both trials. The data supports that this polymer plastic has the most specified what length the four plastics should all start at. In order to increase the validity of the experiment. They could also have specified what amount of weight so that each plastic would be pulled by on equal amount.
Plastic type B has the greatest stretchability out of the other four. The student could have done more trials. They could of also tell us a specific weight.
Based on the students data, the plastic type A of trial 1 was stretched less than the plastic type B of trial 1, from A 10mm and B 22mm. Also the trials have different results of type A, from trial 1 plastic type A stretched. 10mm and trial 2 plastic type A stretched 12mm. The student could have improved the experiment design by adding more trial and measure the amount of weight.
The student's data revialed that plastic A could be most restitence to stretching. One way the students could have improve this experiment is add more trials. Another way is add control to the experiment.
A:) If you hang weights on plastic type B then it will stretch at least 2-3 inchs. ^p B:) They could of told of what type of plastics they used and which one was the control.
By the data given in the table plastic type A was the most stretchable while plastic D was the strongest and didn't stretch at all. The student could've improved the experiment by stating how much was the weight applied on the plastic, also they could've used a better way to stick the plastic on the table.
In this experiment plastics A and C where the ones that streched least B and D streched the most Plastic A in T1 streched 10 mm and in T2 it streched 12 mm. Plastic B streched 22 on T1 and 23 in T2 C streched 14 in T1 and 13 T2. D streched 20 in T1 and 20 in T2. So the are that streched most was Plastic B. I think the students could of improved the experiment by changing the way the streched to how fast you can rip and puncture also put less plastics to try.
a) Based on the student's data, plastic type B stretched the most, while type A was the least stretchable. ^p b) 2 ways the student could have improved are, one, tell what the length of each plastic was to begin with, and make sure they are all the same length, and also different lengths of time could have been tested, like 10 minutes instead of 5 minutes.
A) From the student's data, we can conclude that plastic type B has the most stretchability, stretching an average 22.5mm per trial, compared to type D's 20mm, type C's 13.5mm and type A's 11mm. ^p B) One way the student could have improved is by increasing the number of trials carried out which will increase data accuracy and lessen the effect of outlians. A second way he could've improved is by stating the weight of the weights he used. Not specifying this could lead to variations of data, and almost impossibility to replicate the experiment.
a) Plastic type B was the stretchiest, and plastic type A was least stretchiest. ^p b) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design and validity of the results are; one, do a third trial for each plastic: and two, test a control which will not stretch.
a) based on the data T'd like to include that plastic D had streched the longest of all. I can also see that all the plastics streched except for plastic C... it was the only plastic that got shorter rather than strech. ^P b) I think that the only improvement that this experiment needed was to possibly increase the tim 5more minutes before sarting the next trial. Validity on the experiment with no changes is correct because the use extra trials.
A) The conclusion isthat, plastic type B has more stretchability than the others. ^p B) Two way the student could have improved the experiment was that they should have repeat the experiment multiple times to make sure that it is acurate and they didn't put time on how many minutes the plastic should be streched.
Based on student data, I noticed that the trial two (T2) plastics stretched longer then most plastics in trial one (T1). I believe the students could have made the time period that they were stretched for longer. I believe some plastics could have stretched more. Also, I think that in their procedure, they should have discussed the amount of weights they put on the clamp for future reference.
A) That for the first trial plastic type B stretched more for the second trial plastic type B stretched 1 more mm and it ended up the most plastic that has stretched.^p b) The two ways the student could have improved the experiment is by having more trials and by using the types of plastics that they were using.
A conclusion I can make is that all the plastic types and trials were all about the same thing.^p Hang, the clamps for more than 5 minutes, attach clamp to top edge.
Based on the data provided by the studence, I have concluded that plastic type B streched the most in both trial 1 and trial 2. ^p One way the studentce could have improved the experiment was by having a continuat for example they could have done a third trial  to see if there was anymore change. The second way the studentce could have improved the experiment was by giving the length of each plastic to see if they were the same.
"A conclusion I draw from the data is that plastic type B is the most stretchable plastic of them all. The data supports this answer cause on average it stretched 2.5mm farther than the others and 11.3mm farther then plastic ""A"" two ways students could have improved results of to include more trials cause its hard to get a good average of two trials. Also I would try adding more trials with different weights, because maybe are plastic is the stretchable when at lower weight."
The two ways the student could have improved the experimental design is Repeat the procedure exactly for the remaining three plastic samples.
"A) From the experiment the students performed we can conclude that plastic type A stretched the most as compared to plastics type B,C,D because from ""T2"" it started at 10 and to T2 it went to 12. Whereas for the others it stretched only 1mm and in type ""A it stretched 2mm"". ^p B0 The students could improve this experiment by adding more trials so they could get better and more precise results. They could also be more specific about the weights and tell us what to start with, small weights and then gradually get to heavier ones or use all the same."
I dont think his stretchability investigation work. I feel that the student didnt has to exactly respect everything 3 times and they didnt have add weights to clamp and allow them hang.
I can conclude that on average plastic B was the most stretchy plastic. Validity could have been improved if the student states how heavy the weights are in step 4. Also the student could have stated an exact point on the table so that all plastics were in the same conditions to make the experiment more valid.
a) In conclusion plastic B stretched the longest while plastic A stretched the least. ^p B) The student could of told us what type of plastic to use in the procedure. The student could of also tried more trials to see if the stretched plastic changed sizes.
Based on the results, plastic type A stretched the least and plastic type B stretched the most, therefore the order for the stretchiest plastic/polymers is B, D, C, then A. The student could have used the same weight on each of the polymer. The student could have spesified how much time to allow the weight to pull on the plastics.
Based on the data. I can see that most of the plastic wraps either stayed the same or increased on the length stretched out. I can say the weights did have an impact on how long it stretched out to be overall, it was a good experiment w/ information, but there could've been improvements. Next time I would recommend trying different weights to see if the amount of weight will determined the length. Also, we can add more time to how long the weights stays on the plastic.
"I conclude from this lab that plastic type ""B"" stretched the most out of all of the polymers. This means it has more elasticity than the others. I also conclude that plastic type ""A"" stretched the least out of all of the polymers. This means it has less elasticity than the other types of polymers. ^p One way the student could improve the lab is to add more trials. That would make the hypothesis more true. Another way is by deleting human mistake, by meaning correctly and things like that."
A) After testing and collecting data I compared each result and I it either stretched by 2 to 1 mm each test sometimes it don't move.^p A. By doing more trials and by having the same amount of weight in each one.
a) Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic B has the most stretchability. The data shows that in both trials (T1 and T2), plastic B stretched 22 and 23. ^p b) The students could have done another trial to make their data more valid they also could have let the weights hang more than five minutes.
The results from the students polymer lab show that plastic type B stretched furthest in both that's then any other material. The students could have improved the experiment by telling how much weight to add to each same and by telling how to specifically add them, I.F. shortly or by just dropping the weights on the clamp. As always more trials will increase the validity of any results in a science lab.
A good conclusion I can make from the data is type A and C were the most alike and types B and D were the most alike. For example for T1 type A had 10 and type C had 14 and for T2 type B had 22 and type D had 20. The student could have improved the experimental design by telling the reader how much plastic should be hanging down the table and also he should have been told how heavy the weights were.
Based on the student's data the conclusion I have drawn up is that plastic B was the most stretchy in both trial 1 and trial 2. Plastic B streched the most out of all the plastics. Two ways this student could have improved the expirimental design was to have a constant, and to add that there are four different types of plastics not just one.
a. The conclusion would be that plastic B had the most stretchability while plastic a had the least. ^p b. Two ways they could improve their experiment would be to add more trials. Truly good experiment has at least 3 trials. Another would be to make the procedure more understandable. And they should keep the weights on for longer, this will give more extensive and accurate data.
Based on the data that has been recorded it lists that the second trial that they did with the bags was the trial where the bags were able to hold on to the weights and stretch out the most. A way that the students could of have improved their experiment would've been to add more weights and see at how much they would of ripped instead of waiting 5 minutes.
a) I came to the conclusion that plastic type B had the most stretchability out of all plastics. Plastic B was stretched to an average of 33. ^p b) The student could have improved his experimental design by conducting a third trial and telling the readers what plastics were involve]d in the experiment.
The students found that the weakest polymer is B and the strongest is A on the first trial,B stretched 22 mm and on the second trial, it stretched 23mm , However, A was the strongest because on the first that , it stretched 10 mm  and on the second  trial. it stretched 12mm without breaking. The students could have improved their  exprement by being more specific about the different polmers used, they could apply the weights onto the plastic instead of the clamps to see how much it dents the plastic, and they should do more trials.
All of the plastics stretched, plastic A stretched the least, plastic B stretched the most.^p 2 ways the student could of improved the experimental design is by doing a 3rd trial and also saying how much weight was added.
The second trial 2 of the plastic stretched a little more. One actually decreased a mm. The student should've done it a better way instead of taping it to side of the table. Also they could've have much weight they were adding to the clamp.
Based on the data documented in the table I can conclude that over that plastic type D has the most elasticity because on both trials it stretched to 20mm.Two ways that the student could have improved the design or validity could have been to: specify the amount of the weights being used and specify on what types of plastic to use.This would make the validity higher.
Based on the data table each trail for each type of plastic was fairly similar. Also from the table it is clear to see that plastic is was the most flexible as it stretched 22mm in the first trial and 23mm in the second trial. Plastic A was  the least flexible.The first trial stretched 10mm in length and in the second trial 12mm.Therefore out of all the plastics, plastic B had the greatest stretchability. However, one way the results could have been improved is by measuring the length (mm) of the plastic when they break or even after a longer period of time.This will show the true stretchability of each plastic. Another improvement could be naming types of plastic that were being future trial can be done and the best plastic could be put to good use.
a) Plastic A was 10mm long & then it reached out to 12mm plastic B was 22mm & then went to 23mm, plastic C was 14mm & then went to 13mm & plastic D was 20mm & than stayed the same. B) One way this student could have improved was to give us the types of plastic besides sayin take one sample of a plastic another way was to give examples & give more details. I say the validity is not right because if I want my store this experiment excatly from word to word then I would have gotten something different.
The conclusion based on the student's data is that plastic type B did the best out of all of the other plastic types in both trial 1 and 2. Also, two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and validity of the experiment again and to use more plastic types.
In conclusion, our hypothesis was widing because plastic type B stretched the most instead of plastic type C. ^P Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design of the results are they could have included how much weight they put on the clamps and also they could have left the weights on far mo0re than 5 minutes.
Based on the students data, the plastic type B was the plastic with the most stretchability. The group could have improved their design by specifying how much weight weighed and kept it constant by having each weight the same. Also, they should have included before and after length in their design table.
(a) Plastic B has most cross-linking because it is the strongest and stretched furthest. ^p (b) The student should have increments in which the weights are added, and how much of the plastic should be hanging off the side. Each plastic should be the same length.
A) Based on the data shown in the table. One strongest type of was plastic B. But plastic D had a costant amount of stretch. ^p B) One way the student could have improved the experimental design was by including how much weight to add. Also to compare the results with any other student who performed his same experiment.
b. The students could have improved there experiment by making diffrent data graphs. They could have also improved there expriment by solving the resolts by adding or subtracting.
a) With the given data, plastic type B has the most stretchability due to its stretches of 22mm and 23mm. None of the other plastic types stretched as much, Plastic D one the closest at 20mm. b) The student could have improved the validity of the experiment by eliminating a large variable created, which has the length of each sample at a constant length. Also, he could have measured the lengths are smaller amounts such as every minute, not every 5 minutes.
(a) Based on the students data, plastic type B is the 'stretchiest' plastic. ^p (b) Make all original lengths equal I add the same weights (undefined in the procedure). Find a way besides tape to hold the plastic.
A) My conclusion is that the expirement was very un organized and not well thought - out. ^p B)These student could have improved their expiremental design by one, telling us the materials they used like what kind of plastic objects they used like whether or not they were strechable. Just to give us more of a second thought about how theyre data came out. they could have organized their data alot better.
I conclude that after seeing the data that plastic type B is the most stretchable out of all the plastics. I say this because in trial 1, it stretched 22mm and trial 2 it stretched 23mm. The plastic that stretched the closist to that was type D, which stretched to 20mm both times. Two ways that they could have improved in labs validity is one, adding a third trial to each plastics. And two, taking the same of the trials and finding in weight stretch for each type.
a. Plastic type B stretched the farthest in both trials while plastic type A stretched the least meaning type B was more stretchability than type A. ^p b. One way the student could've improved this experiment would be to add a control group so you could see the initial lengths of the plastics. Another way would be to to add more trials to average out the stretchability.
A. Plastic type A is stronger than the rest. ^P B. There a set length and width for each piece of plastic instead of it being whatever it happens to be. A different size may mean a difference in durability and strength.
A) Based on the data table plastic type A had the most amount stretched so it is the stretches. ^p B) One thing they could have done was add weight and see which one would rip faster another thing they could of done was add more time.
a. I conclude that plastic B is the strongest with an average stretch length of 22.5 mm. Plastic A is the least stretchiest with an average of 11 mm. Plastic D is the second stretchiest with an average of 20 mm, and plastic C is the third with 13.5 mm as the average. ^p b. 1) They could have had a constant beginning plastic length. ^p 2) They could have had a standard weight of the weight and tried stretching with heavier or lighter weight for a 3rd trial to see how the weight affects the polymer.
Plastic B stretched the most out of all of the plastics. To improve this lab the students should give a specific weight to add so it is the same for all test+ should make a specific length for the plastic.
In conclusion T2 was mostly longer than T1 because T2 had more higher measure than T1. One way this student could of improve is he could of put heaver weights. Another was he could of done it was he kept reducing the tape size.
Based on the students data plastic B stretched the most with 22 mm for trial 2 and 23 mm for trial 2. These students could have improved in a lot of things. First off they could have been more specific in their experimental design. They could have been more specific and told how the weight of the weight was. They could have also added more trials to get a better result.
Conclusion 1 the stretchiest plastic was type B. Improvements they could of had more than one two trials and they could have added the original lengths of the plastic in their results. To know that all the plastics were the same length.
The conclusion that B is the strechiest and A is the least. Two way's the student could have made his experiment better was test the dip is the plastics and the width.
Based on the data, we descovered that plastic type B stretched the most after 5minutes of the weights on it with a total of 23mm stretched. ^p Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design was to add x amount more weight to the plastic to see how much it stretched the other way would be to have one or two more trials to eliminate any chance of errors.
a. Plastic type B was the strechiest plastic streching 22mm in T1 and 23mm in T2. Plastic type A was the least strechy and only streched 10mm for T2 and 12mm for T2. ^p (b) One way to improve the experiment would have been to add a trial 3 with a diffent set of weights. Second the experiments validity is off because there were no stated constants. The plastic starting length, weights added, and conditions like weather should be the same for all trials.
a. Plastic type B is the most stretchable with an average  of 22.5mm of stretchability. The least most stretchable had an average stretchability of 2.5mm less than type B of 20mm. ^p b) the student could have specified a single starting length for each trial of each type of plastic. ^p The student could have specified the weight to add.
Well fro 1 they could have named the plastics. The second way is to name why they are doing it,and finally they could have measure it was before they started testing.
(T2) Had stretched more than trial (T1) for plastic type A, B. Then (is was lower than T1 then plastic type D was exactly the sam.
"(A) I can conclude from the students data table that plastic type ""B"" had the most stretchibility. The weakest type of polymer was type ""A"". ^P (B) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design was leave the weights on for longer than five minutes, or done more trials."
A) Plastic type A stretched the most, (2mm) and type D did not.stretch at all. ^P B) All plastics started at the same length. Make sure the temperature is the same.
Polymer type C was the strongest plastic with only a difference or 1mm in two trials. This student could've listed the starting length of the plastic.
According to the student's data, plastic B stretched the most with an average of 22.5mm. Plastic D was the second most flexible because it stretched an average of 20mm, while plastic C was the third most flexible plastic because it stretched an average of 13.5mm. Lastly, plastic A stretched the least with an average of 11mm. However, these results are not valid. In order to make them valid, the students would need to use plastics that are the same length; and use the same weight to stretch. This would ensure valid results, because it would be guaranteed the same size plastic was being pulled with the same forces.
A) My conclusion would be that plastic B stretched the most because it had the farthest length's both times. ^p B) They should have put weights to make the weight even on the other side. They should've also done more trials on the other types of wrap.
3. a) Plastic type B stretched out the most between the two trials with plastic type D coming on close. ^p b. The students could've made a third trial to be more valid & or allow the weights to hang more than 5 min instead, it could've been 10 min.
a) According to this investigation, the shorter the plastic is the more it will stretch. ^p The experiment is not very valid due to the following: we are not aware of what each plastic type is. Also more trials should have been done so you could have more of a comparison between each trial. Two trials is not enough.
Two ways could have been improved is by doing group and they needed a hypothesis to know wether their question was right or wrong s conclusion is the plastic type A and D there used because they might have putten more weights on different types for the second trial.
A conclusion about this students data is plastic type B stretched the most. Two ways the student could have improved the design or validity of results is they should have said if the weights had to be the same mass. They could have also told the type of tape to use because some tapes hold up more heavier things than other types do.
3. a) Plastic A and C have very similar inatups based on the amount they stretched, and likewise with plastic B and D. ^p b) The entire procedure is vague and contains no actual numbers. One way they could have improved would be if, they specified the amount of weight they used to get this results they got; And the way , just to help the people trying to reperform this experiment this experiment would, would be to specify which platics are done at which time.
In conclusion to plastic that had the most stretchability was plastic A. It is the most flexible because the changed the most from trial 1to trial 2. It changed by 2mm. The student could have improved on there experiment by adding more trials to. Increase validity and compare the plastic from before the weights were put on. We don't know the length of the plastic at first or how much weight they used.
a) Plastic B-D on the second trial had the most stretch, than the other plastic A-C. ^p b) By doing it 3 times instead of 2.(trial) and showing the difference for example B on the the second trial stretched more than D by 3.
a) A conclusion that I can draw from the students data is that plastic type B stretched the most and plastic type A stretched the least. ^P b) Two ways the students could have improved their experimental design is one, they should have stated what four types of plastic they were using. Secondly, they should have said the amount of weights they put on the clamp.
A. In conclusion plastic B was the one who stretch the farthest in both trial. ^p B. Could have had 3 trials. Also could have under control.
a. Plastic Type  B stretched the most and plastic Type A stretched the least. ^p b.) The student could have tested each type of plastic for several different times. He also could have done more trials with each type of plastic.
According to the results shown on the table I can conclude that the plastic type B is the most stretchable. Type B stretched the most at 23 mm. Type D stretched 20mm while type C stretched 14mm. Type A only stretched 12 mm. There are many ways that the group could have improved their design. One thing the could have shown is the initial length of the plastic. Also the group could have shown how much weight they added to the clamps. This would allow me to reproduce their experiment and compare results.
a) Plastic B was definitely the most stretchy and of all the plastics. ^p B) He could have recorded how much the plastic stretched at certain intervals of time, maybe every minute. he also could have tested both plastics each to back. The same way twice in 3 trials.
a: Plastic type B had the most stretchability. ^p To improve the valedity of the results the students could have measured the plastic 2 times on each trial.
As the type of plastic changed from type A all the way to type D, the amount of stretch increased from 10mm to 23mm. ^p They could increase the amount of trials and make all plastics starting length the same.
a) In conclusion, plastic type B was stretched the farthest for both trials, and plastic type A had the least amount of stretching. ^p b) The students could have improved their experiment's by adding more trials and tell us the specific amount of weight used for each plastic.
Based on the students data, plastic type D has the most sretchability. To validate the results, the students could have done a third trial and averaged the three lengths for each plastic. They could have also specified how much weight was added and keep that consistane.
Two ways that the student could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results, the first would be to figure out what kind of plastic and then write it down on the date table. The second way would be to write down the average of the T1 and T2. A conclusion based on the student's data is which plastic stretched the most.
a. Overall plastic type b had the most stretchability amongst all of them.^p b.1  done more trials to compare with results. b2 check lengths and other measurements to see if they are correct.
This polymer investigating lacks numerical data. I can lab make a solid conclusion. ^p The students can improve the late by saying the original length of the plastic and the ending length. They can also say how much weight they are using and what plastics they are using.
The student did a good job conducting this experiment. There was an indepent variable, the type of plastic, and there were multiple trials. The weakest plastic was B, because it stretched the most, and the strongest was A, because it stretched the least.^p One way the student could have improved this experiment would be by using the same amount of weight that was stretching the plastic. Another way could be by drawing a line on the plastic so they would measure it in the same spot, start and end.
a) In conclusion, it clear to see by looking at the data that plastic type B has the most stretchability.^p b) The students could have improved the experiment design and validity of the results if they would state that they used the same types of weights for each plastic. In addition, they should have documented the length of type of plastic before beginning the procedure.
a) Plastic type a had the highest stretchability, while plastic type D had the lowest stretchability. ^P b) 1. Say the exact measure of the plastic sample (in step 1) to make them all the same so that the starting mm of the plastic would be a constant. ^P 2. Have a control group, one piece of plastic that did not have a clump on the bottom edge.
The conclusion would be that type B plastic streched the most for both trial one and two. Type D made no change, it streched the same amount for both trials. One way they could have fix their experiment was record what the length of the plastic was before the strech and the change of it. Another one was to explain the different types of plastics were.
(A) Plastic type B shows the most stretchability because T2 it stretched 22 and T2 it stretched 23. Plastic type D stretched 20mm in T1and T2. Plastic type C went from 14mm in T1 to 13mm in T2. Lastly, plastic A went from 11mm in T1 to 10mm in T2. This shows that plastic B is the most stretchable. ^p (B) The students could have shown the initial weigh of the materials and should have had the material on start of the same length.
Based on the student's data I can conclude that plastic type B was the most stretchable. ^p A way that the student could have improved the experiment is by doing 3 or 4 trials instead of 2. Also, by letting the plastics hang for 5 minutes, but also 10 minutes.
From the data of this lab, I can infer that in the second trial plastic types A and B both stretched farther than they did in the first trial. And type C didn't stretch as much as if did in the first trial, and type D stretched evenly with what it stretched the first trial. Two ways they could have made this procedure better is by doing the experiment on the same surface, and by having the same person conducting the experiment in both trials.
The polymer that has the most stretchability was plastic type B with 22 mm for the first trail and 23 for the second. Plastic type A had10 and 12, type C had 14 and 13, type D had 20 and 20. One way the students could of improved their experiment was to do threa trails.
Overall, plastic type a stretched the most. Therefore, it must be weaker than the others. One way this experiment could be improved is saying repeat experiment for plastics B, C, and D. They did not mention other plastics. Another way their experiment could be improved is that the students could add another trial to prove their results correct.
A conclusion I can draw for the stretchability for polymer plastics is that for plastic type B the stretchability must be real stretchy because for the T1 it was 22mm and for T2 it was 23mm. But for type C it stretchability went down, T1 14mm and T2 13mm. ^p The students could of improved the design by adding a T3. Also they could of used more than just four different types of plastics.
That each plastic bag does strean a little bitt. why he could of improved is how much weight he put on it. He could disol use differnt type of clamps. One last thing he could of changed is how light he hung the bags from the floor.
Based on the student's data, plastic tube ''D'' stretched the most, for T1 and T2 both trys was the same number 20. Plast type A for T1 and T2 has the lowst stretch amount.
A) Mt conclusion based on the students data is that plastic B had the more affect for its stretchability. Plastic A had the least stretchability when it comes to the weights of clamps on top of the bag. ^p B) Two ways the students could have improved their experiment is by including what types of plastic and how long do we leave the weights on top of plastic.
Based on the students data,Plastic A was streched the least at an average of 11mm. Plastic B streched the least at an average of 27.5m. After that came a plastic D with 20mm followed by plastic C at 13.5mm. The student could have improved the experimental design and its validity by doing a 3rd trial also the student could have stated whether or not the plastics started off at a constant length for all u.
They could of repeat all the steps over.
A conclusion that can be drawn based on the students data is plastic type B is more stretchable than the others because in T1 it stretched 22mm and T2 it stretched 23. The other 3 plastics didnt stretch as far as plastic B. Two ways the students could've improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results is did a third trial, and measure how far the plastic was on the edge of the table.
A. In conclusion the plastic that stretched the most was plastic type B at 22 and 23mm. The plastic that stretched the least was plastic type A at 10 and 12mm. ^p B. One way to improve this experiment is to add constants like, how many weights and how much do they weigh. Also they should do another trial and then average out the results.
a) In Conclusion, plastic type B is a better polymer plastic for stretchability: due to the fact that the first trial is stretched 22mm and the second trial it stretched 23mm. The polymer plastic that stretched the least was plastic type A. The first trial is stretched 10mm and the second trail it stretched 12mm.^p b) One way they could have improved this experimental design would be, by adding a certain ammount of weight. And another way they could improve it and prove its valid would be with a control.
Based on the student results, I can conclude that plastic type B is the most stretchable. In the data, plastic type B stretched to 22 mm on T1, and 23mm in T2. None of the other plastics had stretched as much. Then ways to improve this experiment is to add another trial and average the data. Also the student needed to tell exactly how much weight he clamped to the plastics.
a) A conclusion that can be drawn from this experiment is that plastic type B has the most stretchability. b) 2 ways the student could have improved the experimental design is by including how much weight to put on the clamps and the types of plastics used.
a) Plastic type A, stretches longer than all other types, in other words it has more stretchability. Types B+C have the same stretchability, and D has the least stretchability, had the least durability, kepping it's structure while the others did not. ^p b)1) Made all the types start out in the same length. 2) specified the amount of weight that was applied, 3) Recorded the length of the sample before stretching it.
Based on the students data some of the plastic stretched, some stayed the same and one of them even got smaller. One way they could have improved there experiment is have the plastic all the same size. Another way they could improve this is by saying how much weight they put on and keep the weight the same for all.
a) Based on the student's data, plastic type A is the least stretchable, while plastic type B is the most stretchable. Plastic types B and C fall in the middle of these two in terms of stretchability; B was more stretchable than C. ^p b) One way the student could have improved the experiment would be cutting all of the samples to uniform lengths and widths, rather than simply measuring what their length already was. The student also could have specified how much weight was being added to each sample.
a) Plastic type D seems to be more accurate of stretchability because after both trials T1 and T2 the amount stretched is the same at 20 mm. ^P b) One the experiment could be proved is to repeat the experiment. A second way is to make an hypothesis before starting the experiment.
A=is not much of diference of T1 to T2 is only 1 or 2 mm so is really acuret. B= they shouded have more plastic type and more trials.
a. A conclusion that can be made is that they used plastic B, then plastic B will stretch the most.^p b.More trials and use more plastic types.
The conclusion I draw to this investigation is plastic type B as the most stretchability compared to all the others and plastic A as the least stretchability. ^p Two ways the student could've improved this experiment would be a clearing with the for example how much weight and also mention what type of materials needed to conduct this experiment.
Well as we see on
The conclusion it draws from this is that they.
Plastic type B was the stretchiest plastic type. It listatcched a total of 45 mm plastic type D was second it stretched  a total of 40 mm plastic C was the 3rd stretchiest it stretched a total of 27 mm and plastic A was the least stretched it stretched a total of 22 mm.
Conclusion: The stretchability of a type plastic is dependent on what type of polymer it is. Plastic A and B were clearly strong than plastic C & D most likely they were made of very different polymers. ^p The students could have improved their design by specifying the weight and using the same weight and clamps every time. This would ensure more precision.
A) A conclusion I can draw by looking at the student's data is that the type B plastic stretched the most after the two trials. ^P B) The two ways these student could have improved their was by added more trial. Also they should have established a starting length of the plastic.
A) In conclusion, plastic B was the most stretchable at an average of 2200mm, while plastic A was the least stretchable at an average of 11mm. ^p B) The student could have known the weight of the clamps, and add that on to the amount of weight added. Also, they could have made sure all the weight in the clamp were the same for each plastic.
a)Plastic type B stretched most, D second most, C third most, and A stretched the least making B the most stretchable and A the least. b) One way to improve the experimental design and/or validity is to tell which types of plastics they used another is to tell how much weight they added in the clamp.
Plastic type B was the weakest and stretches the most, a way to improve the experiment would be to designate what each type of plastic is and how much weight to use on the clamp.
A) After reviewing the data I have figured out that plastic type B for both trials 1,2 the plastic stretched the longest. Trial 1= 22mm trial 2= 23mm, plastic type B is the least change. B) 2 ways they could of improved there experiment is do a control with all plastic types with the same weight for all of them. Also they could of hangeach plastic for different lengths of time do 2 trials one of 5mins 1 of 10.
Based on the students data after putting the weights over clamps the amount of stretchability decreased and the difference the between the trials went down one by one. Students could of improved the experimental design by weighing the weights and calculating how much preasure would be on the clamps. They also could of said the specific plastic samples they were using.
a) Based on the data show plastic type B was the stretchiest material and plastic type a is the least. b) In there data table they could have given how much weight was appiyed the the material. In the procedure the students could have been more specific on the unite used and elaborated more on performing the procedure to make it easier for the next person to use it and under stand.
A) On the trial A,B,C and D stretched quiet long and plastic B is the most longest so plastic B is the best from all. On the second trial, the result is not a lot difference from the first trial, plastic A,B and C stretched 1.2 mm more and plastic D still the same. B) Students should put the original measurement for all the plastics and put in the data table. The students should leave the weights on the clamp to hang there longer than 5 minutes to see if those plastics could stretched even more.
The students sould had said what type of plastic they used and if they were the same, and say what was the main reason for us to no how much a the plastic streched.
(a) A conclusion that could be drawn based on the students data is that plastic type B can stretch the most with T1 being 22mm and T2 being 23. And plastic type A stretching the shortest with T1 at 10mm and T2 at 23mm. ^p (b) The student should have made sure that all plastics strips are the same length and the student should have tape all the stips in the same spot.
Plastic type B stretched the longest out of plastic A, C, and D. On the first try streching 22mm and the second time streching 23mm. To make the experiment better the student should have done the experiment a couple more times because plastic type D streched 20mm both times. The second way he or she could make it better is by telling how much weight he added on the clamp.
a.) According to the student's results, type B plastic was longer in length and stretchable. Plastic A seemed to be the least stretchable butonly at a length of 10-12 mm. ^p b.) The student could have been to say how much weight to put in the clamp so it could be a constant variable. Also, the student could have put the initial length of the plastic with the results to see which plastic had stretched the most.
a. After time the maximum stretch of a palmer goes down and becomes stronger. ^p b. He could of made the laties longer of tell how much waits you were adding.
A. Based on the finding the stretchiest plastic is type B, stretching 22mm in T1 and 12mm in T2. The least stretchy would be type A, stretching 10mm in T1 and 12 in T2. ^p B. 1. They needed to specify the size of the plastic samples ( for example 3in*5in). If they weren't all the same size the results would be inaccurate. 2. They also needed to specify the weight without it, one sample could stretch more having 10 pounds on it, than on sample with only 2 porkets on it.
In conclusion, plastic type B had stretched the farthest. The two types were both pretty constant with ie newl have menis. A way this student could have improved this was by telling us how what the original measurement the plastic type was. Therefore we could see how much it's stretched. I think these types could have done another trial to make the experiment a little more valid.
a) I conclude that the it plastics tested showed some increased in length when stretched.I believe that the plastics way that they were stretched increased in length over to me that what I found in this experiment.^p b) I believe they should have identify the different plastics.I also believe that they should of said how much weight the plastic was holding and many. That what should of been added.
With the data recorded. I know that plastic type B is the most it stretchable of the  four plastics type I tested. ^p It would of been wise to state what the plastics were for and how much the weight's weighed.
The student is conclusion is A student performed the following investigation to test four different polymer plastics for stretchability and the two ways the student could is the student not talk procedure polymer and attach a clean to the bottom edge on the plastic sample.
In conclusion in the 1st trial all of the plastics here higher. In the second trial plastic A increased by 2mm, plastic B increased by 1mm, plastic C increased by 1mm, and plastic D stayed the same. I believe the amount of plastic stretched in the second trial depends on the type of plastic.
a) Plastic type B was the most stretchable plastic used because it was stretched longer than any other plastic in both trials. Plastic  type A had the least stretchability with 10mm for the first trial and 12mm for the second. ^p The student could have improved his/her experiment by keeping these two variables constant would make the experiment very reliable.
In the second trial, the length for plastic A and B went up. For plastic C the longer length was 14 in the first trail. But in plastic D, the amount stretched stood exactly the same. Two ways the student could have improve this experimental design is drawing a line graph and give the data table a little more details.
a) Based on the students data I've concluded that plastic B was the stretched plastic. ^p b) The student could have improved the design by adding a control group, and adding more trials.
In conclusion, plastic type D stretched the most out of the samples. Plastic A, on the other hand, was the least stretchable.^p The student could've specified the types of plastics they were testing. They also should have specified the amount of weight they were adding to the clamp. They didn't say how to measure the length of the plastic types.
Based on the students data I can conclude plastic type B was the stretchiest polymer. The students could have improved there experimental design by telling us the type of polymer plastics they used, and they should have indicated in the graph how much weight was used on each type of polymer to stretch it out.
Overall plastic A is the most durable. Plastic B was the weakest in both tests. They could have improved their experiment by having there trials for more data. They could have added more weight in the second trial.
The conclusion im gonna draw based on the students data is that there amount of stretched (mm) could go up if they keep investigating. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and /or validity of the results is that first take a sample of one type of plastic and measure its lenght. And second repeat the procedure exactly for the remaining three plastic samples.
The amount that plastic type A stretched was 10mm on the first trial and 12mm on the second trial. Plastic type B stretched 22mm, then 23mm the second time. Plastic type C stretched 14mm first and 13mm second. Plastic type D stretched 20mm both times. To improve this lab they could have made one more trial & averaged the 3 results. They could also specify on the weights they were using to make the results more interesting.
(a) Based on the students data, I can conclude that plastic type A stretched the least. It is the strongest of the four, because it only stretched an average of 11mm (averaged from the two trials), while B's average stretch was 22.5mm C's average stretch was 13.5, and C's average was 20mm. (b). They should have specified the amount of weight. They should have specified the size and shape of the plastic.
a. Plastic type B stretched the most with 22-23 mm, and plastic type A stretched the least with 10-12 mm. ^p b. Two ways they could have improved the experimental design is by having all of the plastics being the same length in the beginning and adding a certain amount of weights not just saying ''add weights''.
The student could of improved their experiment by leting it stretched a little longer or add another clamp to the plastic sample.
A) I can conclude that this experiment was not valid. This student only had two trials instead of three. ^p B) This prolect could have been valid if the student had three trials and if they had kept their controlled group constant.
a) Plastic type B stretched the most because it stretched an average of 22.5 mm. Plastic type A streached the least because it streached an average of 11mm. Plastic type C and D are in the midle. ^P b) Add weights to the clamp before they put it on the plastic. Specify exactly where the clamp should be placed on the plastic.
(A) A conclusion based on the student's data is plastic type A produced the most amount of stretching from trial 1 to trial 2 (10mm to 12mm) compared to all the other plastic types. However, plastic type D remain the same and on one of the plastuc types C, the amount it stretched decrease from 14 to 13. ^p (B) Two ways the student could have improved the experimental design of the result are instead of using one type of plastic, they should have used various types to broad the results. Also the student could have done more trials.
a) Based on the students data, I conclude that plastic type A was the least stretched out and that plastic type B was the most. ^p b) Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and/or validity of the results is by one, keeping the amount of weight added to each type of plastic constant and two, making sure that the weight of the clamp was subtracted.
Plastic type A was the only type of plastic that stretched the most. The student could of improved the experiment design by having two measuring devices. Also, they could of used heavier weights.
The students could have impared the experiment by doing the amount many times to check if it was accurate.
A . A conclusion based on the students data is that the stronger the plastic that they use is the harder it is to stretch . For example sample A and C must be thicker because it stretched less. ^p B, Two ways the students could have improved the experiment was by actually putting the same amount of weight on each and by saying the names.
Polymer B is the most stretchable plastic. ^p The improve the experiment, the student could have massed the weight used in step 4 to use the same amount of weight to the plastics in the second trial than the first trial.
Based on the students data results, plastic type D stretched the most. Plastic type A stretched the least. Two ways the students could have improved the experimental design and validity of the results are that they should of measured how long each piece of plastic was before they added the weights so they can know how much the plastic stretched. Also they should of used the same amount of weights.
a) According to my results plastic type B had the greatest amount stretched with 22mm in trial one and in trial 2 with 23mm. I would rely on plastic type B to hold my things. ^p B) 1-st way the student's could have made theire results validity better one instead of putting plastic type A B C D they should have labeled them by what plastic they were. 2-nd the students should have seen how far the plastic could stretch before breaking.
a) In conclusion plastic type B had stretched the most in both trial one and trial two. Plastic type A had stretched the least amount in both trials. ^p b) The students could have added how many weights they put on the plastic, and how much each weight weighed. They should have added how long the plastic was before it was stretched.
Conclusively  plastic type B tested to stretch the longest length compared to the other three samples. ^P 1. There is no control in the starting length of the plastics. Different sizes of samples can invalidate the experiments results. ^P 2. The amount of weight attached to the clump should be held constant. Plastic type B, which stretched the longest, could have had more weight on it than the others.
A conclusion on could draw is that plastic type B has the most stretchability. A student could improve the design and results by adding more trials, and specifying how much weight should be added. These two suggestions would durastialy improve the validity of the results as well as improve the design.
a) Based on the data plastic A-C shows a decrease of 1 or 2 (mm) of stretch. Plastic ''D'' is a reasonable plastic to be used as stretchability. ^p There's no need for improvement for the experiment design or results.
Based on the students data plastic type A and B in trial 2 did better than trial 1, but C, D of trial did better than trial 2. One way the student could have improved the experimental design or validity of the results was to measure how can the table was that the weigh were hanging off the plastic with. Another way the could've done better was to test the trial again to see more results.
b) We need material they are plastic, tape clamp it shows that it was the lab of polymer plastics.^p Hypothesis if we attach a clamp to the bottom edge of the plastic sample then1 weights to the clamp and allow them to hang for five minutes and remove the weight measure the length of the plastic because repeat the procedure exactly for the remaining three plastics.
Plastic type B was the most stretchable. It stretched on average 22.5 mm while the others did not stretch past 20 mm. The student could have improved the experiment as design by including the averages and using 3 trials instead of one. Also if one made all the plastics the same length. One could accurately determine which was the most stretchable.
a.) After testing this experiment, the results show that plastic sample D stretched the most (mm), making it the weakest plastic. Plastic type A appeared to have streched the least amount of mm, making it the strongest plastic. b) The students could have made this experiment more valid by adding a controlled group. They could have also done a trial in order to increase the validity of their experiment.
a) We can conclude that plastic B is the most stretchable from all the types, but the lab is not valid because judging by the results the lab was not done the same for each trial.^p b. Two way to improve this lab are: Have s or third trials at least, state the weight of the product used to put on the plastic materia.
"a. One conclusion I have fro this data was that plastic ""D"" was the weakest and stretched the most. ^P b. One way they could have improved this expirement is to make sure all sample sizes are the same length, and making a change if they arent. Another way is by specifiying how much weight to add to the clamp at the bottom of the ample."
3. The second trial(12) is not exactly the same as the first trial(11) cause in the second trial even 1 type plastic goes up but on stays the same. They could of improved the experiment design by make sure every thing is in order, make sure to every type of plastic samples you do the same to it.
A) I have concluded that based on the students data that plastic type stretched the most amount of millimeters and plastic type A stretched the least amount of millimeters. ^P B) Two ways the experimental design could have been improved are that a control should have been added to that experimental off at and include how much weight was added to the clamp.
Plastic type B stretchable most 22mm in T1 & 23mm in T2. Plastic A stretched the least at only 10mm T1 and 12 mm T2. This experiment isn't exactly valid however because stretching the material 2 times usually makes it stretchier the second trial. Hence, the mm stretched in T2 was usually greater for all 4 plastics. Instead, you should have 2 of each plastic to onsure validity. Also, they could have had a trial 3 to see the results came at the same.
China's panda and Australia's koala are two animals that arent predator, pandas eat bamboo and koala's eat eucalyptus leaves. Therefore, they are harmless. They are both different from pythons because pythons are potentialy dangerous considering they can swallow an entire alligator you could conceivably have pythons shacking upto the Potomac
Pandas and koalas are similar because they are both described as specialist animals because they only eat one food exclusively; no change. The panda and koala bears a different from the pythons because because pythons are generalist animals, that migrate and can adapt to the climates in the Lower States, while the panda and koala bears cannot.
Pandas in China and Koalas in Australia are similar because they both only feed on one thing. Pandas eat bamboo and Koalas eucalyptus leaves. Unlike pythons which eat just about everything including Aligators.
Pandas in China only eat bamboo and Koalas in Australia eat exclusively eucalyptus leaves. They are both restricted to one food while pythons eat a varity of foods potentially harming native species.
Pandas in China and koalas from Australia are similar because they are both specialist. They both are different from a python because a python is a generalist.
Panda's are similar to koala's because they are both specialists and a python is a generalist.
Panda's are similar to Koala's by they are both specialist species. They only survive in certain conditions. They are not able to adapt very well and can only eat and live in certain climates. They are both different form pythons by they are not reptiles. Also a python is a generalist specie and can easily adapt to change. They eat a variety of foods, and accept change.
Pandas in china are similar to koalas in Australia because they both are specialist. In the article it states that koala bears & pandas eat mainly one type of food. Koalas eat eucalyptus leaves while pandas eact bamboo. They are both different from pythons because pythons are generalists. And like stated in the article they can adapt to anything.
Pandas and koalas are similar because they eat mainly one type of food for them. Pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. They differ from a python because pythons can eat just about anything...one even attempted an alligator.
Pandas are similar to koalas due to their very much a like eating habitsthey both eat bamboo and occasional bugs. Pythons on the other hand, aren't mammals like pandas & koalas & eat mostly rodents.
A panda from china and a koala from Australia are very simmilar because they are both specialists. Panda's only eat bamboo and koalas exclusively eat eucalyptus leaves.This shows that they are unable to adopt , unlike a python whose habitat in Asia is simmilar to those in about a third of the continental united states.
"Pandas and koalas are similar in that they are both endangered and they eat mostly one thing, ""China's panda, which eats almost nothing but bamboo, or Australia's koala bears which eats almost eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively."" (Achenbach 5). These two are different from pythons because pythons will eat almost any thing."
A China panda eats almost nothing, but bamboo koalas bear eat eucalyptus leaves, those two animals are similar because they both eat a food amount of leaves or something that is green. Those two animals are different from pythons because pythons hurt and wrap their pray around them. Panda's and koala bears stay in rain forests, pythons you will mostly catch them in an hot enviroment.
The pandas in China eat nothing but bamboo and Australia's koala bear eat eucalyptus leaves almost every day. Mammals like a panda and a koala bear, are warm and fuzzy, while animals such as snakes and pythons, are less well respected or supported, which koala bears and pandas are different from pythons.
Panda's and koalas are both similar because they are specialist. They need a very specific climate to live or they will die. Pythons differ from these two animals because pythons are generalist. Pythons have a much broader range that they can survive in.
A panda and a koala beer are similar because they both eat one type of food. A panda eats bamboo, and a Koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves. They are also both specialists, but a python is a generalist. Meaning they can adapt to their surroundings. Pandas and koala beers can't adapt.
"Pandas and koalas are similar because they need special environment and food to live, while pythons don't. To show the relationship between these creatures Mac Innes explains, ""What favors generalists is change. What favors specialists is stability"". In other words, pandas and koalas need stability to thrive, while pythons doesn't."
Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they are their specialist. Pythons are generalists which are the complete offer, to pandas and koalas. The text states ''a generalist is a raccoon, a python, a cockroach, a white-tailed deer. A specialists is China's panda or Australia' koala.'' The specialists are the peaceful creatures that keep to themselves and generalists are the destructive creatures that are harmful and dangerous. This is just like a house cat compared to lion or a dog compared to wolf.
China's panda is similar to Australia's Koala because in the article it states that the panda only eats bamboo and the koala eats eucalyptus leaves constantly. they both only eat one thing and are different from pythons because they eat multiple things (not plants) and are more vicious.
Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they are both specialist species. They both require specific resources and climate to survive. These limits them to only their natural habitats. This makes pandas and koalas much different than pythons. Pythons are generalists and can survive in many different places. That is why pythons are being found naturally in Florida but not koalas or pandas.
Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they both are exclusively eating one food.

Pandas and koalas, eva fogh they live in different of the world are still very alike. The one thing they share the most is their food. They both only practicly eat one thing. For the panda its bamboo and the koala eats eucalyptus leaves both these two animals are very dfferent than a python that has no legs and eats anything.
A panda beer is similar koala to a koala bear because they both only eat one food for the most part. Pandas eat bamboo, while koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. But a python is a more diverse and invasive animal. I eats a broader range of things from smaller reptile to amphibians.
Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they both eat food from nature, for example pandas eat bamboo, and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. The difference between the two koala and panda from a python is the different environments they live in .

"China's panda and Australia's koala bear are both specialists. while pandas eat nothing but bamboos, ""and koala eats eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively,""  phython's a generalist. According to the oraicle  we live in an age that favors generalist rather than specialists; and other generalists are best in and around humans."
Pandas and koalas are similar to each other because they both only eat one type of food, while pythons try to eat anything that moves and fit in their mouth. This means that the koalas and pandas are much more likely to go about alike because of their food sources than the pythons.
In the article it says that both koalas and pandas are specialist species. While pythons are generalist species so pandas and koalas are similar because they eat specific types of food, while pythons will eat almost anything.
Koala's and panda's are both specialists, which means that their is only 1 food that is essential to their diets and can't be found much of anywhere else. While a python is a generalists and can survive in other places because it's food source is not limited.

China's Panda bear eats mostly bamboo and Australia's Koala eats leaves, the show no harm on other hand pythons eats pets and harm humans and cause a threat to America's animals.
Pandas is similar to koalas because pandas eat bamboo and koala eat only eucalyptus leaves an they thought eat meat and python eat meat.
Pandas in China and koalas in Australia are similar because they only eat one thing. Pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus leaves. Pythons on the other are completely different because they have a large variety of what they eat. In 2005, a python swallowed an alligator, and later the python itself blew up.
"Well in China a specialist is a panda who eats almost nothing but bamboo and the Australian koala bear eats eucalyptus leaves all the time. They're both different form pythons because pythons can eat anything and can almost survive anywhere. ""A python swallowed an alligator..."" They'll eat anything but the panda and the koala stick with what they know which is the bamboo and the eucalyptus leaves."

Pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo and koala bear which eats eucalyptus leaves they are similar because they both just eat plants. They both are different from pythons because a python is a reptile and a snake and eats mice and other kinds of animals and you really don't see pandas and koala bears in the street and other weird places.
Pandas and koalas are similar because they only eat about one thing lik pandas eat almost nothing but bamboo and the koalas eats only eucalyptus leaves only. The pyth on eats anything it canget lik on alagator.
China's panda eats almost nothing but bamboo tha is why China's panda and Australia's koala are similar because Australia's koala they eat eucalyptus leaves almost exclusively. and China's panda and Australia's koalas are both different from pythons because pythons don't eat the same.
The pandas and the koalas are similar because they are the same specia and due, are different's because pandas eat bamboo and koalas eat eucalyptus.
Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia because they only rely one one food source for panda's it's bamboo and koalas it's eucalyptus leaves, yet they both are different from pythons because they rely on more than one source to survive, and they keep on moving to different locations.
Chinas pandas and Australia's koala bears are similar because they each only eat one kind of food that it. The phython can eat anything pretty much. Thats how the phython is different from the pandas and koala. The koala eats eucalyptus leaves and pandas eat only bamboo.
The China's panda eats almost nothing but bamboo and the Astrailia koala bear eats eucalyptus almost exclusively.
Pandas in China are similar to koalas in Australia since they are both specialists that eat a certain type of food almost exclusively. They are different from pythons because pythons can live anywhere and are most abundant in or around humans.

The word invasive is significant to this article. The author uses the word invasive to describe animals that have immigrated to a new enviornment. Even the tittle: one man's pets another's invasive species is important in this article.
"The significance of the word invasive is meaning the meaning of the word.

I think the word mean different because there are different type of animals."
"The word ""invasive""  in the article is used in the context of invasive species, eliminating other species and invading the native habitats of other animals. The article discusses the growing amany of invasive python species and the different viewpoints on how to handle it."
The significance of the word ''invasive'' to the rest of the article is that these animals are not invasive, they are being introduced to the U.S. by people like RobRay MacInnes, who import them here to sell on the market.
The word invasive like says in the article mean a animals that passed judgement.
The article focuses on the introduction of the native species of reptiles. These intruders are called invasive species because they tend to conquer or take over the new habitat, forcing out other native species.
"The word invasive is very important to the article and also explains alot about the way the animals act in the area. Without any natural predators the pythons living in the everglades have nothing to kill them to keep their population down. This makes them ""invasive"" because they are taking over a once stable environment."
"I believe in this article ""invasive"" means hidden/unchecked or referred to pythons MaccInnes  uses this word when he states "" I think that invasive  is passing judgement"" he used this because he in happy that pythons are going birth and the number is increasing where others say its ""invasive"" as  in this is not a good thing this is how invasive was used."
"Invasive, meaning a foreign species that has made a home somewhere it isn't native to. For an example, in the article they speaks of how the Nile nonnter lead. can now be found around cape soral. The animal has the word ""Nile"" in its name.. its obviously not a native species to Florida."
The significance of the word invasive is that the python and other reptiles are coming to areas where they don't belong. One man might like the reptile but another man sees that it will backfire on soon harm the habitat. It's living in and expand its population causing that habitat its new habitat where it will now live.
"Invasive means something that invades an area. This is important in the article because the main idea is that pythons are an "" invasive"" species in the Everglades in Florida. without understanding the word invasive, one would not understand the arguements presented by Bob Roy MacInnes or skip show on the positive or negative affects of pythons as invasive species."
"The word ""invasive"" is very appropriate for almost all of the article arguments in both positive and negative ways.

"The significance of ""invasive"" is that there is controversy on whether or not these animals are harmful to society and therefore ""invasive"" or if they are just being introduced to society and they are not doing anything negative."
"The significance of the word ""invasive"" to the rest of the article means strange animals, have a place in our society, our homes, with no question. In paragraph 7, ""Invasive species is unfair."" This means that just because their not our everyday animal doesn't mean you can't form a life for them!"
"The word ""invasive"" means intruding. Invasive species, like the python in the everglades are beginning to threat native species. They are new animals that threat biodiversity. These animals can cause animals to become extinct and are generalist so they can adapt to different environments and affect other people and organism's in and existence."
Invassive as to almost coming right up too. In this article it is used to devicte a species invading and going, were people think it shouldn't be.
"The significance of the word invasive is it can be used as a powerful word. It can also we used to pass judgement on your thoughts and concerns about a topic.

I supose that invasive has a strong meaning behind itself."
The significance of the word invasive is to explain that the animal is invading our home land and people that the animal poses a threat in the article they say that reptiles are invasive species but MacInnes says that government overestimate the threat of these species some are cammercially attractive.
I think that the word invasive is like saying people are not supportive of animals like that because not a lot of people own them and when they an see them there scared because they are not being supportive about them.
"The significance of the word ""Invasive"" is that when people hear it to them it sounds dangerous and leathal but it really doesnt means that.

So what he saying is that just because someone calls them ""Invasive species doesnt mean thare harmful, if kept in controlled environment."
"The word, ""invasive"" plays a very important role in the article. Biologists, such as Skip Snow claim that these reptilian species of pythons and lizards are ""invasive"". This conclusion was reached by their adaptability to multiple environments and disrupting the ecosystems.

"The significance of the word ""invasive"" in this article is an animal put into a habitat not its own.This animal if a generalist species will affect  the habitat badly because it will hurt the ecosystem by killing species that normally another animal would eat.The python is described in this article as invasive because it is not their natural habitat."
"The significance of the word ""Invasive"" is like they were sent here but are not ment to be here. ""Biologists, however, say that invasive species unchecked by natural predators, are major threats to biodiversity."""
The word invasive is significant to the article because in one part of article it is used in a good sense saying that invasive species are giving a broader look at pets put in other parts of the article it is used in a bad sence, stating that the species are taking over too much wit people live in the wild also that the species should stay on their native area.
"The significane of the wod ""invasive"" is truely meaning a endaged species or animal. The articles tittle say that the snake is a  pet to some but nether less a wild reptile to others.

The word invasive is significant because they informs you that these animals are dangerous and shouldn't be kept as pets because they arent used to the area's they are kept. This is why MacInnes says they should say introduced instead because its not as bad.
Invasive means that the species kind of was introduct to an area. The species does not adapt to the new environment.
"The word invasive was used in context saying ""invasive species"", said by McInnes . I think the word would mean to not belong somewhere, but it is a personal opinion the way you feel about it. MacInnes feels it shouldn't be used because they're being ""introduced"", and that it's a ""passing judgement."""
"In this article, the word ""invasive"" means animals that have taken over area, unchecked by natural predators, that are major threats to biodiversity. For example, the article says that the pythons in Florida are imperiling five endangered species. This could lead to an unbalance in the enviroment. Invasive animals could also stretch their habitat to a larger area."
The significance of the word invasive in the article is big due to the fact that this article mainly talks about invasive animals such as snakes, pythons etc. Also it talks about the animals that are not invasive such as the koala and the panda.

"Invasive in this article means an animal that has entered into human territory in the article it says ""trade in nonnative creatures as a factor in the rising number of invasive species such as Burmese Pythons"" showing that pythons are invasive animals."
Invasive in the context of this article means species, such as the Burmese python and the Nile monitor lizard, do not have predators here in the U.S to hunt them. This is very significant because this means their numbers cannot be kept in check and they might overpopulate. Complications will ensue without natural barriers for these species.
"The significance of the word ""invasive""is used quite often in the story and MacInnes thinks it shouldn't be invasive but introducing because invasive is more of a judgement.MacInnes thinks that not every animal invades property of humans but it introduces themselves to new things in the world."
Well, the word invasive is kinda like a bad thing because the word invade is similar to the word invasive so i'm thinking that threat invasive species would invade an area that these kinda species don't belong there.

"The word invasive, in this sense, means invading the homeland of another and taking over.

"Invasive invading researchers find pythons ""invasive"" because they are multiplying and eating endangered species. They're moving to different areas and invading other animals territories."

This is why ""invasive""is significant."
Many invasive species undergo a lay before proliferating. What is certain is that by 2002, pythons were seen in multiple locations in remote regions at the Everglades. With the knowledge of snakes being smaller, not very durable animals that don't move for from where there born, it would say invasive means that the snakes kind of invaded the Everglades which is surprising because they don't get around well.

Overall, the use of the word ""invasive"" is simply used to describe the many differences between these reptiles and other animals."
Invasive in this article is exactly what the snakes are. Their invading Florida wildlife areas such as the Everglades and quickly killing off natural species that inhabit the area. I lived in Florida for a while and this is their favorite word to use about anything not natural that's being brought in. So to this article its significant because it says exactly what the snakes are invasive.
"The word invasive is significant to this article. It is because of this article, there are two sides, one who believes these animals are ""invasive"" and one who feels they are being introduced. They are invasive because they have major threats to biodiversity and what would happen when the natural barriers are removed. On the the other hand for example, RobRoy MacInnes believe these animals are a wonderful introduction."
"Invasive is a repedetive word. We in this article. It simply means intruded or unwellanet. The article refers to reptiles as ""invasive species"", claiming  thing are dangerous. However most believe the word invasive is ""passing judgement"" as said in the article."
Invasive in this article is significant because it explains how non-native species are coming into our country and disrupting the ecosystem.
Invasive species are species that have no predator so the refore the population rises. The articles describes this predators and gives examples such as pythons. It tells the story about a python that ate a crocodile to know how invasive can grow at of control.
The word invasive means that the reptiles can be wild animals at all time. They need to keep on eye on them.
"The word invasive means that the animal or thing is now, it tells about how it can be either good or harmful to allow invasive species into an area. The reason why is because MacInnes explained that pythons are introduced and invasive is just ""passing"" judgement."
Invasive to the article means that other species under go a  lag before proliferating, or (multiplying).
"The significance of the word ""invasive"" to the rest of the article is sort of like invasion of these types of reptiles and how us humans are scared of them so we tried to stay away. In the article it states, "" A snake like that, coming at you you'd leave alone or simply die of fright.""  Bearing that if you see one you must leave it more."
Invasive is described as not being introduced and that it is too harsh of a word to be used in this contest.
Invasive means that a species, not native to the particular area it was introduced to; overpopulares and causes extinction to other species. This is relative to the article because the article talks about how pythons are becoming an invasive species in Florida and even endangered the key Largo wood rat.
Invasive is significant because it implies that reptiles invade your home and are unwanted pests.
The significance of the word invasive is to describe the python in this article. What impliedfrom this word has that the snakes aren't oftenly every place there predators who bill are are carry hurt us.
Invasive is like when there is a lot of one thing everywhere like pythons are becoming invasive because there are becoming so many more of them as time goes on.
The significant of the word invasive refers to an imbalance to the ecosystem. Biodiversity is a growing problem which involves a new species in an  unfamiliar environment. This is a problem as they are not the target of predators and they have many animals to prey on, causing populations to be shiffed. As the new species spread it can cause more problems for existing species.
"The word invasive means ""unnatural"" in the article because the article comparing invasive reptiles to natural reptiles. They are natural unbreeded reptiles."
Invasive means farced. Because there saying how people started banging in species to new places. And macInnes says of being forced there being introduced.
"The significance of the word ""Invasive"" is that this means species are being spread around at a high rate. This article explains the danger of it, including examples of pythons spreading across the U.S. and eating different animals, killing them all."
The significance of the word invasive is to show us the reader that this reptiles are a strong group of reptiles very dangerous than others.
"Invasiveis significant to the rest of this article because it is how more specialist and uncommon animals are classified people say that ""invasive species are major threats to biodiversity"" (Achenbach). This article describes how these invasive animals are making an impact on how life on earth has never moved this fast."
The term invasive means or species of plants or animals that is introduced to or new environment, that thrive and take over. The invasive species invade and aren't imbalance in ecosystems. In the article, invasive is being used to describe the pythons because they are not native to North America, yet they are continuing to multiply and are growing. They are moving northward and hold a potential threats to more northern ecosystem an could cause problems.
"In the article ""invasive refers to a species that come to be invading an area. However, certain people think that the word is to harsh and instead say that they're being ""introduced"". Also, the article states that invasive species are a major threat to biodiversity. This is referring to the pythons in the US. They are quickly changing peoples and other animals habitats. The article states that people think those invasive pythons came and were swept up when a hurricane occurred."
"The word ""invasive"" is significance to the article because it is  the article. The article is based in the idea that some exotic pets like pythons ,may escape in the wild and become an invasive species, causing a threat to the local environment and biodiversity. The article also provides some example 2 invasive specie and their effect as well pythons , alligators in 1992 that earth proliferating spread of pythons within a year."
"The word invasive shows that pythons, rattlesnakes and other reptiles weren't originally and naturally found in the United States. People brought them here, and residents buy them since it's ""a very effective threat display."" These species are foreign and the article explains what will happen if they continue to live in this foreign environment."
The word invasive is significant to the rest of the article because it is describing what animals take over enviroments and adapt easily for example, paragraph 12 states that the pythons went native, in Florida. Just by the fact that pythons are now native in Florida, means that they can adapt fast.
"The significance of ""Invasive"" is passing judgement. In paragraph 9 biologist say ""that invasive species unchecked by nataral predators are major threats to biodiversity."""
The mRNA travels to the ribosomes. At the ribosomes the mRNA is copied so that is can be used to create proteins.The copies mRNA is then used as instructions to create proteins.The proteins are made, using the instructions given.
ATP is created and broken down.It is broken down when 2 phosphate groups don't connect with the third causing ADP.ADP can make ATP again by remaking itself.
The mRNA first gets on an electron transport chain.
The mRNA then travels to the mitochondria, where it is then copied.Then one mRNA goes to the nucleus while the other goes to the ribosomes, where it transfers its infornmation to the organelle. The organelle then reads the infornmation and makes proteins.
First thing the mRNA does is go to the ribosome.  Next, the tRNA comes and decodes the first three nucleotides.  Then, the tRNA brings over the amino acid that matches the codon.  Last, the tRNA shifts over and the amino acids form peptide bonds with one another.
goes to the er then golgi bodys
messenger RNA collect  the protein particals inside the nucleus of the cell the the transport RNA comes by to collect those prteins in that cell and takes them to anothe rcell in the body so that, that part of the body can absorb those protein and use tem in the function of protein sythesis.
Translation- The amino acid code is translatedTranscription- The amino acid code is readSynthesis-The protein is made Introduction- The code is given
1. The mRNA takes the copied information out into the cytoplasm.2. There tRNA brings in nucleotides to pair up with the mRNA inorder to make a copy of the DNA strand.3. An amino acid is then paired up with each set of three nucleotides.4. Once the process is completed it is used to make a protein.
first the mRNA leaves the cell nucleus and moves to the ribosome where tRNA finds complementary bases
The mRNA brings the protein to another place in the cell, via the Golgi Apperatus.An Amino acid forms the protein.The protein begins to form in the smooth endoplasmic reticlium.The protein is refined in the rough endoplasmic reticlium.
mRNA leaves the  nucleus. Then it enters the cytoplam, and proceeds to the ER.
1. The mRNA leaves the nucleus.2. The mRNA transports to the reticulum.3. The mRNA hooks onto a DNA.4. The mRNA is transported by the tRNA back to the nucleus,
anaphase, metaphase, prophase, telophase
Four major steps involved in protein synthesis are as follows, mRNA enters a ribosome. Then, tRNA delivers amino acids to the ribosome. The mRNA codon matches with the tRNA anti-codon. Also, the amino acids are joined by a condensation reaction. This process is repeated until a stop code is reached.
1.The mRNA sends a message to ribosomes to send anticodons.2. The anticodons place themselves on the matching portion of the mRNA strand.3. The ribosomes begin to create proteins.4. The opposite RNA strand of the original mRNA is created.
Prophase, Metaphase, Anaphase, Telophase
It sends instructions for the amino acid sequence if a protein.
The mRNA trvales through the cytoplasm, then enters the ribosome, then the ribosome decodes the amino acids, and then the mRNA leaves the ribosome and the ribosome makes more of that codon.

Protein synthesis is needed in your body because of the proteins. The four major steps are when it occurs in the body and when your body uses the protien.
Once mRNA leaves the nucleus, it travels to the other cells in which the protein is started to be made. By the end of the mRNAs journey, protein is formed.
the dna then begins to reproduce,  then mitosis takes place, then the off spring is present.
The mRNA exits the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm of the cell.Ribisome produce proteins according to the directions on the mRNA.The produced proteins are arranged in the order described by the RNA.They proteins go through the rough endoplasmic reticulum for further modification.
When the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it fits through the holes by virtue of being single-stranded. The mRNA floats around until it encounters a ribosome. The ribosome latches on to the mRNA with the larger portion nesting with and reading three nitrogenous bases, called a codon, at a time. The ribosome says in semi-stasis until a tRNA with the proper corresponding nitrogenous bases bumps into it. The tRNA is held by the ribosome until the second codon has been read, and a second tRNA is bonded to by the Ribosome. A peptide (dehydration synthesis) bond forms between the two amino acids, and the initial tRNA is 'cut loose' The ribosome then moves on down the mRNA creating the protein coded for. A strand of mRNA can be translated several times.
1. mitosis2. meiosis3. dna extraction4. blood transfer
1) mRNA leaves the nucleus on a DNA strand.2) Ribosomes produce proteins.3) Ribosomes then carry the proteins to the Rough Endoplasmic Reticulum.4) There the proteins are synthesized.
Once the mRNA leaves the nucleus it has to make another kind of RNA to transfer the information to the other parts of the cells and the body. The codons of the messenger RNA are matched up with their codons for a transfer RNA. The transfer RNA is made and can then continue to do its job while more transfer RNAs are being copied. Then the Rnas can go to the ribosomes and give them the message to make more proteins.
1. The mRNA attaches to a ribosome, to begin protein synthesis.2. The correct amino acid attaches to the first part of the MRNA in the P-site, while in the A-site another amino acid waits.3. The ribosome keeps moving intil a stop codon is reached and stops.
The mRNA leaves the cell Cell makes protienmRNA bings it back Cell uses it.
1. mRNA will leave the nucleus.2. It will find a chromosome then attach to it.3. It will then go through codons before adding on to it.4.
The first major step involved in protein synthesis is mRNA leaving the nucleus. When the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it takes the amino acid sequence back to the protein which then results in the second major step which is passive transport. Passive transport brings proteins in and out of the cell. The third step is the when the mitocondria is making its way to help out the other cells with the protein synthesis. The last step is when the protein is making its way back to where is suppost to go, resulting in protein synthesis.
Cells are know to use many things in cell mvment such as mRNA. They also use tRNA,nRNA.
There four major steps of protien synthesis. The first is the mRNA going to the rRNA. Then the rRNA takes the information from the mRNA to the tRNA. Next the tRNA will take the information it has and translate it. Lastly, the tRNA will take the information and make a protein.
mRNA tell instructions to the messenger tRNA makes proteins and oxygen and hydrogen
1. mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosomes.2. Once in the ribosomes, the mRNA gets turned into tRNA.3. The tRNA is gathered by the ribosomes to see what the amino acid sequence is.4. The right things are given to the cell to make proteins.
The mRNA is copied and the coped strand is taken to the
First starting at the mRNA it goes to tRNA, which transfers it to rRNA and then gRNA
mRNA leaves the nuleus and carries instructions for amino acid sequence of a protien to the ribosomes where it helps code the amino acid and makes the protien.
After the mRNA leaves the nucleus it takes the sequence to the cytoplasm. Then the rRNA transports it to to the tRNA.  Then the tRNA takes it to the opposite sequence of DNA, where the process is completed.

The mRNA will arrive at the ribosome with a message to make proteins. The proteins will begin to duplicate its chromosomes. Then the outer membrane will reform and it will have made two new proteins. Then tRNA will transfer the newly split proteins to wherever they are needed.
it moves to tRNA. then it moves to transcription
MutationDiversionmRNADuplication
mRNA travels to give amino acids to tRNA which then transfers the information to a ribosome where it is then turned into a protien and last the protien is joined with others to make a strand of DNA.
prophase metaphase anaphase telephase
First, a strand of mRNA leaves the nucleus out into the cell. Once outside, the mRNA arrives at the Ribosome. tRNA then arrives with an amino acid containing a nucleotide sequence called a codon. These codons are sequenced, and once the end of the sequence is reached, the protein synthesis ends until a new protein is needed.

When the mRNA leaves the nucleaus it is sent to the ribosomes, which start producing the DNA. Next the DNA is 'unzipped' and the genes are replicated. Once this process is done, the DNA is produced.
1. The mRNA gets the information.2. Then it takes it to the tRNA3. Then the tRNA transfers the mRNA.
1. You have to have a code to find the codon2. You have to use the condon to find where you start at3. THen after you get the codon where you start it should be making a code with A,U,G,C,T4. After you find where you stop at you should figure out what it says.

After the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it takes the information needed to make a protein to the ribosome. After that the ribosme reads the mRNA code. Then the complimentary tRNA, with its specific amino acid comes in and attatches itself with the mRNA strand. Peptide bonds are put inbetween the amino acids and it folds up in a certain way to make a protein.

The mRNA sends the genetic code to tRNA. Then, the tRNA takes the genetic code to the ribosomes. The ribosome receives the genetic information and gets help from another mRNA. The ribosome, with the help of mRNA, uses the information to construct the protein that was coded for in the genetic information.
mRNA leads to tRNA and rRNA and then the final step which is either translocation or translation.
The mRNA travels to through the cytoplasm to the midocondrion, and it copies itself to tRNA. The tRNA goes and copies itself to the rRNA and it sends the instructions to ribosomes and the midocondrion. These instructions make the protiens.
One step is metaphase.Some others are prophase,antiphase, and interphase.

THE 4 STEPS ARE TO FIRST GET THE NUTRIENTS OUT. THEN SECONDLY GET THE PROTIEN OUT OF IT. THEN START TO MOVE IT THREW THE CELL. THEN GET RID OF IT.
Transcription- the mRNA strand is changed to the new lettering sequence.Translation- the new sequence is decoded and used to find the amino acid.
goes to the golgi apparatus, then the endo plasmic ritculam, and then leaves the nucleus.
-The mRNA leaves the cell and heads toward a ribosome.  -It enters the ribosome and the ribosome brings the correct amino acids.-The amino acids are place in their correct posistion on the forming protein.-The protein is formed and sent out to do its specified job.
Four major steps are the mRNA is taked from the necleus then it is taken where it is needed in the body the body uses it then it is taken away.
mRNA leaves the nucleus and carries instructions for the amino acid sequence of the protein to the ER, then tRNA transports the things to the Golgi where its packaged and distrubuted by rRNA.
THE mRNA LEAVES THE NUCLEUS. IT IS THEN TRANSLATED MEANING IT IS READ. THEN IT IS TRANSCRIPTED SO THAT IT CAN BE USED FOR WHATEVER IT IS NEEDED. THEN IT IS FINALLY TURNED INTO rRNA.
mRNA carries instructions for the amino acid sequence.Translation occurs to the strand of DNA.Transcription occur to the DNA.A RNA strand is coded of the DNA strand.
mRNA leaves the nucleus and the eventually develops into tRNA and rRNA . It then absords and develops proteins.

its sent to the endoplasmic reticulum which sends it to the roughg version then to mitochondria then to ribosomes
DNA Replication- where the information(DNA) is copied identically. tRNA sends information needed to complete protein sythestis. The  amino acids are converted into new codons. The codons pair with their anti codons.
Prophase, anaphase, interphase, and metophase are the four major steps.
Growth, expand, divide, new.
First the mRNA must identify the protein needed for protein synthesis. The mRNA then travels to the mitochondria. The mitochondria will then begin to produce the new protein that is needed. The mRNA will then turn into tRNA after leaving the mitochondria to travel back to the nucleus for gentic purposes.
it goes through the organisms and leads through the process
when mRNA leaves the nucleus it is then coded through transcription and then transfered to another cell to have the blueprint copied and translated through translation
Four major steps that are involved in protien synthesis are fermentation,lactic acid,transfusion,and transduction.
mRNA goes to the ribosome, where it hands tRNA the code for the protein. tRNA then travels a gets the needed code. After that it goes back to the ribosome where it hands of the supplies and gets another code.

the mRNA gives directions to the protiens to tell them which codes.then they start connecting to the right match.they then break off until the stop code. then they make a strand that then becomes protien.
1. mRNA leaves the nucleus2. Then the rRNA helps the proteins break down3. The tRNA transports the proteins to and from cells.4. Cell walls allow the protein inside for use.
mRNA leaves the nucleus; proteins are brought to the golgi body; golgi body sends the proteins to the endoplasmic reticulum; ER synthesises the proteins
When mRNA leaves the nucleus then mRNA will go to a different cell to do reproduction .  Also when it leaves it will go to other cells to do cellular activities, it will go to a different section of the cell and produce enzymes and it will also go to another section of the cell to produce proteins.
carries instructions from the nucleus to the amino acids sequence of a protein
1. The mRNA goes and attaches to a ribosome.2. It will tell it to do something such as move or stay3. It will make another mRNA molecule on that4. It will go back and get another message
anaphase metaphase prophase and telophase
1)mRNA leaves the nucleus2)mRNA gives the instuctions to the tRNA3)tRNA carries the instructions from the nucleus for the amino acid4)gRNA gets the instructions and makes the protein
Transcription occurs, then translation takes place. Then transfer RNA decodes, and sends the information to have rRNA take place.
The mRNA enters the ribosome and the tRNA transcibes the instructions. Than rRNA retreive the proteins needed.
the mRNA is cut in to one strand, then the mRNA is copied, then amino acids from to the strand.
First the protein is made, then it forms.  After it forms then it starts to make the protein.  At last it is fully functional.
tRNA- carries instructions from nucleus.gRNA- follows the instructions.rRNA- goes back to the nucleus.
The mRNA goes into the ribosome and transcription occurs. when this occurs, an enzyme

After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it goes into the ribosomes, where it is first used to create tRNA. The ribosome then uses this tRNA to 'fetch' the appropriate amino acids from the cell as specified by the RNA's sequence. After returning these amino acids to the ribosome, the ribosome pieces together the protein that the RNA specified with the amino acids. Finally, the protein is released and used for whatever it is intended to be used for.
for this process the mRNA switches over                                    now it becomes  tRNA                                                               which carries instuctions from the nucleus to the amino acid sequence of protein
mRNA takes the transcribed code from DNA to find a ribosome. Once the ribosome is found, the tRNA reads the stranscribed code. This is called translation. After the code is read, the ribosomes send off the code to begin making proteins. Now begins the step of protein synthesis.
mRNA(messenger RNA) leaves the nucleus and delivers genetic information to the amino acid sequence in protein. tRNA tranfers the information. The information is transcribed, then rRNA repeats the sequence.
Four ways are leaving to go to rRNA, disolving.
Transcription and translation is what happens.
1.mRNA leaves the nucleus2. It goes through the endoplasmic reticulum.3. It travels through the Golgi body.4. Finally, it gets the correct codon sequences it needs to form.
tRNA- transfer RNA takes the mRNA and puts it where it needs to go. then, some type of RNA tells the cell membrane what to dothen the mRNA is used to duplicate in the cell membrane
Amino takes proteins to get them read. Porteins carry thing to differnt organsthere to help body funtions
it goes to the ribosome and gives the instrutions on how to make the dna.
1. mRNA leaves the nucleus2. mRNA changes into tRNA3.

1. DNA which is the body making its red blood cells.2. RNA which is the body making its white blood cells.3. MNA which is the body making its brain's certain cells.
mRNA leaves the nucleus, carries the codes for the codon, the complementary strands unwind, and you have two strands.
tRNAmRNAgRNA
After leaving the nucleus enter the golgi aparatus, then through the ribosimes, next pass the mitochondria, finaly out the central vacule.
Starting with the mRNA leaving the nucleus, afterwards, the messenger RNA will then go back to the DNA to give the new strand's copied information. The DNA will then copy the information then re create a new strand for the messenger RNA to take back to the nucleus and bring back a new strand of copied information.
When the mRNA leaves the nucleus it then goes into the cytoplasm where it turns into tRNA. The tRNA then has the codon which codes for the amino acid. From the amino acid it then goes through protein synthesis.
The mRNA leaves the nucleaus and then carries the information to the ER where it is turned into tRNA. Then the tRNA transcribes the information so that the ribosomes can make new ones.
1. The first step is when the mRNA releases from the nucleus into the cytoplasm.2. Next the cytoplasm that has the mRNA in it will attach to a ribosome.3. That ribosome will soon make a peptide bond between the first and second amino acid.4. This will continue until it reaches a stop codon.
tRNA, mRNA, rRNA, and gRNA.
1.mRNA delivers the information to the nucleus2.tRNA gives the directions3.The RNA forms protein4.Process starts over
1. After the mRNA leaves the nucleus it brings it to the mitocondria.2. Where the mRNA goes, thats were it matches its end to another end to make itself into a product that will make a protein.3. Making the protein. Once the mRNA finds out what it will make it turns into tRNA and makes the protein, and that protein is sent out into the body.4. Replication. The protein replicates itself to make many more proteins so that they body has everything that it needs.
It carrys a copy of the DNA strand to the ribosomeIt matches up with its partner, releases Amino acids, then stops at a stop codon after the process get there and brakes of making protein.
Once mRNA leaves the nucleus, they send the sequence to move on to the mitochondria where translation takes place. The translation will take the mRNA and change into tRNA. For example, if you have UAU GCU then the new strand in tRNA would be AUA CGA. After this, then the strands will form the amino acids. Then, you got the amino acids needed for energy and protein synthesis.
First, the mRNA leaves the nucleus to go to the DNA. Then it copies one strand of the DNA. Then it makes ribosomes to translate it. The codons get turned into amino acid and ribosomes attatch to groups of 3 amino acids to translate them. After they are done, they release and continue.
The first step is for messanger RNA to leave the nuclues. After it has done this it goes to a tRNA that links to it and copies its opposite protiens. Then the tRNA is linked to by codons wich forms the code for the protiens. Then the newly formed protiens are sent to where they will be needed.
Protein synthesis helps the body to function. It helps to build the body stronger. It makes the body feel refreshed. Protein synthesis is very important to have.
mRNA leaves the nucleus. It finds a ribosome within the cytoplasm to produce the proteins needed. The mRNA is fed through the ribosome, passing off the appropriate information that codes for the necessary amino acids. Then, the ribosome produces the amino acids.
Massenger RNA travels to the cell membrane.Then it travels throught and stops at the cell membrane.Next it travels to meet up with DNA.And it ends up connected to the DNA.
The mRNA is instructed to tell the ribosome to make more proteins.The ribosome makes proteins.Proteins are delivered throughout the body. The are transported on the cell membrane.

1. The mRNA will now travel to the rough endoplasmic reticulum.2. Now it will move into a ribosome.3. Next the mRNA will travel to a vesicle.4. Last it will fuse with the cell membrane so that it can leave the cell.
The nucleus must recieve new information, it must use it, adapt to it, and then produce it.
mRNA picks up a codon and takes it back to the protein.mRNA finds the codon that matches with its own.mRNA connect the two codons.The amino acid is formed.
mRNA tells the oraganelles what to do to help the cell with reproducing. It would involve replicating and dividing the cell to become two cells.
DNA,RNA, TRANSLAION, tRNA,PROTEIN,
the RNA links with ribosomestRNA looks for anti-codons to links with mRNAprotein link the tRNA and mRNA togethera new strand of RNA is created and breaks off the protein
it then goes to the golgi apparatus
The mRNA is the messenger so it sends the message to other parts of the cell. Then transcription occurs, then tRNA occurs and this is where it carries instructions from the nucleus to the amino acid sequence of a protein.
Four major steps that are involved in protein syntensis are;-mRNA leaves the nucleus-The mRNA moves through the cell and buddys up with tRNA -the tRNA is now transferred to the plasma membrane-the plasma membrane makes proteins.
Metaphase- the proteins meet in the middleAnaphase- the proteins multipluTelophase- the cells begin to seperateCytokineses- the cell begins to start the process again
mRNA leaves the nucleus the body starts another cycle another mRNA is produced mRNA leaves the cell
After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it pairs up with another strand comtaining the opposite nucleotides. This DNA strand, considered tRNA then attaches to a protein to code for an amino acid. The amino acid stays attached to the protein.
tRNA receive the messager mRNA. tRNA then start producing protein and then goes thought gRNA.The protein then goes though sythesis.Which then is creates protein synthesis.
1. mRNA leaves the nucleus2.mRNA starts to retrieve new proteins.3.mRNA puts new proteins together4.mRNA put the new strand of RNA together and sends the protein out to where it's needed.
The mRNA changes into tRNA or gRNA or it will change into rRNA.  Transfer RNA helps transfer things, etc
four major steps
mRNA leaves the nucleus but is transported to the mitochondria.The mitochondria has tRNA send a messages to the nucleus. Once the message is received the rRNA performs the function.Then it repeats starting back with the mRNA.
When mRNA leaves the nuclues, it is taken to the cyltoplaism. from there, tRNA reads codons or 3 bases at a time. After reading the codons, it gets the right amino acids. The amino acids then make the right proteins.
mRNA is the messengertRNA transports the RNArRNA relicates the RNAprotien synthesis is the product after the process
Transcription- The mRNA leaves the nucleus, goes into the cytoplasm and finds the ribosomes.Initiation- Part of the mRNA fuses with the ribosomes, telling the ribosomes to begin prtein synthesis.Elongation- The ribosomes forms the proteins. It eventually gets made into peptide chains and during this step the proteins add on to the peptide chain making it grow.Termination- The mRNA tells the ribosome to stop, and the protein synthesis cycle is ended.
We get more healthy, no deaths, more nutrients, no diseases
Four major steps involved in protein synthesis are recreation, bounding, healing, and protecting.
Mutation- making another cell just alike Replication- copying cellsCrossing over- exiting the cell to enter another cellImbedding- entering a new cell
The mrna turns in to rna which is the transfered to the nucleus. From there the rna turns in to dna as we know it.
It leaves and it creates more mRNA's and that helps your body. And then it repeats the process again. And it sends messages to the nucleus.
The mRNA brings the codes to the organelles that produce protein. It drops off the codes and the Proteins are made. The tRNA leaves and goes to the nucleus to copy the codes again through transcription.
Protein synthesis has four major steps which are the mRNA leaves the nucleus then makes the protein into a smaller strand and the tRNA takes it to where the RNA is and passes it off to the RNA, then the RNA takes the protein to where they can read it.
The mRNA is sending a message for the protein to be produced, then the protein is carried off by the tRNA to other organelles, th the protein is synthesized, and finally the protein is made usable for the body.
After the mRNA leave the nucleus it goes off into the cytoplasm and proteins connect to the mRNA strand. After this happens they convert the mRNA to amino acids and it goes down the strand one by one till it reaches the stop codon. After this point it gets copied into a rRNA strand. Lastly it then gets carried to other places in the body that need to know the RNA combinations so they can make DNA in the next cell with mitosis occurs.
then it gets sorted and it brings RNA back
mRNA leaves the nucleus, and then goes out to find a protein molecule, then it attaches itself to the protein molecule and sucks some protein from it, and then returns to the nucleus.
anaphase, metaphase, telophase, prophase
1.tRNA takes the message to the codons to form a new strand2.The new strand is made by the tRNA getting codes from the DNA3.The codons then are matched up and the new protein is one long strand4.It is then put in a chamber where it is folded to the shape it needs to be in to carry out its function
The mRNA will take the codes for the protein to the tRNA. The tRNA will transfer it to the rRNA which will take it to the ribosomes. The ribosomes finish the process of protein synthesis and when it is done there, one has a new protein!
It then enters the ribosome in which it meets the tRNA and is then creating an even bigger strain of nucleic acid.
After mRNA leaves the nucleus, the nucleus disappears. This stage is also called Prophase. The next step is when the rRNA takes the ribosomes to the golgi bodies to be 'packages' and send throughout the body to help in certain spots. The third stage is when tRNA is placed together to help make more ribosomes.
The mRNA sends the protein to tRNA. tRNA sends the protein to the mitochondria. The mitochondria uses the protein for energy. Our bodies use that energy.
tRNA
It copies the mRNA and makes it tRNA which then it copies and makes another identical strand without using the letter T.
The mRNA goes to the ribosomes then it sends signals up up to the anticodons. It then reads them and sends singnals down to the amino acids the then connect together with peptide bonds and form a protein molelcule.
the knowing of dna, the knowing of the secondary mRna, knowing biology, and knowing what it does.
mRNA,rRNA,gRNa,and tRna
mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosome where an adhesive is placed on it. It then travels to the golgi apparatus where it is added to a corresponding strand of RNA to make DNA. The DNA is used for reproduction.

When mRNA leaves the Nucleus it goes through PMAT1. Prophase2. Metaphase3. Anaphase4. Telephase
The mRNA goes to the ribosome. The tRNA transfers the copyied strip and it goes through amino acids and is copyied.
First the cell starts by separating a piece of DNA that will be used as a template for the protein synthesis.  Then a mRNA will find the corresponding piece to the nucleotide.  Next comes a tRNA which gets the corresponding piece to the nucleotide.  This then carries it to the strand.  Once all the pieces are brought together to form the protein it will be put together by a rRNA.
tRNA links up with a protein.mRNA goes through the protein and gets decoded.rRNA Takes the decoded strand to the golgi aparatus and start the protein synthesis.
The mRNA in the messenger RNA.  It tells things what do to.  Four major steps invloved in protein synthesis are it makes protiens, tells them what to do, tells them where to go, and it controls everything. It is very helpful to protein synthesis.
The first step involved with protien synthesis is activation. mRNA must activate the hormone that starts replication. The second step is the hormone Helicase dividing the two strands of DNA to be read. The third step is replication. DNA Polymerase replicates the DNA by matching the codons with the anti-codon, making RNA. The forth and final step is 're-zipping' the DNA strand into one, uninteruppted strand.
transcription-mRNA is transcribed into tRNAtranslation-the tRNA is then translated into what protien the cell needs to makethen the tRNA is used to help make the new protienthe protien is now made and the cell can use it for it's benefit
mRNA leaves the nucleus and goes to the ribosome, which is where the proteins are made, picks them up, and brings them back to the nucleus.
The golgi body sends out the dna the mitrocondria is the power house?

Protein synthesis involves for major steps.  Sunlight is needed. Sugar is needed. Carbon dioxide is needed. But energy is needed as well.  Protein synthesis is a very complicated process.
The mRNA leaves the nucleus to transfer a message to the tRNA. The tRNA transfers all the protiens into there new form. Then telophase changes them back and gives them each a condon. Finally the Dna is complete.
1. The mRNA leaves the nucleus with the codon information.2. It takes it to the ribosome to make an anti-codon3. The anti-codon heads back to the nucleus to take the protien and amino acid that the dna needs.4. The tRNA anticodon conects with the codon

Protein synthesis involves; mRNA which sends messages, and tRNA which is transfer RNA.
The mRNA acts as a template to make give to the translation rna and the tRNA moves to the ribosomes, attaches to a corresponding sequence, and then the proteins are made in the ribosome.
The mRNA leaves, and transfers into tRNA (because mRNA is the messenger RNA). the tRNA holds the information.

mRNA leave the nucleus. The mRNA find its start codon.It puts in its matching letter (the message its carrying) through the enzymes that surround it.Then, it puts it into codons (sets of 3) and codes for the amino acid, creating a polypeptide chain, or protein.
The mRNA comes out of the cell and to protein. Then changes the RNA strand to an mRNA strand and makes proteins from there.
1. The mRNA enters into the DNA, and creates a copy of it.2. Then the mRNA gives off information to the tRNA. 3.
mRNA to rRNA to tRNA
DNA TRANSLATES INTO THE RNA
After the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it goes through the cytoplasm and hooks onto a ribosome. At the ribosome, the tRNA comes and matchs the codons with anti-codons. When the anti-codons have been set on the codons the tRNA then brings over the amino acids that match the codons or anti-codons. They are then held together by a peptide bond.
When the mRNA leaves the nucleus it finds a portion of DNA, and uses an enzyme to 'unzip it'. The mRNA then copies the bases of the DNA to form a new strand of RNA. When the new RNA is made its nucleotides code for amino acids, so it attaches to an codon which makes the amino acids, which form protiens.
After the mRNA leaves the nucleus, tRNA translates the coded message the mRNA has been carrying, then proceding to give the rRNA the instructions, and thus the end result is the ribosomalRNA completes protein synthesis and the process starts over again.
replicate its dna and then ship it away to be replicated in a different way creating rna
The cell takes in oxygen, then it takes in water, it moves across the cell membrane to get protein that it needs to continue the growth process.
In mRNA there are four major steps and they are messanger whih is mRNA,transfer which is tRNA,rRNA, and gRNA.

The tRNA isalredy caryyimg the matching anticodons and then it attaches to the amino acids. 3.The trna travels to the site odf protein synthesis which would be the ribosomes.4. Once at the ribosome the trna finds its matching sstrand and then binds with it.This then produces protein
The steps are: The enzymes leave, the nucleus gets smaller, the rybosomes get rid of waist, and the rybonuclaic acid eats away the nucleus.
GUANINE, THYMINE, ADICINE JADINE
The four major parts of Protein Synthesis are rRNA, tRNA, mRNA, gRNA. The mRNA carries instructions from the necleous for the amino acid sequence of a protein. All these steps put together allows protein synthesis to occur.

mRNAtRNAgRNArRNA
From mRNa it travels to tRNA which carries them to the amino acids and then to the ribosomes which make proteins.
YOU COULD NOT LIVE WITH OUT IT
Then mRNA travels to where the amino acid sequences are being made. Then it is coped using tRNA and made into a serparate strand using rRNA.
When mRNA leaves the nucleus it enters the cytoplasm which attaches to the Amino Acid chain, which goes to the ribosomes and make  proteins(Amino Acids).
The mRNA carries instructions to the ribosome where synthesis will take place. Then tRNA takes the synthesised protein from the ribosome to the rRNA who is the message and finishes the process.
Interphase, telophase, anaphase, and prophase.
AnaphaseMetaphaseProphaseInterphase
It leaves the nucleus and goes and attacts to cells and then it starts to multiply once it multiplies it involves protein synthesis.
The next step after the mRNA is the tRNA and that is the transer DNA. That holds the message that the DNA gave the mRNA. After that is when the membrane get the information. After that is when the body responds to that.
-mRNA leaves the Nucleus-mRNA travels to the Endoplasmic reticulum

(1) The messenger RNA sends information to the transfer RNA. (2) The transfer RNA relays the information to the Ribosomal RNA. (3) The Ribosomal RNA attaches to other RNA. (4)  An enzyme activates the manufacture of protiens between the RNA molecules in the Nucleolus.
AnaphaseTelephaseMetaphaseProphase
One: getting energy to the nucleus to do this action.Two: getting the mRNA to the cell membrane to preform this action.Three: turn the energy into protein for the cell and bodyFour: repeat it again.
After leaving the nucleus, the RNA is copied. The bases for RNA are adenine, uracil, cytonine, and guanine. Then the bases are read as a codon. The codons are attached by amino acids. Finally, the new RNA strand is taken to the ribosomes to make proteins.
The mRNA gets transfered into tRNA the tRNA goes  and tell them what kind of protein to make and then the DNA splits
mRNA must travel to the ribosomes.Then it must turn information into a readable secquence so that the T cells can read it.
The first big step in protein synthesis is the mRNA leaving the nuclues through nuclear pores. The second big step is finding a ribsome to decode the mRNA. Next, tRNA moves in and adds the anti-codon to start making a protein. The anti-codons are joined by amino acids. To finish the process, a tRNA leaves and the ribosome moves down the mRNA to the next codon. A new tRNA brings a new anti-codon.
RNA stand for ribo nucleicacid.DNA stand for dioxiribo nucleicacid.

as it leaves the nucleaus it travels to the mitocondria then to the golgi apparaus and to the cell membrane divides.
Once the mRNA leaves the nucleus it go to the ribosomes where protein will be made. Then the protein will make its way to the mitochondria where it will be transfered into energy the cell can use.
1. The mRNA leaves the nucleus2. The mRNA travels through the cell3. The mRNA reaches its destination4. The process starts all over again.
When the mRNA leaves the nucleous, it is taking a copy of the DNA to make more copies and create a protein. As it leaves, it goes into the ribosome where the protein synthesis and copying of the DNA actually happens. In the ribosome, amino acids with the corresponding letters match up to the new copy of the DNA. Stop codons are added to the end and a protein is now made.
Four major steps in protien synthesis are the chains such as the electron tranport chain. The protiens copy themselves and create amino acids. The chain will continue to make as many amino acids as necessary until it reaches the stop codon. mRNA is the type of RNA that sends a message from the nucleus to the RNA strand so it has directions of what and how to make protiens.
After the mRNA leave the nucleus, there are four other major steps involved in protein synthesis. First, a tRNA attaches to the strand of mRNA. The first codon of nucleotide bases on the mRNA match the codon on the tRNA. The tRNA codes for an amino acid. Next, another tRNA connects to the next codon, bringing in another amino acid. The first tRNA floats away, leaving the amino acid behind. The amino acids bond. This continues, creating a strand of amino acids, until a stop codon is reached. Then the chain of amino acids is released.
RNA-DNA- Protein-trait
copying dna, dividing, exiting the cell, finding a new cell
The mRNA takes the protein synthesis and sends it where its suppose to go.
mRNA is very important because it tells about the cells in your body.
rna
mRNA leaves the nucleus and heads over to the protein. The proteins then connect to thier matches. The mRna carries dna infromation to the ribosome. Then there is a PROTEIN.
the nuclius,the memebrans and organells
Step one is replication.
The mRNA then travels to a ribosome and attaches to it. One of end of the mRNA goes into the ribosome and tRNA attaches the corresponding nucleotides to the end. Once the mRNA has been coded the corresponding RNA is then copied again to get the correct sequence. The newly made protein is then released from the ribosome.
The mRNA attaches to the DNA strand. The strand then unzips and tRNA attaches to the unziped DNA strand. It then copy's the nucleotide segment. After it's done copying the nucleotides it goes back to the endoplasmic reticulm and proteins are then made there.

mRNA finds tRNA and it decodes the mRNA then tRNA goes to rRNA and makes ribosomes.
1. mRNA leaves the nucleus.2. It then travels throughout the body. 3. disperses  into your bodys systems. 4. Gets proteins to the body.
Once the mRNA leaves the nucleus it has begins to go through transcription that occurs in the cytoplasm. In transcription parts of the protein will be broken into chains so it cna be matched up later. After, it will go through translation where the mRNA is translated into a polypeptide.The mRNA will match up with one of the single stranded RNA to make a new string of DNA.
The four major steps involved in protein synthesis are: 1. Metaphase 2. Anaphase3. Prophase4. Telophase
The mRNA is the messanger RNA. There are three different types of RNA. MRNA, which is messanger RNA. TRNA which is transfer RNA. And rRNA which creates ribosomes.
mRNA passes the nucleus to DNA and DNA makes it reproduce.
Step 1: They travel through the body.Step 2: They enter the spot they need to be. Step 3:They get to the spot they need to be. Step 4:They do the job.
There is regular RNA, mRNA, tRNA, and protein synthesis. You just make the letters go to their opposites.
The mRNA goes to the ribsosomes.The Ribsosomes make a templet.tRNA finds the parts to make the protiensmRNA goes with the ribsosomes to make the protiens
mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosomes and tells them to make proteins, the ribosomes then start to create the proteins, which are then transfered to the nucleus to be programmed for whatever they are needed for.
mRNA leaves the nucleus, it then has to reproduce, it splits to make a copy, and then the mRNA has to synthesis further to make protein synthesis complete.
The mRNA leaving the nucleus creates a structure for the proteins to leave the cell. Then the proteins leave the cell. After this the cell works to make new proteins. Then the process keeps repeating.
1) The mRNA will take the genetic code to a ribosome.2) tRNA comes to the ribosome and matches it`s codon with the respective codons of the mRNA, dropping one molecule of amino acid as it goes3) The amino acid collects, forming a long string of amino acid4) The ribosome takes in the amino acid and creates protein
it goes threw all the cell parts before being defined
The mRNA strand photosynthesises into a suitbale living condition for the body. Copies itself to make a new strand. After it copies itself it removes bad parts of the strand and fills back up witht the copies.Then, repeats the process.
tRNA-transcribe mRNA into DNAgRNA- gather informationrRNA-mRNA-carries insruction to the amino acid of a protein
first, the mRNA is told what to do and gets the code from tRNA and attends to it.Second, the tRNA brings anticodons to the mRNA. Third, the process is slowed down and anticodons are brought to the mRNA. Fourth, the translation occurs and amino acids are linked together to form a new copy.
The mRNA sends a message to the nucleus, the nucleus tells the cell to make proteins, proteins are made, it repeats these steps.
Protein synthesis has four steps that involve the mRNA going from the nucleus to the ribosome, and then going from the ribosome to the cell membrane and then to the cytoplasm.
Interfase is the longest phase in the cycle. After interfase is prophase which is the first stade of meiosis. The second stage is anaphase which the nucleus splits in two. The last stage is metaphase. Then you have a new cell.
First, mRNA goes to the lysosomes.Second, it copies into tRNA.Third, the tRNA gets codons.Finally, the codons form proteins.
1. It leaves the nucleus then it go's to where it needs to go2. Then it seperates and makes brand new strands of what is needed3. It mutiplies really fast and then makes more and more of what is needed4. Everthing that is needed is now made
mRNA,is the messanger which leaves the nucleus. tRNA ,transfer information to the ribosome.
telephase.metaphase.anaphase.
The mRNA delivers a code to the mitochondria. Then it translates the code into amino acids. The amino acids are then put into specific codes based on what the mRNA said.
First the endoplasmic reticulum takes the protein and breaks it down.  Secondly the ribezomes compress what is left down.  Then the Golgi apparatus takes it to the cell membrane.   The cell membrane then takes it out of the cell.
gathering, protein needs to breath, so it needs more room
mRNA leaves the nucleus, then it is copied into rRNA and tRNA carrying an amino acid attatch to the nucleic acid in segments of three. The tRNA attatches to certain nucliotide sequences that code for the protein attatched to it and then body form between the amino acids as more tRNA come and once the bond forms between the amino acid the tRNA is let go. By the end of the RNA chain a long string of amino acids has been created
Protein synthesis cellular resperation
mRNA leaves the nucleus.it makes a copy of itself.the copy then makes protein.and transcription occurs.

It changes with partners to keep the chin going.It attaches with a dna.It sends messages to the other other stuff.
Anaphase Prophase Interphase Metaphase
1. mRNA leaves the cell, it tells the enzyems which DNA strand to work on.2. An enzyme attaches to the DNA strand3. The enzyme strats to decode the DNA strand into complumentary RNA4. The enzyme detaches and moves on.
after the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it is taken to the ribosome by tRNA and it is made into proteins
1. The mRna tells the Trna to get ready at the ribosome2. The Trna goes and attaches the pairs together3. They keep attaching until it hits stop codon4. The protein is released
Step one: It finds a ribosome and is copied.Step two: It leaves the ribosome and goes to the nucleous.Step three: i dont know
the mRNA goes to the ribosome and gives the potien codes to the ribosomal RNA
1. The mRNA leaves the nucleus.2. The genetic material is transcribed into RNA form3. The genetic material is taken to the ribosomes.4. Protein synthesis occurs.
it leaves goes to deliver information.Goes to the rRNA and it reades the information.Then it makes a copy.and that copy goes out and finds matches to go with.
mRNA leaves the nucleus.tRNA starts.gRNA starts.rRNA starts. ?
The mRNA leaves the nuclear membrane.DNA copies itself.The old DNA dies
The mRNA that was copied from the DNA leaves the nucleus. It goes to the ribosome, where it is transcripted. Each codon codes for an amino acid. The proteins are linked together as they are translated.
cell, tissue, organ, organ system.
The mRNA leaves the nucleus transporting information. Then the mRNA travels to the cells membrane. Then the mRNA drops off the information, then goes back to the nucleus.
The mRNA is copied.
It has to makes it past all the intruders, it leaves the area it began, it mutates, it forms new cells.
it needs to abtain more proein
The mRNA leaves the nucleus with the transcribed DNA, which forms RNA, and takes it to the rRNA which is the ribosomal RNA. The rRNA takes it to tRNA to be read. tRNA stands for transfer RNA. tRNA reads and changes the codons to amino acids.
it goes to same place
making protein
Protein synthesis consists of the building of amino acids. Then they link together forming a chain.Next the chains attach together.Lastly, they turn into the new RNA.
Well you have the stop codon, then... I dont know the rest
it sends a message t othe cell that needs the protein then it sends it back to the brain to get that protein
The mRNA is carried off into different parts in the whole protein synthesis by going down to where it will get carried off to make protein.  Then is will be taken to where it can get energy.  After that it goes through a different phase and and the end it is carried to the end that makes protein.
There are four major steps involved in protein synthesis. One of them is replication. The mRNA cells must replicate in order to leave the cell. Next they must copy other cells. After that, they must duplicate. Lastly they will zip back together to make more copies.
The mRNA leaves the cell and goes into the cytoplasm of the cell. Then, the codon and anti-codon pairs up. Then the anti-codon is released. Then onece it reaches a stop codon there is a chain of amino acids.
RNA
The first step is leaving the nucleus. This step is important because the mRNA goes through the nuclear pores to go to the cell. The next step is sending the message through the cell.
The mRNA is read by the tRNA.  Then the tRNA must put on a cap and a tail, so that it can move and it can keep the sequence in there.  Then it is read by the protein creating the amino acid.
mRNA instructs the protien
energystores foodprotects the cell and foodhelps it stay alive
In he nucleus, DNA replicates. mRNA comes and takes the DNA into the cytoplam. Strands of DNA sequence- AGTC comes into the amino acid in different strand each time.Nucleotides of AGTC that have a bond with the strands, come and bond together. tRNA transfers it which makes a protein.
mRNA leaves the cell gives it to the tRNA then the tRNA travels and gives it to another cell to be translated and help the body healthy, able to grow, and have the body be able to repair itself.
PROKARYTIOC
The mRNA decodes DNA, then takes the code to the cytoplasm, then takes it to the ribosomes to produce function and then takes it to the tRNA to decode and produce protiens/
Diffusion, mitosis, meiosis, and genetic diffusion
The mRNA goes into the cytoplasm and experiences transcription, which is the pairing of bases according to the mRNA sequence. Then the full strand is split, and both strands go to the ribosomes to be translated. When the mRNA strands arrive there, translation will occur, which means that tRNA will bring amino acids that code for a particular segment of the mRNA, will attach together. A certain number of the amino acids will then code for a proteins.
The mRNA leaves and sends the tRNA to the DNA. The tRNA leaves amino acids in a chain onto the new DNA. The amino acids form together to make enzymes, which form into protein.
1. the mrna arrive to where the sequence will be decoded. 2. the sequence will be decoded3. they will turn into amino acids sequence for protiens4. the amino acids will make protiens
the protein drops the amino acid which conect to the other amino acids to make a chain while the RNA moves over and conects with the Other piece of RNA

1. The DNA unzips2. then it goes throught transription where it copies/3 then it translates 4. then becomes a protien.
They create more cells for the body when the cells get too big they break down into smallar size and keep on growing.
The mRNA first leaves the nucleus and enters into the cytoplasm. Second, each tRNA carries one amino acid to the anticodons. After thi,s the tRNA helps to form polypeptide bonds between the amino acids. The proteins continue to grow and bond until a stop codon is reached.

The protein must be copied by the nucles. Then, it must be taken to each cell. Next, the cell must carry out the function. Finally, the process ends and starts all over again.
The messenger RNA tranfers information in protein synthesis. It also uses the golgi apparatus's information to help it go where it needs to go.
It then goes to the RNA strand and sends the message.Then it leaves there and goes to the tRNA and sends the message, which then the tRNA starts to make amino acids.The amino acids then connect to make a peptide bond.Then it starts over agian.
they help clear out germs.they fight bactera that might harm the body.they help your body get used to the germs.they save your life.
It separtes the protein and copies it.
mRNA leaves the nucleus  by a small opening in the nucleus. Then it goes and finds the DNA strand that is broken the mRNA strand knows were it is going because the brainsent it a message to tell it where the broken DNA strand is. Then it slids into places by slidding in between the two broken strands. After it makes sure that everything is matched up and it joins together to make it a hole strand again.
The mRNA leaves the nucleus. mRNA tells the tRNA how to 'design' the protein.The tRNA to go get the peices and put them in the right places. A protein is created.
The mRNA is replicated then passed through the a hole in the nucleus where it is read and coppied into DNA. After that, the mRNA is then transferred out of the cell trhough the cell membrane.
mRNA takes the message that it needs more proteins and makes sure that it gets to the ribosomes, where the proteins are made. the ribosomes start making proteins and when they are done send the proteins for their final packaging to the Golgi Apparatus. The Golgi polisheses and finishes the synthesis of the proteins and send them out in the cell where the are needed.
When the mRNA leaves the nucleus, there are four major steps involved in protein synthesis. First, the mRNA takes coded instructions to the nuclues. After that, the instructons are used to assemble the amino acids to the ribosomes. This is taken by the tRNA. The rRNA completes the assembly. Finally, the new strains of ribosomes can be used, finishing protein synthesis.
The mRNA makes a copy of the DNA and then brings it to the tRNA, which brings it to the amino acid sequence, making a new protein.
Once it leaves it goes to the next station where it will do it's job to complete protein synthesis. It has four major steps along the way  witch are all very important. They all have very important jobs to do.
its changes the DNA.
The mRNA goes through the nuclear pores and delivers the message. The message is then processed and the cells completes the task.

mRNA begin to duplicate the DNA into an RNA form. This then creates another DNA strand, of course after being checked for errors and mutations. In the end, the DNA connects up again after having to split for duplication.
mRNA carries protiens, it helps produs.
Messenger RNA collects the information it needs to copy DNA, then tRNA changes Thymine to Uracil. Two strands of RNA are made.

the DNA unzips and the mRNA comes in and then the DNA gets a new code, and if there is a mutism in there then that will happen, then the mRNA will unzip and the tRNA will get the code send it to the ribosome and then it will decode the code that the tRNA gave and send it back to the DNA
The mRNA goes to ribosomes that read it.Ribosomes send a message to tRNA.The tRNA take take a amino acid.Connecting them making a codon.
First, the mRNA move through the cytoplasma to the ribosome. Then the tRNA take over by making another side.Then the tRNA take it to the ribosome to get cut by restiction enzymes. Then those peices get turned into pieces of protien.

After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it travels through the cell into the cytoplasm. Then the codon comes and so do the amino acids. Next the mRNA carries the instructions for the new sequence and codes for new DNA.
The mRNA goes through the dividing wall and into the tRNA and into a section of the DNA. IT then goes to the Amino acids and create a protein.
-Translation:  moving out of the nucleus into the other parts of the cell-Fusion:  RNA moves to amino acids-Replication:  copying the sequence to replicate the DNA-Reaches stop codon:  the stop codon stops the sequence from being replicated any further.

The four major steps in protein synthesis  of mRNA is, the proteins transfer and build up into different groups. Another major step would be the loss of  nucleus. A major step would have to be passing the DNA through the cell to the nucleus. The last major step would have to be the organells helping to pass the antibodies to fight infection.
The mRNA leaves the nucleus.  The cells travel to a ribosome to make proteins.  Then, the proteins travel to the mitochondia to make energy.  Then, the cell leaves the mitochondia and makes it way to the amino acids.
The proteins are made, then carried by the ribsome, and then released into the body to make energy
It first goes through mRNA and attaches on the the mRNA and waits for something to come then it drops off and it goes on to another strand of mRNA
mRNA changes in to rRNA and goes out in the rest of the cell
the protein is eaten, usued, digested, and flushed out
mRNA leaves nucleustRna transfers proteins
mRNA leavign the nucleaus, the mRNA attaches to the new protein, then matches up the complemetary codons.
The first major step is to find a Ribsome. Next would be to attach to the Ribsome. After that tRNA goes and gets amino acids. The last major step would be to make a long chain of amino acids and turn that into a protein.
The mRNA must leave the nucleus and travel through the cytoplasm. The mRNA must then converge with the different protein bases. The proteins mix in the the mRNA to create a strand. The protein synthesis is made when the strand reaches the normal DNA.
First, mRNA takes the codes to the ribosome to make the proteins. Then, the rRNA codes for the proteins and makes them. Then the tRNA transfers the proteins back to the nucleus. Finally, the proteins are released into the cytoplasm, and the process begins again.
One step involved in protein synthesis is the tRNA moving ribosomes.  Another step in protein synthesis is rRNA making the proteins.  Another step is using the protein.  Another step is restarting the cycle.

The mRNA leaves the nucleus.The mRNA travels to the ribosome.The ribosome attaches to the mRNA.tRNA attaches codons to the anti-codons on the mRNA.
the mRNA goes to the ribosomes. at the ribosomes the mRNA changes in to tRNA. The tRNA leaves the ribosomes and goes to the golgi apparatus to be changed to protein. the protein then gets sent to all parts of the body.
The mRNA goes out to the ribosome and attaches to tRNA. Then, tRNA transfers the code into a useable code. Next, segments are put together with bonds. Every three sections of the code bond to create an amino acid. These amino acids bonded together create a protein. Then the protein is shipped to other organelles to be fixed and put in a useable form for the cell.
IT THEN GOES TO THE TRNA. THE TRNA THEN TRANSPORTS IT TO THE RRNA. THE RRNA THE DECODES IT FOR THE MRNA.
1. mRNA leaves the neucleus2. mRNA reads the DNA3. the mRNA tells the rRNA4. the rRNA makes the DNA split
The RNA leaves the nucleus and then sends codes to the DNA telling it what its new match will be, switching the A's to U's. T's go with A's G's with C's and visversa except the A will switch to a U instead of a T. This is known as mRNA. Then the mRNA sends codes to the proteins telling what codon it will be.example:DNA: ATGTACCGTATGACTmRNA: UAC-AUG-GCA-UAC-UGA(after RNA happens)Amino acid: Tyr, Met (technically you start with a Met), Ala, Tyr, STOP
1) mRNA GOES TO DNA and get its molecules2) mRNA take DNA to tRNA3) tRNA copies it4) DNA is transfered
The mRNA goes to the ribosomes which then code for codons, then taken to the amino acids sending it back to the nucleus to recreate new strands of DNA.
mRNA splits up and meets with the Nuclaic Acid. Then it is combined with Phosphate to create a protein.
When mRNA leaves the nucleus, a tRNA molecule gets the anti-codon and give's it to a rRNA to make the codon, and then gives it to the ribosomes to produce the protien.
translation, deletion, translocation, transformation
It goes to the ribosome and tRNA carrying a amino acid comes in and if the code matches then the amino acid stays and then this process continues until u get a stop codon. The end result is the making of a proteine
1. The mRNA settles on the endoplasmic reticulum.2. The mRNA finds a match of tRNA.3. The two produce a chain of amino acids.4. The chain of amino acids create a protein.
First the mRNA is sent from the nucleus and sent to the ribosomes. Than it is changed into tRNA. After it is turned into tRNA it is sent to be turned into protein. Than when it is turned into a protein it is sent into the body to do it's job.
mRNA leaves the nucleus and hooks up with another mRNA. Then one of the strands breaks off, and another tRNA strand hooks up with it.
DNA separates and an RNA strand is paired with DNA strandThe RNA is taken to the ribosomeThe RNA is then changed to mRNAThen the mRNA is tranlated into tRNAand then you have a strand of RNA
The mRNA leaves the nucleus.It then is tRNA and is carried to where it will create the new cell.The mRNA is transcribed.The mRNA is now a new strand of RNA.

The mRNA scans the RNA to find out what the complementary proteins are. The tRNA brings the complementary strands. The strands bond. Amino acids are made and go into the organelles. The process repeats.
Telephase, Anaphase, and Metaphase
Four major steps involed in portein synthesis are trascription when the strand od dna gets ripped apart then traslation when things occur in the nucleus.
HYDROGEN BONDS AND DNA SEGMENTS
mRNA has to leave the nucleus, then it transfers information to tRNA. After it does that it makes copies, then lastly sends it back to mRNA.
mRNA then heads to the ribosomes where it is transcribed using the codes to create amino acid strands which are connected. A long enough chain of amino acids create proteins.
It goes to the tRNA and transfers over to it, then it flouts to the protein maker, then it goes in the protein maker, and then it becomes a protein.
It takes the protein over to another organelle. Then the protein gets sent all over the cell. They use it for energy. and then they do it again.
The information on the mRNA is copied.
your body used our proties to make energy,it then uses that energy to make new protiens,     then uses those protiens to create energy,therefore helping you say healthy and have energy
The next step that is involved in protein synthesis would be after the mRNA leaves the nucleus the tRNA sends instructions to the ribosomes in order to create the protein. Which is where the DNA is then unzipped. The codons are then attached with the one strand of DNA. Once this has happend the amino acids then match up with their complementary bases to form the amino acid sequence, in order to form a protein.
In prophase, the nuclear membrane begans to disappear.  Then, in anaphase the chromosomes began to break apart and go to opposite poles.  Then in metaphase they chromosomes are at opposite poles.  Then, the cell begans to break apart into two whole new cells.
When mRNA leaves the nucleus it transfers to tRNA. Then it makes amino acids. Then the amino acids make a peptide bond, Then the cycle repeats.
Four major steps involved in protein synthesis are transfering proteins to the cell membrane, producing enzymes,getting energy from certain foods, and digesting them.
1. translation - the items are moved into a diferent order2. transformation - the items are changed into other sequences3. deletion - a certian pertion is deleted4. substitution - a certian amino acid is traded out for a different      one
The mRNA moves out of the nucleus. It is then moved to the cell membrane. Then it is copied down. Last the information acts like a blueprint as the thing needed is built.
--mRna sends messages out to specific places in the body to obtain materials that are needed for protein synthesis--tRna transfers important information to the nucleus to code for amino acid assembly--rRna begins the proteins needed for ribosomal construction--pRna makes specific proteins and other materials that are needed for protein synthesis.
1.) mRNA is transcribed into tRNA2.) codons form in sections of 3 nucleotides with a 'stop' codon at the end3.) tRNA plugs into the codons and starts making the amino acids4. amino acids form into proteins

first thing you want to do is get the mrna to the trna then from there the trna will transform into a cell, now the cell depends on what the body is in need of.
1. mRNA is transported to the ribosomes2. rRNA matches it with the amino acid that corresponds to form proteins
Once mRNA leaves the nucleus it changes size.
Molecules go to the Goli Apparatus, wich then prepares them, which then
As the mRNA leaves the nuclear pore a rRNA comes and aids the process. The tRNA comes and has complementary codons to make a amino acid. Then another tRNA comes and copies the next segment on the mRNA to makes a different amino acid. This is done with the ribosomal RNA at each segment being copied. After doing this process for awhile it forms a polypeptide or protien.
The tRNA then carries the aminos to the polypeptide chain. After that the enzyme helps bond the chain together. The DNA is formed having the original strand that has the codes for the new strand to be formed. Each DNA strand then has a new and original strand.
The strand is translated into another language that the mRNA understands. The strand is then transcribed, turned into an amino acid, and then becomes part of a sequence of proteins.
1. the mRNA goes out of the nucleus and to the tRNA2. Then the tRNA translates the RNA and creates aminp acids to go along with the RNA.3. They attach together.4. and they start making proteins
The four major steps . The first major step is prophase. The second is changing into tRNA to deliver information. The third is breaking down protein. The fourth and final step is messenger it syntheises.
1. The mRNA leaves the nucleus and enter the cytoplasm.2. mRNA strands bind together in the cytoplasm.3. The mRNA binds with amino acids to for the ribosomes.4. The new ribosome creates proteins as needed by the cell.
First, the mRNA leaves the nucleus. When it enters the cytoplasm, the ribosomes meet up with it and it begins protein synthesis. The tRNA matches up with it, and the amino acids are formed. After the opposite strand is made, they break apart and you have a strand of amino acids.
mRNA- tells ribosomes the amino acid sequence to make the proteinribosomes (rRNA)- assemble the proteintRNA- Transfers the protein to the cellcell membrane- allows protein in the cell
1. mRNA leaves the nucleus2. The mRNA grabs onto a cell and goes throughout the body3. The mRNA goes to the stomach4. The mRNA starts the protein synthesis
Ribosomes- shape the mRNA into a protein decoding what it says to know what the proteins job is. Vesicules- transport the protein to where it needs to be. Membran protein- sends the proteing out side of the cell if it's needed.
mRNAtRNAgRNA
First the mRNA leaves the nucleus. Then an enzyme unzipps the mRNA. The third step is an amino acids line up with the corresponding codons. When it reaches the stop codon the amino acids break off together forming a protein.
prophase, anaphase, metaphase, telophase
When the mRNA leaves the nucleus it leaves somthing behind causing the body to change and act different.Also when it leaves it can cause the body to catch a servere change and effect it.It will cause the body to take more harm than it can handle.Toltal harm to the body and the body has no chance at fighting it off.
DNA to RNA then coded for Amino acids then make Protein
When mRNA leaves the nucleus it goes and tells the cell what DNA sequences to make. Then tRNA takes the message back to the nucleus. At the nucleus the DNA strand is pulled apart and the new DNA sequences are paired up to their matches to make two new strands of DNA.
TRANSLATION
Mrna leave the nucleus going to tRNA. Once at tRNA the instructions brought from mRNA are translated into a language that rRNA can understand and then is taken to the rRNA. Once at the rRNA the instructions go through translation which result in a new protein.

Then it finds another single strand of mRNA with matching codons, after it finds the matching codons then the restrction enzyme cuts off the excess codons of the strands, once that is done both ends of the mRNA strands match each other.
mRNA goes out and finds tRNA and this information gets coded to that. The tRNA grabs amino acids. The amino acids tell wich enzymes. The enzymes make the protein.
CLEANS BACTERIA HELP CELLS AND ALL DNA AND CLEANS
Protien is created on the ribosome.
mRNA leaves the nucleus and goes out into the cell to find a ribosome. Once the ribosome receives information from the nucleus to make a new protein, it beings to unzip. Floating nucleotides in the cytoplasm come in and connect with the RNA that is being created.
First, mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosome and gets attached to it. Next, tRNA comes along and attaches it's anti-codons to the mRNA's codons. Then, an amino acid is created and the tRNA strand leaves and another one is attached to the next three codons. Thus, creation another amino acid and the amino acids are held together in a chain by peptide bonds. The chain that is created is a protein.
1. mRNA leaves nucleus headed toward the ribosome.2. It tranfers into tRNA.3. That attaches to the ribosome.4. There it is changed to rRNA
anaphase, metaphase, prophase, and telophase.
1. mRNA leaves the nucleus2. mRNA travels to the ER3. tRNA gives mRNA information 4. mRNA replicates into an exact clone of the existing DNA
mRNA leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm. When traveling the cytoplasm it connects to a ribosome. The ribosomes reads off the mRNA as a codon(three at a time)each codon coding for a amino acid. tRNA travels along the mRNA and carries anti-codons to connect with the codons. The codons and anti-codons are then connected making a strand of protein.
Step 1: The transcription of mRNA from a DNA geneStep 2: Translation occurs at the ribosomes in the cells cytoplasm.Step 3: Elongation of the peptide begins as various tRNA's reach the next codonStep 4: the protein is synthesised

the mRNA splits in half then leaves the nucles and one half finds the correct thing then the other half one does too
Protein synthesis starts with the mRNA leaving the nucleus, then tRNA transcribing the complimentry strand, and finally rRNA.
After the mRNA leaves the nucleus it travels through the cytoplasm. Then it travels to the mitochondria where it goes through transcription. Then it detatches from the mitochondria and goes through translation.
It brengs the prton to the dna
mRNA attaches to a DNA strand then the DNA strand unzipsthen it attaches to some proteinsand then creates amino acids.
THe protein combines with studd, the protein could die, the protein could reproduce, and the protein could mutate.
mRNA leaves the nucleus, than RNA gets sent to the mitochandria, than protein is sent throughout the body.

1.) Mrna leaves 2.) tna
After mRNA leaves the nucleus, transcription occurs.  mRNA is messenger RNA and carries the message to chromosomes.  When it arrives at the chromosomes the mRNA enters and gives all its information to the chromosomes about how the proteins should be arranged.  The chromosomes then take that information and arrange the proteins accordingly.
mRna leave the nucleus, brings information to the amino acid, amino acid produces protein.
First translation starts. Then the codons are made. Codons are matched up. Finaly RNA starts again.
Once the mRNA leaves the nucleus is goes through the blood stream. While in the blood stream once it gets to the other nucleus it drops off the information from the nucleus it just came from. After all that the mRNA is needed no longer. Then comes the tRNA that will help the other nucleus figure out the message. Then it helps the nucleus decode the new message to where it will make sense to the nucleus. Then the rRNA comes along. The rRNA picks up on the new decoded message. Once the rRNA is done getting the message it takes it. The last step would be to take the code and make another RNA sequence.
First, the mRNA leaves the nucleous.Second, the mRNA travels trough the cytoplasm.Third, It arrives at the amino acid sequence of a protein.Finally, it duplicates.
Step 1: mRNA leaves the nucleus.Step 2: mRNA carries instructions for amino acid sequence.Step 3: mRNA delivers the sequence instructions to codon.Step 4: mRNA goes back to the cell it came from.
1.The mRNA attaches onto a ribosome.2. The ribosome reads the mRNA's code by three letters at a time, three letters strung together are called a codon.3.Each tRNA molecule has one of the many anticodons, the complementary code of a codon, attached to them. Once the rRNA reads a codon, the tRNA with the correct anticodon will attach onto the ribosome.4. The anticodon is put on a string attached to the ribosome that when put together with the other anticodons later to come make a certain protein. The tRNA is released from the ribosome.
1. unzip2.transfer3.copy/translation4. rezip
mRNA leaves, sends message to tRNA to create more proteins, amino acids get the message, and new proteins are created
tRNA, rRNA, gRNA, mRNA.
mRNA-which is the messenger,tRNA-which transfeers all of the information, rRNA-replicates the DNA,gRNA
The mRNA leaves the nucleus and then becomes a tRNA. From there its becomes into gRNA. The last part is where it becomes rRNA and helps the ribosomes, enzymes, and protein.
tRNA.
The mRNA leaves the nucleus and to the ribosome.  There it gives the message to start protein synthesis.  The protein recieves the messages and the ribosome begins to synthesis it.
the mrna then is copied except for the thymine that is changed to uracil. and it moves to the ribosomes and is helped made into a protein then the trna goes to the cell
Nucleotides, ribonucleic, nuclear membrane and nucleoplasm are four major steps involved in the protein synthesis.
1.the cell opens2. RNA comes out3.then the cell releases the glucose4.then the glucose goes back into a different cell.the cell opens and the rna comes out and then the cell releases the glucose out into the cytoplasm and then the glucose goes into a different cell.
first it travels in a long line to ribosomessecond the mrna is ripped in halfthird a new strand is made to connect to the mrnalast it lives happily ever after
it gose to a ribosome, and a tRNA links up with the ribosom/mRNA to make a specific protien, the protien gets attached to another over and over again to from a protien chain.
mRNA, tRNA, gRNA, rRNA
The mRNA first goes to the ER.Then the ER makes the protein.Next the tRNA begins to carry the proteins.Finally the tRNA comes back to the cell.
The mRNA copies the anti codons from the DNA and transports it through the cytoplasm. then it meets up with the tRNA and makes an amino acid.
First, the mRNA leaves the nucleus and goes into the cytoplasm with the amino aid sequence of a protein which was translated from the DNA. Then the tRNA attatches to the mRNA and takes the amino acid sequence and copies it. The tRNA then goes to the ribosome, the organelle where protein synthesis takes place. The tRNA, which contains the amino acid sequence for assembling the proteins, gives its information for protein synthesis to the ribosome. The ribosome then assembles the proteins with the sequence given to it by tRNA.
tRNAmRNA gRNArRNA
The process of protien synthesis invovles four steps, including phase 1,meiosis, phase 2, and mitosis.  This causes many changes within the cell.
the mRNA is taken to the cytoplasmthe tRNA helps to create the new protien
light-independent ractions, light-dependent reactions
tRNA
It stays in the mitochondrion to produce more protein.
After mRNA leaves the nucleus, the mRNA conects to a ribosome to produce the protien the mRNA codes for.  In the ribosome the mRNA is read in the sequence of codons and calls the tRNA to go out into the cytoplasm to get the correct amino acid that is called for in the codon.  The tRNA keeps bringing the needed amino acids which results to the making of a protien chain.  When the protien chain is complete it goes out into the cytoplasm and goes where ever it is needed in the cell or outside of the cell.
The virus, because it will kill you really bad.
mRNA leaves the nucleus to go and be checked for errors. Once the mRNA is in the cytoplasm, protein syntheis follows along the line of nitrogen bases to check for mutation or mistakes. The mistakes are found and labeled to be change, then an enzyme comes to re-do the mistaken nitrogen bases.
it will travel down. it carries the insturction on what to do and how to react
tRNArRNAmRNA
The mRNA leaves the nucleus and matches up with tRNA. Then it splits and creates a new, complimentary strand of RNA.
mRNA leaves the nucleus then it sends messages to the nucleus telling the organenelles what to do and what to fight off.
The four main steps involed in protein synthesis are transcription, translation, sequencing, and separating. Transcription is when the RNA is read and translation is when the new RNA strans are made.
The relay messages.
After the mRNA leaves the nucles, it sets out to find the ribosome to make rRNA and give the needed amino acid code that is needed to make proteins. After completing this, it transforms into tRNA to transfer the code. After getting the needed amino acids, it then transforms back into mRNA and heads back to the nucleus.
1.     mRNA transcripts tRNA2.     tRNA goes to the ribosome3.     tRNA transcripts and the amino acids are made when the             base pairs join4.     The left over bases are removed from the cell by the                    lysosome.
When mRNA leaves the nucleus, it goes to rRNA, and then it changes to tRNA, which carries instructions from the nucleus for the amino acids.
mRNA directs the RNA to make the protiens, then a signal from the nucleus tells it to stop.
when the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it divides the new DNA into all of the different cells.
after it leaves the nucleus it then goes to the tRNA to give it some memory. then after that it goes to the rRNA to make more ribosomes.
the messenger RNA conects to amino acids to give'directions' to them. Protiens are then conected to the mRNA an connected to the amino acids creating more RNA
mRNA leaving the nucleus
1. The mRNA is split in half.2. One half of the mRNA runs through a ribosome.3. While the half of the mRNA is being ran through the ribosome, a protien is being made according to the instructions. 4. The protien travels to wherever it is 'programmed' to go, and to do whatever it is 'programmed' to do.
wellll, i think the first one might be meiosis or Mitosisbut i really don`t have any idea so i`m just taking a wild guess so i don`t get this question wrong(:kthanks for the poinnts
1. RNA ARRIVES- FROM OTHER CELL2.RNA COPIED- TRANSLATION  3.RNA TRANPORTED- THROUGH mRNA4. RNA LEAVES- TO GO TO OTHER CELL
after the mRNA leaves the nucleus it binds with the rRNA. after they bind together they begin transciption to make more copies for more protiens. After transcription occurs translation begins to decode the RNA that has been made . After this has been done the RNA then begins to made amino acid that will form protiens.
In protein synthesis, the mRNA must first leave the nucleus. It then goes to the cytoplasm where it attaches to a ribosome. From there, it attaches to its complimentary codon. And finally becomes a protein strand.
The mRNA leaves then nucleus. It goes and copies a protien for the sequence. It returns to the nucleus. It transfers the protein
It goes to the to the nuclues then gets coded on the DNA and then turns into waste
meosis,mitosis,antaphase,telophase
The four major steps involved in protein synthesis are prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase
one: how they got the mRNAtwo: what they are going to do with the nucleusthree: how they are planning on doing itfour: why they are going to change
they all do there job
1. Proteins leaves the nuclei2. Proteins become stable3.Orgenelles become numerous4.The reproduction rate becomes high
1. First mRNA sends a message to the protein strand and tells it what amino acids it needs to build the strand.2. Then the tRNA goes and gets the codons from the amino acids so they can build their protein.3. Next they group the codons in three so they can be read so they know what amino acids to get.4. Last they put the amino acids in order, and then you get a protein strand.
its good for youmakes you stronggood for health
mRNA then codes for pretiens that bind with rRNA
Protein is distributed through the ribosomes and stored through out the cell after the mRNA tells it what to do.
1. mRNA carries instructions from the nucleus for the amino acid sequence of a protein.
anaphase,metaphase,prophase,interphase
protein gos into the blood and around the body. it helps to keep muscles storng.
Prophase, Anaphase, Interphase, Metaphase. Protein synthesis is carried out through a long process.
duplication, translocation , replication ,mitosis
In protein sythesis the mRNA travels to ribosomes in the cytoplasm. There, a ribosome reads the code on the mRNA. As the ribosome reads the code, tRNA find free amino acids and bring them to the mRNA to be arranged. When they are arranged they form peptide bonds that help them to serve their function as a protein.
After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it enters into the cytoplasm, where it docks at a ribosome made of rRNA. Next, tRNA reads the codons and using its anticodons goes out into the cytoplasm to pick up the amino acid that corresponds. It then travels back to the mRNA and connects its amino acid with the one previously set before it. Once the tRNA reaches the stop codon, the polypeptide chain is released and a protein has formed.
the mRNA leaves the nucleas and goes to tRNA which transfers the codons and anticodons then which gets translated into a sequence which produces amino acids and then in the sequence makes proteins.
The mRNA finds a ribosome to conduct protein synthesis on.  Once the mRNA finds the ribosome the AUG codon starts the protein synthesis.  Next, tRNA bring the correct anti-codons to the mRNA for the construction of the protein.  Once the tRNA have delivered the correct anti-codons they leave to go and be recharged and get more anti-codons.  The anti-codons are then paired up the the codons on the mRNA strand, and peptide bonds form between each of the anticodons.  When the stop codon is reached the protein is completly made.
1.the RNA goes into a ribosome2. transfer RNA brings amino acids to mach the sequence of the mRNA.3. as more tRNA comes  with more amino acids the amino acids start to stack up4.the compleated protins breaks away.
mRNA then sends its message to the nuclear membrane to creat certain DNA codes for it.  Then the sequence of creating DNA begins.
ANAPHASE, PROPHASE.METEPHASE, AND TELEPHASE
The tRNA will deliver instructions from the nucleus for the amino acid sequence to produce proteins.
-RNA, IT HAPPENS-DNA, IT REALLY HAPPENS-rRNA, THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN-mRNA, I REALLY HOPE THAT THIS HAPPENS
tRNA, rRNA, transcription, translocation, transference
The four strands. The production of protein. Helping the mRNA in able for it to complete the synthesis. The proteins are assembled.
Next, tRNA change the RNA strands from As,Ts, Cs, and Gs to As, Us, Cs, and Gs so that it can be read by something that I can't remember. But then it's changed back to its original state and paired with anti-codons that are attached to amino acids. The anti-codons break off so that only the amino acid remains. Once the anti-codons reach the stop codon, the amino acid chain breaks off and is now a protein.
One step involves the golgi apparatus in which it helps carry proteins.Another step uses the ER which helps get rid of unwanted or wasted material involving the proteins.Lysosomes also help break down things that can help with protein synthesis.
First, the mRNA leaves the nucleus and a ribosome attatches to it. Second, the ribosome reads every three nucleotide sequence, or codon, and calls for a tRNA molecule that has an anticodon to compliment the codon. Third, after this process is repeated, the amino acids on the tRNA molecules form peptide bonds with each other, forming a protein. Finally, after the mRNA is translated until a stop codon, the protein is released and used in the cell as needed.
1. First the nucleus would go through Metaphase.     2. Second the nucleus would go through Anaphase.3. Third the nucleus would go through Telophase.4. Last the nucleus would go through Cytokenisis.
After leaving the nucleus, mRNA goes to the ribosomes and turns into tRNA. Once it becomes tRNA, it makes codons or becomes anticodons. Once it becomes codons, it makes amino acids.
1. It turms into tRNA and travels to the ribosome.2. It picks up surrounding amino acids and takes them to the ribosome.3. It forms rRNA and begins binding the amino acids in the ribosome.4.  It then forms a new strand of RNA.
collecting nutriants, storing them, anaphase , and then there is prophase
1. They have proteins2. they help wit mRNA3. 4
First mRNA leaves the nucleus with a strand of DNA which contains the instructions to making an amino acid. It takes the DNA strand to the tRNA in the ribosomes. There the tRNA uses the codons to make the sequence of amino acids. The amino acids are then transferred by the tRNA to the rRNA where they become a protein.
mRNA leaves the nucleus carrying instructions for the amino acid sequence to create proteins. First the mRNA will send the instructions to the needed part of the cell, then this will turn into dna. Thirdly proteins would begin to be ensembled in the correct part of the cell and lastly they would be released into the body where they are needed.
Next, mRNA attaches to a ribosome where the code on it will be translated to the order of amino acids needed to make a protein.  rRNA combines with the ribosome to help chain the amino acids to form a polypeptide chain.  tRNA finds amino acids that match with the code it carries and takes carries them to the ribosome where it matches its amino acids to the code on teh mRNA.  All of the the amino acids at the ribosome form a polypeptide which is then formed into a protein.
1. The mRNA takes the coded DNA to tRNA2. The tRNA takes the coded DNA and translates it to amino acids.3. The rRNA copies the amino acids4. They are placed as traits.
The first step is where the mRNA goes to the ribosones  soo they DNA can be replicated. The second step is wjere the tRNA gets added with the DNA. The third step is  when the tRNA foes back to the nucleus to get added to the DNA. i cant remember the last.
The mRNA must copy its self
mRNA is when it carries information to tRNA which then carries instructions from the nuclues to the amino acid sequence for the protein. rRNA then takes the information to the center of all the protein synthesis.
The mRNA moves to the outside of the nucleus.The mRNA then moves to the outside of the cell.The mRNA then delivers the DNA to another nucleus.The DNA is made into another cell.
First the mRNA leaves the nucleus, than the mRNA goes to the cell membrane, next the mRNA will multiply in the cell membrane than the mRNA will start to go to the nucleus and start all over again.
Four major steps involved in protein synthesis are mRNA leaving the nucleus,
RnarRnatRnagRna
It enters. It grows. It breaks down. It leaves.
tRNA carries instruction from nucleus for amino acid sequence of a protein.
The four major steps involved in protien synthesis are rRNA, tRNA, gRNA the process ends.
1. gets DNA messages spreading through the cell2. delivers DNA codes3. helps break down DNA codes needed for cell cycle4. releases protein into the cell
start codon, code for RNA, protein is made, stop codon
The mRNA leaves the nucleus and goes to the ribosome. Where tRNA then translates the mRNA into proteins.
mRNA leaving the nucleustRNArRNA
The mRNA comes to the ribosme where then the DNA is decoded by tRNA. The tRNA then tanslates the codons which then attaches the correct amino acid to the tRNA. Each of the segments have their own amino acid which they then all are bonded by peptide bonds to create a protein.
after mRNA it will go to tRNA and then i will coil so much to where it becomes DNA
it slowly leaves it.
It just puts protein out through the body to keep it healthy and gives you energy to do things.
The tRNA Comes in and copies itselfThen the mRNA sends protiens to all the tRNAThen the mRNA comes back Then it adds another mRNA
The first stepis mRNA connects to the ribosome to keep it in place.  Secondly tRNA brings the anticodons and they match with the bases pair.  On the third step another tRNA brings another anticodon and the amino acids at the end stick togather. And the fourth step is that these steps are repeated and all the amino acids stick together and form a protein until they get to the stop codon.
The prophase lets the RNA form the chromosomes. Metaphase lines them in the middle. Anaphase seperates them on opposite ends of the cell. Then Telophase seperates them into new cells
mRna gives the message to tRna wich transfers the message to the gRna wich sends it to th rRna wich then makes it into protiens.
mRNA leaves the nucleus. then passes on the information needed to make proteins. the cells gather and conect the parts needed to make the protein. the last step is finished to form and pass on the protein.
Step 1 the mrna goes out and grabs the sequence that is needed. Step2 the mrna sequnce choosen then codes for tranlation. The trna then takes the base pair codes and goes out and grabs the aminoacids.Step3 the amino acid sequence would then be added to the original. Step4 a new strand with a new sequence would be formed.
After mRNA leaves the nucleus production of information must be recived and retained by rRNA.  After that it processes the information and moves it with tRNA.  Then mRNA recives it again and makes more.  It all happens again after that and the making of proteins occur over and over again.
The mRNA goes to a ribosme.Then it gets fitted with an amino acid. Then it becomes tRNA. Then it can be used as a protien.
1. mRNA leaves the nucleus and sends amino acid sequence to the rRNA2. rRNA goes to the mitochondria and gives it instruction to build the protein3. once protein is  created, tRNA attaches to a hydrogen atom4. tRNA carries the hydrogen to the protein and forms a covalent bond with the protein
Attaching to a strand of DNA.
mRNA carries the protein from on part of the cell to another. the mRNA get the orders to go to the ribosomes and get the proteins to take it where it needs to go.
tRNA transfers the data to the cytoplasmrRNA-makes the proteins
1. The mRNA leaves the nucleus to take the information of the amino acid to the protein2. The tRNA go out to get amino acids. 3. The tRNA bring the amino acids back to the nucleus.4. They attach them to the strand of DNA.
the steps following are transcription, initiation, elongation, termination,
trna,dna,rna,mrna?
all T's are tuned int U's. the mRNA is translated into codons. codons ar turned into ameno acids. ameno acids are turned into a proteins
1. mRNA starts to decode the DNA2. 3.4. Protein and RNA Structures are finished.
mRNA must first translate the amino acid into a 'language' that can be read then the mRNA has to transcribe the amino acid so that it can be used.
1) the ribosones collect the mRNA.2) the ribosomes biuld the mRNA into the correct sequence.3) transcription happens.4) the mRNA is pair and attached to the DNA, creating a protein
After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it meets up with a RNA polymerase which begins to read the sequence at a start codon. As it reads the mRNA codons and tRNA begin bringing amino acids as they are called for by the mRNA. These amino acids are then joined together in the sequence ordered by the mRNA. Once it reaches the stop codon, it stops and the new protein made of all te amino acids is taken away.
they make a copy of the DNA and then they replicate it and then translate it.
Goes through the Golgi, then through the blood stream to the endoplasmic reticulum, then passes the mitchocondria, the mitosis occurs.
Protein synthesis occurs by mRNA transporting it to the endoplasmic reticulum. Then the protein is copied and then split several times again. Then the proteins copies are later returned to the nucleus and used from then on out.
mRNA then goes to the tRNA where  the tRNA  makes an exact copy of the template. The tRNA  then matches  up with the correct spot on the organelle. Then the organelle makes a protein that the  body needs and sends it to  were  it is needed.
DNA is copied into a smaller form called messanger RNA or mRNA and then that is copied into tranfer RNA or tRNA to be transfered and replectated once the nucleotide sequences are copied back into mRNA then a new cell has a new set of complete DNA.
First the mRna leaves the nucleus. The next step is to divided the ATP's. After that one energy leaves the ATP. Then it is given a new name.
Transcription, translation
1: The mRNA changes into tRNA.2: The tRNA caries proteins to where theyre supposed to go.3: The tRNA changes into proteins, and goes where the other proteins went.4: The body uses those protiens for a variety of things, such as, making new muscle, or healing a cut, or exercise.
TRANSCRIPTION: THE PROCESS OF COPYING THE DNA AND MAKING THE mRNA.THE mRNA IS THEN DELIVERED TO THE RIBOSOMETRANSLATION: THE mRNA IS READ BY tRNATHEN THE CELL PRODUCES PROTIEN BY BUILDING IT
Anaphase, metaphase, telaphase, and prophase.
Translation is when DNA is copied into RNA then the RNA is copied into mRNA in transcription.
1.mRNA will pass tRNA a message2.tRNA will pass the message to the mitochondria3.The mitochodria gets the message and produce proteins4.The proteins are produced
PROPHASE METAPHASE ANAPHASE AND TELOPHASE
The first thing it does is that is travels throught the cells cytoplasm to to ribosomes. Then the ribosomes help turn it into protein. The protein is taken my tRNA back to the nucleus and then the prosess starts all over again.
Transaction.translation.transcription
After mRNA leaves the nucleus, transcription and translation occur. Transcription is the copying of the strand and translation is moving the sequences for the strand. There is also replication which makes an exact replicate of the DNA strand.
protein sythis builds up over time wich makes it easer for animal and many other things to get stronger and stronger through out time. this cause some problemsfor many weak animals that are not as strong out there to just get eaten and killed by many stronger predators.
When the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it then will take the information to tRNA so tRNA can then transfor the information.
After the mRNA leave the nucleus, tRNA come in and gets a gentic copy of the mRNA. The tRNA detaches from the mRNA. Then takes the information to make a amino acid sequence.
it has the protiens which are being transfered to the DNA stran so it can join togethr then break off to make an entirely new DNA strand.
the mRNA is decoded and ine infermation is copied and used to creat the protiens
It goes to the nucleus. Then from there it goes to the cell membrane. After that it travels to the Golgi apperatous. Finally it goes to the cytoplasm.
mRNA leaves the nucleus, transcription happens where the message is transcribed, then it gets translated, then it goes to the ribosome where a new when gets made.
Mrna leaves th nucleus to send a meesage to TrnaMrna tells Trna to go get more genetic codestrna carries instructions from the nucleas for the amino acid sequence of a proteinand complets the strand of dna in the ribosome
When mRNa leaves the nucleus, there are four major steps involved for protein synthesis. They are prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. They help with meiosis. Prophase is where the nuclear membrane dissapear and the chromosomes split. Metaphase is where the chromosomes line up. Anaphase is where the chromosomes go off into groups, and telophase is when they gain the nuclear membrane back.
When the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it travels through the cell.  It moves to a ribosome.  The ribosome makes tRNA.  Then, protien is synthesized.
transcriptionreplicationtranslation
The mRNA leaves the nucleus, and is then synthesized into tRNA, which carries the code for making proteins. The tRNA is transcribed into rRNA which can then be used by the body to synthesize proteins.
Making the protein, getting things to assemble the protein, getting information on how to make protein, synthesizing protein.
After mRNA leaves the nucleus it goes through the endoplasmic reticulum, which filters the bad protiens out, then it is released into the cytoplasma of the cell, then it leaves the cell and transports diferent material to a different cell.
tRNAgRNAmRNArRNA
First, it goes to the cells and then the cells take it and follow the directions. Then they Copy it and make more DNA.
1. Mitocandiria
mRNA leaves.     Gives the code to tRNA.     tRNA gives the amino acid to the protien.     They mix.
Translation
mRNA,tRNA,and rRNAmRNA sends messages to the nuclues. tRNA transports proteins through the cell. And rRNA makes ribosomes for the cell.
The tRNA transfers data.
1. mRNA copies into tRNA2. tRNA transfers to a double helix3. the tRNA copies to another DNA4. there are two copies of DNA
When the mRNA leaves the nucleus, 1. it goes to the endoplasmic reticulum where protein synthesis begins.  2. Ribosomes then move in to begin the process of synthesis where anticodons are moved on to the correct codons transferring the correct amino acid code that is to be made. 3. the amino acid is made and attached to all other amino acids beside it with Peptide bonds. 4. A stop codon tells the amino acids to stop and the previous amino acid becomes the last in the chain, making a complete protein.
it copies itself then it translates then it transcripts
Prtein synthesis takes place after leaving the nucleus. The four major steps are movement, reproduction, growth and  new rna.
MRNA as a polymer is involved in protein synthesis. THey are making the proteins snythesis with each other.Step 1: To arrive where the proteins are2: brake the proteins up3: conncet proteins again with Rna 4: the process is complete
transcription, ribosome calls for amino acids, translation. proteins are made by the amino acids binding together.
Transportation: DNA becoming mRNA.transcription: mRNA becoming protiens.peptide bonds: Holding the protiens together.deoxirybose: The sugar in the protiens, it helps make the protiens.
The first step in protein synthesis is after leaving the nucleus the mRNA will look for the protein. The second step is the mRNA will copy the protein.  The therd step is that the mRNA will make new protein and the final step is the mRNA will head back to the nucleus.
first the DNA turns into mRNA then the mRNA is turned into RNA through the process of transcription.then the RNA leaves the nucleus and goes through a process of translation.then signals for the tRNA.Then the tRNA makes the proteins.
During protein synthesis, mRNA leaves the nucleus.  The tRNA takes the anti-codon and matches it with the corresponding codon on the mRNA molecule.  It attaches on the ribosome.    This then makes the amino acid polypeptide chain.  Once those steps are complete, you have the protein that the mRNA was coded for.
The mRNA goes to out of the cell and travels to the others cells and then comes back into the cell to repeat the process.
The DNA is copied by the mRNA. Then is translated by the tRNA. then for every 3 strands of codons are translated an amino acid chain is formed. Then when the code for stop happens a protein is formed.
After the the mRNA leaves the cells nuclaer envolope throught the pores in the envolope the m RNA seeks out a ribosome ( an organelle that synthisize protien based on the codons it get for the messenge RNA)  to synthisize the proteins it has codons for. After the mRNA finds a ribosome to synthisize the proteins it attaches on to the ribosome for it to read the codon sequance it contians. A codone is a sequence of three molacuole of nueclear acid that when read stand for one amino acid ( Amino Acid- the building blocks for proteins) As the ribosomes read the codon sequence, the ribosome calls tRNA to retrive the amino acids it need to create a protien chain. After a protein chain has been made the mRNA has no more use and it desolves back into the cytoplasm. After the protien chain has been fully synthisied it get sent to the rought endoplasmic reticulum to have final touches added to it. After all the final touches are added to the protein chain, it is then sent to the golgi apparatus to be prepare to be shipped out to another part of the body. After the golgi apparatus has prepared the protein chain to be shipped out it is then sent to the cell membrance to exit through a protein channal. After the protein has exited the cell it is shiped off else where in the body to be used
The mRNA leaves the nucleus through a process called prophase, then the cell gets ready to dived with interphase, ten the cell starts to seperate with interphase, then the cell is finished seperating with metaphase
mRNA reads the message to the other parts of the cell.tRNA transfers carries the message to the other parts of the cell.
mRNA sends the message to the ribosome so the ribosome knows what codons to make for the proteins so the right proteins are made.  The proteins are then sent to the areas of the body that they are needed in.
The mRNA brings the information to the tRNA. The tRNA transports the codons to the mitochondrion. The mitochondrion synthesizes the proteins, and the tRNA transports the proteins to where they need to go.
The first step is anaphase. Which that is still in it's nucleus. The second step is prophase. Which that is starting to split into two different cells. The third step is telephase. Which is were they split apart. The fourth step is metaphase. Which is were the cells are apart and at on there own.
first they leave the body, then copy themselves, then transfer, last they make a new strand
After leaving the nucleus there are a few steps in protein synthesis.  mRNA enters the ribosome and prepares for transcription.  In transcription the enzyme, RNA polymerase binds to DNA and splits the two strands apart.  It then uses one strand as a template for nucleotides to form a strand of RNA.  Then it has to go into translation.  mRNA is used as instructions for decoding.  The ribosome is what makes the protein.
1.) Transcription- where tRNA codes for a certain amino acid. 2.) The amino acid is created according to what the tRNA coded for.3.) The sequence is held together by peptide bonds.4.) The amino acid sequence is taken back by the mRNA
First the mRNA leaves the nucleus after it got transcribed from half of a strand of DNA. The small and large ribosomes then attach to the RNA to translate it. The codons get translated to an amino acid, and the small and large ribosomes pull the needed amino acid over and go to the next codon. They do this until they have a long strand of amino acids to make a protein.
mRNa goes into translation were the protiens move. Then tRNA were it unzips. Then were it is moved again and, then it zips up again.
The mRNA makes a  copy of the DNA strand. the mRNA gives it the tRNA that sends. then the rRNAmakes a protien chain. the protien chain then moves and makes a new cell.
One step is microevolution.
tRNA, is the transporterRNA,DNA, the structure of an organismmRNA,
The four major steps are transcription, transportation, conversion, and rRNA.
mRNA leaves the nucleusmRNA turns to tRNAtRNA then transfers the info to another part of the cellthe info is then read and the protein is created.
First, the mRNA attaches to a ribosome and then the ribosome reads the mRNA in segments of three, called codons. For each codon, there is a complementary amino acid. Secondly, tRNA picks up the needed amino acids and brings them to the ribosome. Thirdy, the amino acids attach to each other and form a chain of amino acids according to the way in which the codons are read on the mRNA strand by the ribosome. The chain continues to form until the ribosome reaches the stop codon on the mRNA strand. Lastly, the ribosome disconnects from the mRNA strand and the protein is relased to perform its job in the cell.

It has to go through all the RNA first then it goes to the protein synthesis. Then it leaves the nucleus.
mRNA, RNA, DNA
1) Leave the nucleus2) Run through the system3) Get towards the end4) Leave the system5) Live Happily Ever After (:
1. the DNA turns into mRNA.2.then the mRNA turns into tRNA3.the cycle happens over again
The mRNA leaves the nucleus and transcribes the DNA codes to the tRNA. Then the tRNA turns these codes into RNA codes. From there the rRNA makes doubles of all of the new information.
They carry all the information from the nucleus for the amino acid of the protein. They have to make new copies of the information to put for tRNA. Then they leave the nucleus and the tRNA travels in.
1.The mRNA gets packaged up by the Golgi Apparatus.2.The proteins travel through the Endoplasmic Reticulum.3.The nucleus sends information to tell the ribosomes how to make the protein and for what functions.4.Ribosomes make the protein and is put into use.
tRNA breaks loose and grabs onto amino acids. mRNA leaves the nucleus and goes over to the ribosome. tRNA goes to the ribosome with the Amino acids. mRNA bonds everything together.
Sending ribosomal messages.

The first step is, that mRNA leaves the nucleas. The mRNA then gets the tRNA to make a covalent bond.
Metephase-Where the cell still has it's nuclues.Prophase- the step where the nucleus dissapears and the organisms start to form a line for seperation.Telephase- The last step before the cell divides, the organisms inside the cell seperate to different ends of the cell to get ready for anaphase. The line is fromed in the middle of the cell.Anaphase- where the cell divides into two cells.
The mRNA goes to the ribosomes for the instructions on making protein.  It then goes to the mitochondria to get energy. They it goes back to the nucleus to produce the protein.
IT BRAKES DOWN INTO SMALLER PARTS AND THEN IS SHIPPED  TO DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE BODY SO IT CAN BE USED AS ENERGY
when the mRNA leaves the nucleous, the protiens go with it
THE tRNA COMING AND BRINGING THE AMINO ACIDS.mRNA TAKING THE AMINO ACIDS TO THE RIBOSOMES WHERE THEY ARE MADE
they match up with the DNA sequence, put into bonds that were copied, and then changed
mRNa leaves. light goes in.
it leaves the nucleus and helps the cell find protiens for the cell and help it survive and make it healthy.
After mRNA leaves the nuclues, it goes to ribosomal RNA. Each tRNA anticodon is attached to an amino acid found in the cytoplasm and comes to the rRNA. The tRNA forms the complement of the mRNA strand, and the attached amino acids connect to one another until a STOP codon is reached.
1. mRNA leaves the nucleus carry the message from the cell membrane.2. rRNAcarries the ribosome to the codon3. tRNA transfers the segment needed to be traslated.4. the Condon strand is translated.
mRNA sends messages on what to transcript
Prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telephase.
1. After mRNA leaves the nucleus it travels to the ribosome where rRNA recognizes the mRNA strand and a start codon and coordinates the ribosome to attache to the mRNA.2. Once the mRNA is within the ribosome, sections of three nitrogenous bases are identified on the mRNA strand, otherwise known as a codon, and a corresponding anticodon attached to tRNA and an amino acid are signalled to attach.3.tRNA continues to attach itself to the mRNA strand via the identification process aided by codons and anticodons. In doing so the tRNA, which have attached amino acids, begin to form a string of amino acid that are attached together by peptide bonds to form a protein.4. Once the the protein has been formed, which is usually composed of around 20 amino acids, the ribosome comes to a stop codon which signals for the protein to be released from the ribosome. From there the protein then folds up into a three dimensional shape in order to function properly.
Amino acid makes the protienthe protien does stuff with the ribosome
IT GOES TO THE MICHOCHINDRIA AND STARTS ATTACHING CODONS TO MAKE APROTEIN
mRNA leaves the nucleus, then it arrives a a ribosome where it is turned in to tRNA. Then ammino acid prduction begins and segments of the tRNA are copied to produce them.

The mRNA leaves the nucleus.The mRNA goes to the tRNA and transcribes its information.The tRNA goes to a ribosome.The tRNA translates onto the rRNA and begins making proteins.
the mRNA leaves the nucleus with the information to build the protein. the mRNA takes the information to the ribosome, which then reads the information in sequences of three, called codons.  Then the Ribosome will search for the correct codon, which is carried by the tRNA. this creates a sequence of amino acids, and when there are the correct amount of amino acids, it is created into a protein.
the tRNA leave the cell,realesespeptic bonds, it eneter the nuclus and the Mrna
It goes through to the passive transport and then the selectrive membrane chooses what is good and what is bad. The bad stuff then goes out of the cell and the good is then taken to the mitochondria to be put to proper use.

Step 1: mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the cytoplasm.Step 2: rRNA copies the strand of mRNA.Step 3: tRNA takes the copies to get a new strand of nucleotides.Step 4: The mRNA matches up with its tRNA and the nucleotides make a protein.
The first amnio acid comes and attaches to the mRNA then dehydration synthesis occurs. After that the hydrogen bond brakes and that amnio acid goes to find more protien. then that procees continues.
well you might have to go through the cleanins and purifing stage
1. the mRNA goes with the protien sythesis to the rough ER.2. the tRNA then proceeds with the information for protein production.3.
the mRNA delivers the message so its like the messenager.
The mRNA leaves the nucles and is then coped by ribosomes and is turned into the protein.
The mrRNA then moves to the mitochondria. From there the mitochondria reads the sequence of mRNA. Once the sequence is read a supplementary copy is made. The supplementary copy is then synthesized by the mitochondria.
When the mRNA leaves the nucleus it gets strands then it creates sequences and they turn into amino acids. After turning into amino acids they become energy.
LEAVES NUCLEUS, ENTERS BODY, DELIVERS MESSAGES ABOUT AMINO ACID SEQUENCE, HEADS BACK TO NUCLEUS
It would go through the nucleus and it would send the mRNA to tRna and the tRNA would transfer it to rRna.
First, the newly formed mRNA branches away from the stand of DNA. Second, the information carried by the mRNA is transported to a new cell. Third, the information carried by the mRNA is copied into the new cell. Lastly, the cell then creates the DNA structures that were copied.
DNA, TRNA, RRNA, & AMINO ACIDS
When mRNA, also known as the messanger RNA, leaves the nucleous and attaches onto an rRNA, ribosome, the rRNA matches the mRNA to a tRNA.  The ribosome takes three mRNA at a time and docks them untill the tRNA comes with the match and each match has a code.  The code AUG means to start that way the body knows when to start protein synthesis.

The mRNA leaves the nucleus then goes to the cytoplasm where the protein is made, is met by a tRNA which takes the protein and moves it away, then the protein is released.
1. mRNA leaves the nucleus2. Two nuclei come together3. Then they go apart4. Finally they become more powerful
First the proteins go through a check process, then the cell membrane fixes anything that is wrong, then the nucleotides make bind to the mRNA, and finally the mRNA and the protein bind together.
The first step, as already stated, is the mRNA leaving the nucleus to be formed into a protein.  The mRNA then encounters rRNA (the ribosome), which begins reading off the codons on the mRNA to begin forming a protein.  Transfer RNA then comes with anticodons to form amino acids that form together to create the protein.
It travels throught the ER then the Golgi Apperatus.
After mRNA has left the nucleus, it floats around until it finds a matching strand.  After it has found its matching strand, the two strands line up and then connect to each other creating a protein.

anaphase, telephase, prophase and interphase.
it goes to tRNA then to Rna itself
RNA is crossed over, the DNA is synthesised with the mRNA, and the leftover strands are leftover and sythisised with other DNA now
mRNA leaves the nucleus then the chromosomes split, move to different sides and create two new cells
mrna leaves the nucles, the rna carries instructions from the nucleus, the ribosomes use the instructions, the ribosomes make proteins
Starting with mRNA, it leaves the nucleus, then it sends its instructions for the amino acid sequence of a protein. It returns back as tRNA. It transfers the protein to the nucleus.
The mRNA goes to the ribosome were the P site and A site attach. The tRNA brings the anticodon and the amino acid. The anticodon matches with the correct codon. The amino acids that the tRNAs have brought over all connect in the correct formation.
The mRNA leaves the nucleus and docks into a ribosome. Then, tRNA that fits comes and attaches to the mRNA. The tRNA then builds up into Amino Acids that link together to become a protein.
First, mRNA leaves the nucleus. Then, the mRNA enters a ribosome. The ribosome then reads the mRNA sequence and sends for tRNA, which brings a codon pairing with the one shown in the mRNA as well as an amino acid. This repeats, with the amino acids joining together, eventually making a protein.
DNA is unzipped, copied and zipped back up. The copied strand is the mRNA /wich is then copied also..
Major steps in protien synthesis is the mRNA leaves the nucleus. It separates strands and divides out of the nuleus's walls. Then the new copy is sent inside the nucleus. I new protien is made. There are many parts to this process but these are the main ones
mRNA leaves.......organelles appear.....mutation starts......the mitochondrian is working harder......
In protein synthesis, after the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it carries the instructions to the cytooplasm.  It then enters a ribosome and prepares to be copied.  Transfer RNA brings the codons attached to the amino acid to the ribosome. It attaches at the first bonding site which  matches the complementary codons. THe tRNA the moves on the the next bonding site where it releases the amino acid which attaches to the amino acid on the tRNA behind it.  Once the mRNA reaches a stop codon, the amino acids detach and form a polypeptide bond.
Transcription, Translation
mRNA, then it a messanger to the DNA then to defusion.
Interphase,Metaphase,Anaphase and Telophase.
Well the first step is basically just the mRNA leaving the nucleus and then moving on up in the world, because you know what? The nucleus wasn't a very happy being, ultimately ending with the mRNA not liking the treatment he was recieving so he left. The second stage is the mRNA getting his own place so he can start out fresh and brand new. He settles down and finds himself a nice woman mRNA strand and they eventually have some children and live the good life.Stage three consists of the everyday life of mRNA at his work place, basically its just his day as he works and manages his life whether it be personal or business.The fourth and final stage is the overall story summed up and then it shows the family live happily ever after and even has Mr. mRNA thanking the nucleus for not liking him and forcing him to leave and roam the free world to find a better life, a more prosperous and fulfilling one.
1. mRNA (messenger RNA) leaves the nucleus with instructions from the nucleus to amino acids for a sequence of a protein.2. tRNA (transfer RNA) transfers the DNA sequence by codons and figures out the genetic code. 3. rRNA (ribosomial RNA) gives the information to a ribosome organelle which now holds all the information.4. the rRNA carries the information back to the nucleus so it can carry out the process and retain the genetic information that it recieved.
ProphaseMetaphaseAnaphaseTelophasehaha i dont know =)
Translation, Transcription, Transport, and tRNA are the steps for protein synthesis.
The mRNA goes to the ribosome where the tRNA translates the mRNA's codons into peptide chains that then make a polypeptide chain that goes with others to make a protien.
mRNA carries instructions from the nucleus for the amino acid sequence of a protien.

Prophase, anapahase, metaphase, telophase
protects the cell
The four major steps involved in protein synthesis is:  1. Interphase- are starting to make own chromosomes 2. Prophase-  3. Metaphase- getting itself ready to split into two different parts 4. Cytokensis- were the two seperate.
When mRNA leaves the nucleus, it goes into the cytoplasm and delivers the message to all ribosomes, telling them to make this certain type of protein. The ribosomes then start producing this protein. From there, the proteins enters the Endoplasmic Reticulum to be connected and checked for defects. After that, it goes into the Golgi Apparatus to be synthesised and packaged to go out into the rest of the cell.
4 major steps involved in protein synthesis is: number 1 the proteins level on top of each other, 2 the strands have to open up, 3 the ball of protein is able to slide through, 4 its on the other side
Starting with mRNA it goes through trna, rrna
mRNAtRNAmmRNA
copyingmutating crossing overreading the cell
Breaking down other protein.  Making new protein. And using the new protein.
Once the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it makes its way through the cell and to the mitocondriton. From there it goes through a cycle and
1 The mRNA takes the energy to the ribosomes.2 It then gives the energy to the tRNA.3 The tRNA transfers this energy into the ribosomes.4 The ribosomes turn the energy into protein.
First the mRNA leaves the nucleus and locates in the cytoplasm at the ribosomes. Once it was relocated to the ribosomes it is transfered into rRNA and then read by the tRNA. Once the tRNA reads the information amino acids are produced and they are the building blocks of proteins.
1. Replication- Produces exact cell2. Translation- Creates mRNA3. Transversal- Created tRNA
mRNA carries the protein, then carries it to tRNA, tRNA moves binds it.
1. mRNA leaves the nucleus.2. Then the mRNA travels to the ER and rough ER.3. Both of the ER's then make the proteins.4. Finally the proteins are transported to the ribosomes where they are held until needed.
Four major step are involved whenever the mRNA leaves the nucleus. The first major step is that the mRNA becomes attached to a ribosome. The next step is that the mRNA joins with the tRNA. The third step is that for every three codons the tRNA creat anit-codons. The last step is the making of the amino acids by the tRNA transfering the anti-codons into amino acids, which is needed fpr tje reproduction of DNA.
1. mRNA reaches the ribosome.2. The mRNA is read and is copied.3. The mRNA sequence is copied to tRNA.4. The tRNA is then copied and the copies are used to make more proteins.
Step 1-they collect the DNA and leave the nucleusStep 2-it gets transferred to the ribosomesStep 3-amino acids are formedStep 4-proteins are built by the amino acids
The mRNA moves from the nucleus to the RNA. Then the rRNA begins to read the mRNA. The tRNA goes to get an amino acid and brings it back to the rRNA. Once it has the amino acid, the protein begins to be replicated.
A protien attatches to the mRNA and makes a copy of it. The copy is the same sequence, but it is the opposite sequence. The sequences then matches up with the amino acids that pair up with each amino acid. The mRNA is now a different form of RNA.
The mRNA will reach a ribosome. The tRNA will find the amino acid that the mRNA needs. The amino acids will stick together. A protein will be made out of the amino acid strand.
prophase-anaphase-metaphase-where the cells begins to splitinterphase-
1. The mRNA arives at the ribazones.2. The ribazones decode the mRNA.3. The ribazones use the decoded mRNA to mek proteins.4. The proteins are used for energy in the cell.
Once mRNA has left the nucleus it is transferd to tRNA in the cytoplasm and then the tRNA takes the information to the amino acid. This information tells the amino acids what to produce and then the proteins are produced from the information sent by mRNA.
When the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it goes through a process called transcription. The mRNA travels to a ribosome, and more proteins are made. As this is happening, the mRNA also continues to make more polypeptides on the strand. After this a complementary strand is formed, and another strand of DNA is made.
1. The mRNA leaves the nucleus.2. DNA begin stacking up.3.
the four major steps are interphase, prophase, anaphase, metaphase.
Prophase is where the parts of the cell move. Anaphase is where they break out of the nucleus. Metaphase is where the parts of the cell line up in the middle. Telaphase is where the cell divides.
4 steps involved in protein synthesis is mRNA is moving into the cytoplams, then it binds with the rRNA in ribosome, then tRNA binds its anticodon to the codon of the mRNA, then translation occurs and polypeptide chains of amino acids are formed.
The mRNA leaves the nucleus and goes and gets an amino acid that matches up on the tRNA strand. Then it goes back and gets more and more until the whole protein chain has been completed.
After mRNA leaves the nucleus the next step would be for it to deliver the information it is carrying. Then tRNA tranfers the information. The step would be for transcription, translation and transcibing.
carries instructions from the nucleus for the amino acid sequence of a protein
mRNA gives a message to tRNA that has what amino acids the DNA strand has. The tRNA brings the RNA to the DNA sequence and the RNA lines up with the amino acids. These make up proteins.
Translation- mRNA is translated into codonsTranscription- Codons code for amino acidsAmino acids are hooked together to create a chainThe chain creates a protein
Prophase, Anaphase, Telophase, Meiosis
The four major steps involved in protein sylnthesis is the mRNA leaves the nucleus then it goes and gets the message decoded. After that then the body sends out the proper proteins. Lastly the proper proteins are sent and the process is started all over again.
The mRNA enters the ribosome. It then begins translation when the anticodons from the tRNA match up with the codons on the mRNA. The starting codon is always Met. As the tRNA attaches to the mRNA, the amino acids above them form peptide bonds. Finally, the last step is the stop codon on the mRNA. This signals the end of protein synthesis.
proteins have to move through out the organism for cells and functions to work right.

The major part is amino acids being apart of it and helping us have what we need to survive.
anaphaseinterphasemetaphaseprophase
mRNA exits the nucleus, then it sends message to the ribosome. It does this by entering the ribosome, once here a amino acid is assembled. The acid is attached by a codon that was put forth due to the mRNA's message. After this the new amino acids is put forth and joined with others, this forms the protein.
mRNA leaves the nucleasmRNA codes for tRNAamino acids on tRNA bond to form a chain of amino acidsthe chain of amino acids folds into a protein.mRNA leaves the nucleas after being copied from DNA.  This mRNA is single stranded and contains codons for specific types of proteins.mRNA then travels to a ribosome.  At the ribosome, the mRNA is run through, and tRNA with anticodons on one end attach to the mRNA.Each tRNA particle has an amino acid attached on the opposite end of the anticodon.  When two tRNA particles connect to the mRNA at the same time, a peptide bond forms between the two amino acids and the first piece of tRNA can disconnect.  As this process continues, the amino acids begin to form a chain.Once the strand of mRNA contains a stop codon and tRNA reaches it, the final amino acid will bond to the chain.  Once this animo acid disconnects with the tRNA, the strand folds up into a specific protein.

The Double helix of DNA splits up and makes one strand of RNA.
The mRNA takes the copy to the cytoplasm. Then It gives the copy to the tRNA. The tRNA then takes it and makes a copy of it. Finally it is returned to the nucleus.
1. mRNA seperates from DNA and leaves the nucleus2. The mRNA gives information for making protein3. Codon signals start to make amino acids for proteins4. Sequence hits a stop codon and the protein is released into the cell
When the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it then goes out and gives the code to something else. That blue print is then taken to the ribosomes to make the protein.
1. mRNA heads to the Ribosome2. mRNA gets decoded3. tRNA grabs an amino acid and brings it back to the decoded mRNA4. rRNA  is taken back to the nucleus
The mRNA goes to the tRNA and they come together to make the proteins. After this the RNA link together to make DNA.
The mRNA goes to the ribosomes to deliver the genetic code from the nucleus.  The ribsomes connect the nucleic acids and send it to the Golgi Apparatus.  Then the Gogli aparatus gets rid of the bad proteins.  Then gets the good proteins ready to be used in the cell.
First, the mRNA leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm. Then, it is bonded to a ribosome and it starts to decode the mRNA. Next, the different nucleic acids arrive and match up with the mRNA codons. Last, the amino acid is formed, and the process continues at the Endoplasmic Reticulum where, eventually, all those amino acids make up a protein.
the ribosomes create the protein
The mRNA must first go to the ribosome. then the ribosome makes what ever it was told to make. After that tRNA come and transport the protien to its destenation.

The mRNA sends off the code to the mitochondria
First, the mRNA goes to a ribosome.  It connects with the ribosome and then tRNA comes and connects with the ribosome.  The tRNA reads the mRNA and pairs anticodons with the codons from the mRNA.  This forms an amino acid.  This continues to happen until you have a long chain of amino acids and the mRNA tells the tRNA to stop decoding.
1.the mRNA will have to be translated after it leaves the nucleus.2. When the strand is translated tRNA will add anticodons to it.3. tRNA will carry amino acids with it to bind to the strand. 4. the amino acids will bind creating a protein.
During protein synethesis, the DNA is being replicated and forming mRNA durning transcription. Then after it leaves the nucleus, it enters the cytoplasm. Translation takes place in the cytoplasm. A polypeptide chain forms during tanslation which turns into proteins. The tRNA carries 3 anticodons to the 3 condons on the mRNA. When that is all done it makes a chain of amino acids.

step one would be , your body produces the protein. Step two would be th protein then travels through your blood stream. Step three , the protein make's more of itself on its way through the body . Step four the protein finally reaches where its supposed to be.
The four major steps interphase telophase anaphase and prophase.
The first step in the  four major steps that involve in protein synthesis is the mRNA goes from the nucleus to the cell membrain; then the mRNA goes to the cell nucleus, and then the mRNA goes to the cell nucleolus. And last the cell goes to the cell nucleotide. Those are the four major steps in protein syntheses.
mRNA changes to amino acids the amino acids sends themselves to tRNa
The four major steps are prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase.
The mRNA goes somewhere else where it can copy to make DNA.
Translation - The DNA is translated into RNA.Transcription - The RNA is used in the cell.TrnaRrna Grna
First, the mRNA leaves the nucleus, carrying a specific nucleotide. The mRNA passes the nucleotide to tRNA. Then tRNA carries 2 nucleotides to an rRNA. rRNA completes the process with 3 nucleotides, coding for a protein. ?
The G1 phase starts and then it continues on to the S phase.  Next the S phase turns into the G2 phase.  Then the last step is called the G0 phase.  Then it starts all over again.
sugars
After mRNA leaves the nucleus (replication has occured), it has four major steps involving its protein synthesis. The mRNA will travel into the cytoplasm to be attatched to a tRNA with complimentary bases. Transcription occurs here. The mRNA is being transcribed. Then the tRNA undergoes translation with amino acids. Coded codons are used in this step to create the correct amino acid chain. This step involves other ribosomes to complete the chain. When the chain of amino acids is complete, elongation occurs where there is a stop codon and the sequencing will stop. replicationtranscriptiontranslationelongation

It starts with the mRNA leaving the nucleas delivering a message. Then the gRNA step in, followed by the tRNA, and eventually it ends with the rRNA the final strand.
Four major steps involved in protein synthesis would be the making of new cells, letting out what the cell doesnt need, and the new proteins.
tRNArRNAgRNA mRNA
After copying the DNA sequence, mRNA leaves the nucleus of the cell. The mRNA then heads to a rRNA, where synthesis can begin. The mRNA feeds the code through the rRNA. Based on what three bases you have in each segment, a tRNA will bring that corresponding amino acid. The amino acids form an amino acid chain, which is also called a protein. After the mRNA has gone all the way through, the last amino acid added is the stop amino acid. After this process, all three RNAs have created a protein.
mRNA takes proteins to rRNAsends copies to tRNAdepulicates
The mRNA meats up with at the Golgi aparatis and then rRNA assembels the other side of the mRNA and once that is done the new strand exits the cell.

First mRNA starts by creating a message that Tells the other types of RNA what they will be doing. It creates a blue print for tRNA. tRNA then carries the ammio acids with the anticoden to the rRNA which makes up ribosomes and other proteins.
IT GOES TO tRNA WHICH TAKES IT TO THE MITOCHONDIRA WHERE IT IS TRANSFORMED INTO RNA

The Transfer, the reading of the information, the sending of the proteins, and recieving
When mRNA leavs the nucleus the mRNA must find rhibosomes to tell them how to make protein. When the mRNA finds the rhibosomes the RNA helps them make the protein. One of the major steps is to find out what the mRNA was told to do by the DNA. When the rhibosomes find out what the mRNA has told them they go to work.
it copys over and over to make more protein then
All the DNA's steams are bein put together.
Your ribosomes would store energy and food. It would store enough for them to require enough energy to make protines. First they would gather energy from the organelles and then use RNA to create the protines.
mRNA leaves the nucleus and goes to the tRNA. Then it goes into the golgi bodies and it is made into RNA again.
mRNA is the messenger rna. it sends information to the cells. tRNA is the transfer rna. it transfers cells. rRNA is the messenger rna. gRNA
gathering sun light, processing proteins, dropping unwanted things.
Four major steps after mRNA that invole protein synthesis are, the nucleus and the codons are transferred. They also start translation and transport.
mRNA leaves the nucleus     attaches to DNA      RNA segments in the cytoplasm      they attach to the mRNA using covalent bonding     hydrogen bonds break, split and repeat
The mRNA leaves the nucleus an then goes to the tRNA where it transfers the information, then it goes to the rRNA.
After leaving the nucleus, the mRNA has to carefully make it's way to the site of the tRNA. The next step is translation. This step invloves the tRNA to translate the DNA sequence on the mRNA. The third step is the tRNA making it's way to the ribosomes. This step is very important because this step is the step which almost finishes protein synthesis. The last step is when the ribosomes do what the sequence of the DNA says to do.
1) mRNA leaves the nucleus.2) mRNA travels into the cytoplasm 3) mRNA is translated into tRNA 4)tRNA makes another strand to make another cell.
Goes through the cell membrane. through the cell wall. enters the endoplasma. Then enters the nuclei.
Transcription, DNA is transcribed into mRNA so it can leave the nuclear membrane. The mRNA passes through the nuclear membrane.The mRNA travels on the endoplasmic riticulum to the ribosome.The ribosome reads the mRNA to figure out what type of protein to make.
The mRNA leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm. Then it attaches to a ribosomes. Anti codons with amino acids come and attach themselves to the complemantary mRNA codon then ceate tRNA.
Firstly, the RNA strand travels to the ribosomes. Secondly, the Start codon starts the building of the protein. Thirdly, tRNA comes and builds the protein. Lastly, the Stop codon comes along and ends the production of the protein
The protien strand is readthen duplicatedmatched with another then paired into amino acids
tRNA-transportig it through ribosome.rRNA- helping it through. Making protiens and transporting them away.
replication
sun light, water, oxogen, cells
1. The mRNA unwinds and reveals inner chains.2. New proteins are added and transcription takes place.3. The proteins are reversed of their old proteins (Thymine is now Adine)4.  The mRNA is fixed and winds back up to become a new protein.
It separates then replicates after leaving the nucleus.
mRNA leaves the nucleus, then translates onto tRNA.  The codons in the tRNA each code for a certain type of amino acid.  That amino acid creates the necessary protein.
The mRNA leaves the nucleous and replicates. The replicated mRNA is then paired with a base pair that matches up to the end of the sequence.
The strand for the RNA.The explanations for the RNA.And i dont really know the other two?
1. mRNA arrives and leaves the sequence from the DNA.2. tRNA gives the rest of the sequence.3. The Sequence gets renewed.4. It starts over again.
Transportation-brings the nucleus out Trascription-copies the nucles dnaTranslation-make it a code dna can readTransfusion-travels seperately
mRNA leaves the nucleus, goes to the place where the protein arrives, then goes to the place where proteins gets stored, after that they return to the nucleus and starts all over the next min and does it again.

One major step involed in protein synthesis is when the food enters the cell, the cell breaks it down and seperates the protein and the fatty foods.
tRNA then attaches to the mRNA, matching its bases to those of the mRNA.  The segments formed by the mRNA are called codons.  These codons code for specific amino acids.  The amino acids form a chain on the tRNA, forming a protein.

rRNA then tRNA and DNA
1.  The mRNA leaves the nucleus because the DNA is to big to fit through the nucleaus pores.2.  The mRNA then separates from the DNA side.3.  A new strand of DNA fills in on the old DNA side.4. A new complete strand of DNA is formed
Interphaseanaphaseprophasetelephase
Umm...Copy the strand of RNA .Use bonds the connect the corrasponding nucleotides together.(no clue!)The process starts all over again.
The first step is DNA spliting into two, single strand RNA.  The next step is the RNA leaving the nucleus.  Third, it must find a copy of another RNA to link it with the other.  Finally, the codons are linked and you have a protein.
Translation is where protein language is translated into amino acid language so they can understand it to make new proteins. Transcription is where they are taken from one place to another for protein synthesis. RNA has to fit into holes where DNA cannot to make protein synthesis. The last way is when DNA is made into RNA with mRNA to make new proteins. When it is made into RNA, that is making new proteins.
1-the mRNA travels to a ribosome 2-The codons on the mRNA signal for an amino acid3-Translation-tRNA match up an amino acid to each codon on the mRNA starting with the start codon4-termination-the amino acids are matched up with the codons on the mRNA until the stop codon is reached, which signals the end of translation
Once mRNA leaves the nucleus then tRNA does it's job. After tRNA then the RNA is almost all the way done with producing protein. After two more steps the RNA is done with making the proteins and that is what protein synthesis is.
The mRNA than goes over to the DNA and come together, Than tRNA begins to transfer the data onto the DNA to begin to create proteins, once the DNA gets it it begins to create protein, last when finished the rRNA breaks off and than starts all over.
it goes and get blood cells
The RNA leaves the nucleus and then it goes into the cell membrane. When it is there it then startes to break down and turn into protein. When it is done there the protein then goes throughout the entire cell.

mRNA occurs transfering over to tRNA, while entering the nucleus and dividing into it's own parts of RNA.
Its tells what protiens  to make and it makes it
the four major steps to involved in protein synthesis are
The mRNA matches up with the others.
It then goes through the dna to the rna and out to the trna which transfers it to the cellular membrane.
1. The mRNA goes through the cells and meets the tRNA.2. The tRNA matches up its nucleotides with those of the mRNA.3. The tRNA gives the mRNA an amino acid sequence.4. Steps 2 and 3 are repeated until the tRNA reaches a stop codon at the end of the mRNA sequence.
mRNA will go to a ribisomtRNA will conect to the mRNAthe mRNA will brack away from the ribosomeThe mRNA will fold into complex 3d shapes
After mRNA leaves the nucleus, there are four major steps that go on in order for proteins to function properly.                The mRNA travels from the nucleus to the ribosome where ribosmal RNA is present, also known as rRNA. The rRNA then goes to the nuclues where proteins are stored. Then the amino acids bond and then you have a protein.     That is the complete protein synthesis.
Its made in the ribosomes.The ribosomes carry it through the cell.The ribsome enters the nuclus.The Golgi apperatus takes the waste out of the nucleus and the cell.
Light, photosynthesis, reprodution,
mRNA travels to a tRNA and relays that message. Then the tRNA starts to copy the mRNA so the cell can have a replicate. The new mRNA travels to ribosomes. The ribosomes begin to make the protein.
1. A ribosome attaches to the mRNA (rRNA). Translation Occurs;2. Codons are coded for a specific amino acid.3. Anticodons that are in the tRNA are paired with the codons in the mRNA. 4. Peptide bonds are formed between the amino acids after translation has occured. New proteins are made.
First, transcription takes place where the mRNA is copied. Then, in translation, the RNA has a set of directions that are translated and tell the ribosomes how to make the protein.
mRNA leaves the nucleus.  Next it goes into the golgi aparatus.  Then it starts making amino acids.  After that the ribosomes start making the protein.
The first step of protein synthesis is when mRNA is sent to a new DNA strand.  The mRNA is then attached to the DNA strand.  The tRNA is then sent to the strand and the genetic sequences are transferred.  You then have a new strand of DNA, that is a replicate of the old strand.
tRNA translates the mRNA strand into a polypeptide strand. That polypeptide strand makes up a protein. That protein helps with cell life processes. And the mRNA strand is translated over and over again.
Once mRNA leaves the nucleus, it goes to a mitocondria and by using translation, the information is passes to a tRNA which is then used in making proteins. The codons match up with the anticodons. That then allows the creation of proteins.
Codons come and break the RNA's code down three at a time. Mutations occure. The codon takes that code and makes proteins. Your body uses those proteins.
the mRNA leaves the nucleus then
codons are made on the rna strand.the codons are tranferred to amino acids.the amino acids make proteins.the stop codon is used to stop the production of more amino acids.
After the mRNA leave the nucleus, the
the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it then translates the RNA, form amino acids, and then protien is made,
First mRNA leaves the nucleus with the DNA sequence.  Then the mRNA meets up with the tRNA and the tRNA takes and makes the new strand.  Then the mRNA leaves with the new strand.  The final step is that new proteins are made.
The mRNA takes the RNA to tRNA where they transfer it to DNA and back. Then they take it to dRNA where they do something.
they combine with each other.It makes it harder and more dense.They go evolve into different forms.makes the MRNA  more tense.
mRNA goes to the DNA and makes a copy of the DNA. The mRNA then gives the information to the tRNA which delivers the information to the rRNA. The rRNA then makes the protiens in the ribose of the cell creating new protien.
1. Translation. goes to the tRNA tells it what it needs.2. RNA processing3. The tRNA combines the protien to copy the mRNA brought out of the nuecleous with hydrogen bonds.4. the rRNA takes it out of the cell and places it where it is needed.

Metaphase, prophase, telophase, and anaphase.
With protein synthesis, first the mRNA leaves the nucleus. Then the mRNA duplicates itself. Then it travels back to the nucleus as tRNA and reattaches itself with the mRNA. There is a copied strand and a original strand on each of the now two pairs.

Four major steps involved are: breaking everything down, making sure it travels to the correct place, getting everything else ready, and making everything all over again.
mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels through the cell with the DNA information. The DNA holds the material necessary for making protein. After passing through the cell the material from the DNA is transformed into a protein.
mRNA attaches to dnaDNA sequencingAmino acids are produced
rRNA decrypts mRNAtRNA gets amino acids to make the protien.
they need to go through the process of mRNA, tRNA ,and dna to finish all the process of the mRNA.
1. Brings the mrna to a ribosome to be remade.2. Mrna goes in ribosome on one end.3. tRNA then comes witha codon oposite of the original and places it together4. The tRNA leaves and Mrna moves to next codon needing to me matched by tRNA. The next correct tRNA links onto the last one creating the protein.
mRNA carries instructions from the nucleus for the amino acid sequence of a protein. tRNA takes instructions to the protein.

It sends information from the nerve system to the brain. It takes proteins across the cell membrane. It takes the DNA to the seqence. It also adds peptides to the chain.
When mRNA leaves the nucleus, the four major steps involved in protein synthisis are spliting, copying, forming a new strand, and putting it all back together.
After the mRNA leaves the nucleus, then ribosomes attach to the endoplasmic reticullum. Than it is moved throughout cells to build the protein number back up.

First a strand of dna is formed. Then the stand of dna breaks apart. New dna attaches to both pieces of the dna. Another step involves RNA but that happenes after the other steps have occured.
-mRNA leaves the nucleus and tRNA steps in to translate the sequence-rRNA create ribosomes for the sequence along with realting to amino acids-the sequence is let out of the cell-it goes off into the organism's body
it first starts out when something needs repaired then thats when the dna sends signals to start a recreation of something the body need's so what happens is that MRNA comes into effect then thats when dna creates MRNA that's when MRNA goes to what needs to be fixed and gives it protien to do so. And MRNA is small enough to fit threw the holes thats in a nucleus

Transcription- the mRNA changes form.Duplication- the RNA strand is duplicated and then forms new segments of RNA which code for DNA.Translation- the mRNA meets up at the ribosome and tRNA are produced.
mRNA takes protein to DNA strand coping it and making new
mRNA leaves nucleus Leaves with information on how to make the proteins information is translated proteins are made
mRNA sends a message to protein wich makes them multiply into more protein
After the mRNA leaves the fist step is to go through the cell and deliver the message that is coded in the RNA to the right parts. It first has to transfer the RNA into codons so that the message will be readable to the parts. Next it has to deliver the message to the right place in the cell. It then goes back to recive more messages so that it can transfer the message and start again.
The mRNA leaves the nucleus, and then from there it delivers the message to wherever it is supposed to. Then attaches to the DNA strand.
The mRNA makes another copy of itsself making tRNA.
First, DNA responsible for this unzip, and nitrogen bases pair up with the DNA bases. The mRNA takes this section to tRNA to form codons that can be used in protein synthesis. The codons are matched up with anticodons at ribosomes, and amino acids are made from these. When the amino acids are completed and form the right chain, they are traken and used for their needed purpose.
mRNA gives the information to the tRNA who translates it and shows it to the rRNA, who builds the protein.
1. they have no organism 2. they have no air3. they get no water4. they have no shelter
During protein synthesis the mRNA first leaves the nucleus.  It then goes on to the Golgi Apparatus.  The next step is the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER).  After the mRNA leaves the ER it makes its way to the nucleus.
The mRNA would leave the nucleus and find another piece of RNA to connect with to make a new strand, then it'd go back into the nucleus and then repeat this cycle throughout time.
There is mRNA leaving nucles, then travolin to midocondra, then bracking down, and last it is ready for use.
The four major steps of protein synthesis is anaphase, telophase, prophase, and interphase.
It forms from DNA. Then it forms protiens.
The four major steps of protein synthesis are cell respiration, meiosis, miosis, and cell division.
mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the tRNA, which is also called transport RNA. The tRNA gives the intructions for making the protien.
The four major steps in protein synthesis are prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase.
One the gain energy and the nthey use that energy to build up protein synthesis. It thens to made intop protein and then it goes into protein synthesis.
THE FIRST MAJOR STE
The mRNA leaves the nucleus and travels to the ribosome. There the mRNA then tell the tRNA the code to create the proteins. Then the tRNA starts to make the protiens. And finally the proteins are sent out to do their job.
mrna messages the trna of the new protein, which then transports the protein through the kaleb cycles to be built for a specified reason
One major step with mRNA leaving the nucleus involved in protein synthesis is when RNA carries intructions from nucleus to amino acid. Protien takes the mRNA and uses it on the body, for energy.
First major step is going through the nucleas, the Second major step is golgi apparatus, third major step is rough ERand the fourth major step is going through the mitochondria, the mitochondria packages it and distributes.

it goes to the tRNA and then that goes to a nucleotide which then goes through the membrane or ribosome and it travels towards the end of the membrane or ribosome and finally leaves the cell
Firtst, mRNA leaves the nucleus and attaches iself to a free ribosome. Then, the sequence has amino acids come and are attached by an enzyme to the RNA strand, and after the protein stand has been made the RNA releases itself from the ribosome so the process can be repeated.
The mRNA has to carry the message that protein synthesis should occur. Then the chemicals start going that tell the protein synthesis object to start.Once that starts, it does protein synthesis.Lastly protein synthesis has been done.
Telophase, anaphase, metaphase, and mitosis.
PROTEIN SYNTHESIS IS MADE UP OF FOUR MAJOR STEPS. THE FIRST IS TO RECIEVE A MESSAGE FOR ACTION. THE SECOND IS TO PREPARE TO REACT. THIRDLY YOU SEND THE MESSAGE. FORTHLY YOU ACTUALLY DO WHATEVER IS NEEDED, SUCH AS A MESSAGE SENT TO ANOTHER CELL OR CELL GROUP.

tRNA matches its anticodons with mRNA codons. tRNA gets the corresponding amino acid. Then brings the acid back to the corresponding mRNA.
1. mRNA attatchs itself to a ribosome 2. mRNA discloses the genetic information to the ribosome3. The corresponding nucleotides are put together with the information4. The new chain becomes the new protein
The mRNA leaves the nucleus and enters the cytoplasm.  There, it attaches to a ribosome.  Attatched to the ribosome, rRNA comes and brings different codons for amino acids from the mRNA strand to the tRNA strand.  The ribosome moves down the tRNA strand.  The codons attach to the anticodons of the tRNA strand.  As this occurs, ribosomes are forming a strand that codes for the protein.  When the rRNA brings a stop codon, the process ends and the strand containing the protein brakes off to form the actual amino acid for the cell.
mRNA tRNA and the nucleus work to transfer and translate the codes to genetic information for mutations and genetic traits.
mineral, vitiminm, iron, zinc
First, it takes the instructions from the nucleus for a sequence of amino acid.Second, it brings them back to the ribosomes and starts protein synthesisThird, the ribosomes start to synthesize protein using the instructions.Fourth, they release the proteins after synthesizing them.
First, mRNA leaves the nucleus after being transcribed from half a single strand of DNA. Then the small and large ribosomes come attach to the RNA to translate it. The codons are then translated into a certain amino acid and the small and large ribosomes pull the needed amino acid over and then slide to the next codon. This happens multiple times until there is a long chain of amino acids that make a protein.
Translation, which is when the DNA spilts and forms a RNA strand on the cytoplasm. Transcription, which is when DNA is copied and kept in the nucleus where the process takes place. Transformation, which is when protiens make a double helix strand of DNA. There is also meiosis, which is when two cells are split into four dipliod daughter cells.
Four major steps are that Interphase takes place. This is where the cell completely splits. Then there is rRNA which relays the message to let them know what is happening. There is Anaphase which is where the cell starts to divide. Then there is also Telophase where the cell's nucleotides start to get sent over to the other side of the cell.
It sends messages to the brain.mRNA tells the body to react to anything important.Help maintain the cells.
- it has to be broken down to make the protein sythesis
When mRNA leaves the nucleus, there are four major steps that are involved in protein synthesis. The first step is when the messenger RNA replicates. Then the cell divides into two identical daughter cells that both contain the same sequence of RNA. The cells then divide one last time and four daughter cells are created.
1. Prophase- The mRNA is prepared for interphase2. Interphase- The mRNA in torn apart3. Anaphase- The strands are pulled together at the center of the cell4. Telophase- Two new daughter RNA molecules are formed

prophase, metaphase, telophase, anaphase
mrna turns into trna when it goes to the Rough ER, and then gets the proper enzymes and goes back to the nucleus to be paired up with the DNA and replace the Rna stand need to be replaced.
One step is that the cells in mRNA are copied.Another step is once the mRNA leaves the nucleus it turns to RNA.A third step is the RNA changes its sugar to Ribose.
It attaches on to amino acids
FIRST THE mRNA HAS TO TRAVEL TO THE OTHER END OF THE BODY. THEN IT HAS TO FIGHT OFF THE EVIL SPACE INVADERS FROM THE PLANET CORTEX. AFTER THAT IS DONE IT GOES BACK TO IT'S APARTMENT I THE VRAIN AND CALCULATES HOW LONG IT WILL TAKE TO SPLIT A PROTEIN IN HALF. THEN THERE IS A NINJA FIGHT SCENE BETWEEN THE mRNA AND A PROTEIN WHICH ENDS BY THE mRNA KARATE CHOPPING THE PROTEIN IN HALF AND THAT IS HOW PROTEIN SYNTHESIS IS DONE.
1.) When mRNA leaves the nucleus it goes to the tRNA to deliever a message. 2.) When the mRNA gets to the tRNA it delievers the message that it needs to the tRNA needs to carry the instructions from the nucleus for the amino acid sequence of the protein.3.) Then when the tRNA delievers that information the rRNA will take over and put the amino acids in sequence  4.) Then the tRNA will deliver the protein where it needs to go.
The four major steps are that the mRNA leaves the nucleus carrying information to make protein.  The mRNA lands on the rRNA and waits for the tRNA to bring amino acids.  The tRNA brings the amino acids which the mRNA lines up to make a complete protein.
After mRNA leaves the nucleus, the mRNA will go to a ribosome.  After the mRNA is at the ribosome, it will enter the ribosome.  After the mRNA has entered the ribosome, it will share the genetic information it is carrying with the tRNA.  After the tRNA has the genetic information, the tRNA will start bringing in amino acids to great proteins.
mRNA takes it to the brain. Brain takes it in.The brain sends out organisms to fight it.The fighters destroy it.
The mRNA is the taken to be used by tRNA and mRNA. Then it is lined in rows of codons. Then the tRNA and mRNA form together to read and transfer the message for mRNA message. This is all otherwise known as Translation.
1) mRNA leaves nucleus through a nuclear pore2) tRNA comes carrying the complementary codon and amino         acid3) As the tRNA creates amino acids, rRNA moves along the            strand after each amino acid is complete. After a new amino        acid is created, it binds to the previous one, forming a peptide      bond4) When the tRNA encounters a stop codon, the amino acid            chain is complete
Then the mRNA goes to the lysosomes to produce proteins for the cell to use.

The four major steps involved in protein synthesis are the stages of mitosis. Prophase, Metaphase, Anaphase, and Telophase.In the process of mitosis, the cell parts work together to move to the edges of the cell, pull apart, divide, and start all over as daughter cells.

When mRNA leaves the nucleus it goes through many stages.It passes through the mitochondria...it turns it into an ATP.
The first step is mRNA leaving the nucleus. Then, the coded instructions for creating proteins are translated to tRNA. Next, amino acids are produced to make the protein. Finally, the amino acids are combined to make the protein coded for by the mRNA from the nucleus.
The four major steps involved in protein synthesis are gathering the proteins, sortting them, packing them, and sending them out.

mRNA gose to the binding site with the insturtctions for building the protien. Then tRNA takes that over to the chromomes and they corss over.
When the first step of the mRNA has left the nucleus , the second step of this is when the mitochondria takes all the proteins in the body and packages them up and ships them somewhere else. Then the lysosomes take the protein and keep them with other proteins that have been packaged.
the mRNA has to chang into tRNA then tRNA has to change to rRNA then the codons are decoded and changed in to aminoacids.
After the mRNA leaves the nucleus, the tRNA begins to transfer the information to the rRNA to begin to make a new strand, and then it goes in and looks for any missing parts or if the letters got switched around to fix it.

The mRNA copies the DNA, then it seperates, and an amino acid goes through. The last step is that it comes back together.
After mRNA leaves the nucleus it tells the transport RNA to bring nucleotides to the active site for synthesis.  Proteins and amino acids are also brought to the active site.  The messenger RNA tells the existing proteins how to make the neccessary new protein and synthesis begins. ATP is synthesised and provides energy for the reaction.  The protein is then finished and the messenger RNA notifies the nucleus of the completion.
the mRNA leaves the nucleus and goes to the mitochondria.
then you get tRNA then DNA
Protein is transferred.Protein is given a more higher level of itself. makes it stronger.Protein then makes its way to the RNA to keep healthy.
They go through transcription. The dna splits into to so it unwinds its self and splits. Now its mRNA and it has to split to fit through the passage way out of the nucleus. Then it foes down into the ribosomes. Here it uses translation and copies itsleft into dna again and makes protines. The mRNA carries intructions for DNA.
As mRNA leaves the nucleus, it sends it to the tRNA to get transfered onto the RNA sequence and be seperated into codons and read into amino acids. The rRNA does the reading and after it is read, sends these codes of sequences into a polypeptide chain to then be transfered back into the DNA sequence.
mRNA translates the Dna Adn then slides pass the dna on to the Rna delivering the coded information needed
1. mRNA meets with rRNA.2. tRNA brings codes for amino acids and brings them to the site of synthesis.3. rRNA reads mRNA and codes for the amino acids needed. 4. An amino acid chain forms
The mRNA enters the ribosome.Start codon enters P site, second codon at A site.tRNA adds a amino acid to the codon at the P site and A site.The P site codon breaks apart and the codon at the A site takes its place and the process continues until you hit a stop codon, the chain of amino acids creates a protein.
mRNA leases the nucleus and signals certain pathways which then signal for cerain ribosomes to release and help synthesize proteins. rRNA then codes for tRNA to transfers certain ribosomes to the receptors for the creation of proteins.
mRNA leave the nucleus and goes to where ever it has to dump the stuff that it has then it goes back to the nucleus to get more.
It conjoines with another DNA and starts the process of mitosis and then it seperated and breakes off to go make more and replicate.
The mitochondian breaks down the protiens. Then it is filtered through the body and into the blood. The protiens are used to supply energy to the body.
anaphase telephase prophase metaphase
mRNA goes into the cytoplasm to the ribosomes.The mRNA is copied and can become tRNA.The tRNA is made into a copyable strand of DNA.The DNA is taken back to the nucleus,
The mRNA takes the proteins. Then goes to another cell and transfers the protein to that cell. Then it rides to the nucleus and dumps off the information it is carrying. Then it dies.
The mRNA leaves the DNA and finds a ribisom there it is copied and reproduced.
1. Prophase2. Interphase3. Anaphase4. Metaphase
1. The mRNA attaches to a DNA sequence 2. That DNA sequence seperates3. Codons attach to the two new DNA strands and match them identical4. The two new strands are checked over to insure there were no wrongly placed codons

1. find anything that shouldnt be there for ex. germs, bacteria, etc. 2. report it to proteins3. they get rid of bacteria
It protects, strengthens, distributes, and stores proteins to make them more effective and last longer.
THE PROTIEN IS TRANSFERD
mRNA attatches to a ribosome then the ribosome makes the protein its told to make. After that the protien is sent to the Rough E.R. then after that it is altered a little bit and sent out to the Golgi Apparatus. Then the Golgi Apparatussends the protien to where it has to go and then the protien starts doing its job.
mRNA delivering the instructions to the DNA. Then the DNA makes protiens.
The mRNA leaves the nucleus with the instructions for the amino acid sequence of a protein. It then transfers the instructions to the tRNA to start the sequence. With the information it has it makes the sequence until it gets the codone to stop.
The four major steps are one they find the main good cells that are good to reproduce other good cells. Second they go into anapahase to make the process of making proteins faster. Third is that when they are done with anaphase they go inside of each others cells and start making proteins inside them. Fourth is that the protein comes out and there is a good protein that just got made.
1.mRNA start a process called translation2.tRNA bring Adenine, uracil, cytosine, and guanine to the site3.The bases are attached to the mRNA creating a nucleotide4.The nucleotides are folded into their proper shape.
First, mRNA leaves the nucleus to go to get copied. While getting copied they split in half and those halves get identical matchers. Now there is two sets of the same protien. These protien go back to the cells, where they are used, then will start the process all over agian.
The mRNA gives the information to the tRNA. The tRNA then translate the information for the rRNA. The rRNA translates the information once again. Then the rRNA Has the Amino acid which is given back to the nucleus.
The mRNA brings instructions to the amino acids. The rRNA carries out the instruction with the amino acids. Proteins are then created. The tRNA transfers the protein back into the cell through the membrane.
os it the answer  is DNA
1) goes through a pore2) meets with transfer RNA3) connets with a ribosome4) returns to the nucleus
translation transcriptionreplication
It makes a copy of its self like for a new strand, because they do have one strand. and dcopy, and find the ones that match it, because there is no longer anymore thymine, because thymine turns into urical. And I dont remember the rest... sorry):
the mRNA goes to the DNA and uses the tRNA to transfer the genetic code to the DNA so that it could be passed on by sexual reproduction in the sex organs or maybe even just to make more DNA cells
mRNA delivers the plans for the construction of RNA. tRNA brings the various materials for the construction of RNA. rRNA produces RNA. RNA goes out of the ribosome.
It decreases.
transcription-translation-
The four major steps are the mRNA traveling around, the other organelles will work together, they will then try to do something that helps the cell, and then the protein will synthesize.
The mRNA the transports information, then gains a new half to become DNA. Then it copies itself again. Afterwords it transports the information to genes.
It enters the nucleus.It lines up across the center of the nucleus.It seperates.It then begins protein synthesis.
After the mRNA leaves it goes to the ribosome and the tRNA brings amino acids to the mRNA.
1. it leaves2. it travels3. it asks for directions4. it arrives
sends messages to the brain.gives out informationtells cells what to dodelivers to its destination
mRNA is then transferred onto tRNA which makes a complimentary strand then tRNA moves into the protein making organelle where the codons are then turned into amino acids which creates proteins.
1. mRNA transfers the message2. something packages it3. something receives it4. the task is done
The creation, developing the protein, and sending it out of the nucleus
1.ribosomes will translate mrna into protiens.2.then protiens go through the Krebs cycle3.then the protiens are changed into atp4.electron chain transporter takes the atp somewhere ,where the atp will be used.
the RNA controls everything
Instuctions come form the nucleas and with amino acids go to build protein with help from the mRNA
mRNA leaves the nucleus then activly transported across the cell.Next the mRNA is taken to an amino acid and given energy.The mRNA then enters the mitochondria where it is transformed into a protein. This happens because of ribosomes acting on the mRNA.
The four major steps are1: sending the mRNA to the cytoplasm2: the RNA getting copied to make DNA3: mRNA gets sorted to make different body parts4: the RNA does to the amino acids
1) mRNA leaves the nucleus to find the Golgi apparatus out in the cell's cytoplasm.2) Once the Golgi apparatus has the orders from the mRNA to build a new protein, it starts.3) The newly formed protein exits the Golgi apparatus and floats freely in the cytoplasm.4) The protein is picked up and then put to work throughout the cell, usually in the membrane.

in the protein synthesis it goies into different steps to be fully developed. the protein has to get every where in the cell body. it translocates
First, the DNA has to break apart into seperate strands for the mRNA to copy the DNA's information.  Then, the mRNA will begin to copy the DNA.  A will become U, T will become A, C will become G, and G will become C. After the mRNA has copied the information, it will break from the DNA and send the information off to the nucleus. DNA will rejoin into the double helix once more.
The messenger RNA send the message throught the cell.anaphase interphasprophasemetaphase     Proteins are made up of amino acids that are made up of DNA.
1.mRNA leaves the nucleus2.It carries it to the ribosomes3.tRNA then  transfers the sequence 4.Then amino acids then split into separate proteins.
mRNA leaves the nucleus of the cell to begin protein synthesis. From the nucleus the first step includes the mRNA attatching to the rough endoplasmic reticulum in the form of ribosomes. The second step is for the mRNA to be copied to tRNA. tRNA is a complimentary copy to mRNA. The third step,the tRNA is copied into a complimentary rRNA.The codons are read and ready for synthesis. The fourth step includes the assembly of the protein, beginning with a start amino acid and ending with a stop amino acid.
After the mRNA leaves the cell nucleus it goes to the rRNA. once the rRNA has the information it will start making protiens and their codons. After codons and proteins are made the cell now has new DNA.
interphase anaphase metaphase telephase
Code attaches to chromosome. The chromosome sends message to DNA
1. it leaves the nucleus 2. travels out through the cell 3. it transfers to tRNA 4. moves back to the nucleus
When the mRNA leaves the nucleus it goes through two cells. Then the tRNA comes and make matches with the floting letters. From there the amino acids are created and they make a peptide bond and the strand goes away to become DNA.
mRNA leaves the nuclease and finds a protein. Then tRNA makes a copy of the mRna and sends it out into the cell.
1. mRNA floats to a ribosome (rRNA) in the cytoplasm and reads three bases (codon)2. tRNA matches up with proper amino acids and then pulls its amino acids to the ribosome and lines up its anitcodons with the codons3. RNA moves forward and realeases three bases at a time and the tRNA then realeases its amino acids and drifts away.4. The amino acids bond (peptide bond) and form a chain of amino acids which is now a protein. the protein then goes and does its job in the body.
1. The mRNA sends a message to tell the body what protein to make.2. The body makes the protein
There are four major steps involved in protein synthesis: the creation of mRNA, the creation of the protein, the polishing of the protein, and packaging of the protein.  The first step, the creation of mRNA, takes placei n the nucleus.  The nucleus has many extra nitrogenous bases (adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, and uracil) floating around in the nucleic cytoplasm.  It uses adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and uracil (U) to make mRNA.  First, the DNA unravels to the section needed to make the specific protein.  Then, the tRNA reads the DNA, creating the mRNA by matching up the A, C, G, and T(thymine) on the DNA, with the U, G, C, and A on the mRNA, respectively.The second step, the creation of the protein, takes place in the cytoplasm, on a ribosome.  The rRNA in the ribosome reads the mRNA to decide what amino acids to use.  The mRNA consists of codons, sets of three nitrogenous bases, which correspond to a specific amino acid.  The ribosome creates a long amino acid chain, known as a polypeptide chain.The third step, the polishing of the protein, takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).  After the polypeptide chain floats over to the ER, the ER puts the finishing touches on the chain.The fourth step, the packaging of the protein, takes place in the Golgi apparatus.  The Golgi apparatus packages the protein to get it ready to travel to its location out of the cell.  Then, the protein is sent to the part of the body where it's needed.
mRNAtRNArRNAgRNA
The first major step is intersphase which get the body started.  Then there is metaphase which brings in the nurtients.  Next is anaphase which seperates the nutrients.  Lastly theres propshase which uses up all the proteins and completes the process.
After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it attaches to a ribosome. The mRNA contains a codon that will bind with a specific anticodon. Transfer RNA carries that specific anticodon to the codon on the mRNA. The codon and anticodon bind, and form an amino acid. More and more tRNA molecules bring anticodons to the mRNA codons, which produce a growing polypeptide chain. This chain will be a protein.

the bosy have to boned together ti make sure that it kill off the bad things
When the mRNA leaves the nucleus, the codons move down one place, then another codon comes on the end and that is called the stop codon. After that, the process starts again.
1. finding the protiens2.
The mRNA goes RRNA and gives them instruvtions from DNA for the amino acid sequence . Ribosomal RNA makes the ribosomes. TRNA puts the proteins into order to match them up with their correct codon. Prpteins match up with the correct codon, which makes the identical sequence to what DNA needs.
1: The mRNA send information to the rRNA to tell it to make amino acids.2: The rRNA makes the amino acids.3: The amino acids are then made into RNA by tRNA4: Then the DNA and RNA com together.
The mRNA finds a DNA strand.It attaches to the strand.It begins to copy the protiens.It takes the copies back to the cell.

After mRNA the protine begeins ti divide then it follows the DNA blueprint to construct a new protien, then the prosses repetes it self.
Interphase, Telophase, Prophase, and Anaphase.
1. First it tells what is happening to the Golgi Apparatus2.It goes to mRNA to try and find the protein synthisis
mRNA leaves the nucleus to collect data and brings it back into the cell. After that, the DNA is replicated. Following this step, the tRNA transfers the DNA onto the replication. Ribosomes hold the replica into place as it transfers.

Protein Synthesis:1) The proteins find a mate.2) The proteins reproduce to make more proteins.3) Then the proteins spread out.4) And make more.
mRNA leaves the nucleus.It transfers all of the protien-making instructions to the other parts of the body.
mRNA, tRNA, rRNA
The protein is copied by the rRNA, then it is transcribed by the tRNA, The the mRNA takes the trancribes copy to the amino acid sequence of a protein. Then the body makes a new starnd of RNA.
mRNA leaves the nucleusmRNA transfers the nucleic sequence to the tRNAit is then paired with the opposite nucleic materialsthen its 'copied and pasted'
mRNA tranfers to tRNA, and that tranfers to rRNA, which transfers to gRNA.
The other strand will repeat the process and replicate into another strand of mRNA and continue the process over and over again.
It goes through the cytoplasm then into the cell membrane.  After that it goes through a process and then it goes out of the cell.
MESSANGER RNA TO ENDOPLACIUM RETICULUM TO RIBOSOMES THEN ATTACHES TO WALL

4 major steps are
the cell cycle
One step is when the mRNA goes out of the nucleus. Another step is the mRNA travels through ribosomes. The next step is the mRNA gets its second strand. The final step is the mRNA is now a complete chromosome
1. interphase lead to metaphase were the cell starts to copy cell anaphase brings the cytopasma and spindle to form new copies prophase spites the cell into new dauter cells
1. Reproduction2. Crossing-over3.Replication4. Becoming a new cell
Four major steps are crossing over, movement, mitosis, and meiosis.
The ribosome comes to the mRNA strand.  Then two rRNA molecules start to decode the strand.  As it decodes a protien is produced on the outside of the ribosome.  When it reaches the stop codon the protien is finished and the ribosome leaves the mRNA strand.
First is translation to become mRNA. Then it will leave the cell and go to first a ribosome then to a mitochondria. The mitochondria will then form the mRNA into a protein.
STEP 1 :   THE FIRST STEP IS THE BODIE GOES DIFFUSION THEN THE BODIE GETS RID OF THE EXTRA STRAND THEN I NEW STRAND UNZIPS THEN TURNS INTO A GOLDGI BODIE
it then goes to the ribosomes. codons then match the anticodons brought by the tRNA every anticodon brings with it an amino asid that corresponds with the secuance of the nitrogonous bases.the amino acid is made and once the stop codon is pus on,the protein goes.
One would be ER that attach to ribsomes which produce proteins and proteins help your body.

First, mRNA leaves the nucleus. After that, the mRNA develops into a sequence, by which we call a codon, after the codon is made the sequence is made into amino acids. After the amino acids are made, proteins are made.
mRNA leaves the nucleus and goes to rRNA, rRNA then makes replicas of the DNA and tRNA takes it to the organells to follow the instructions
Four major steps involved in protein synthesis is
The mRNA goes to the cytoplasm to look for a ribosome.     The mRNA is then read by the rRNA.     The rRNA tells the tRNA witch amino acid to bring.      The tRNA brings the amino acids to the ribosome where the amino acids will be assembled into proteins.
The first major step is transcription of mRNA.
The mRNA leaves the nucleus.The mRNA tells the stuff where to go.It goes there.The stuff gets there.

the four major steps involved in protein synthesis are the collecting of proteins, assortment of sugers, copying of protein, and the organization of the new protein.
It goes through the chain and then goes throuth the atp synthase then it comes out of the transport chain
-leaves the neucleus--attaches itself to a ribosome---reaches mitochondrion----begins protein synthesis
DESISES
After the mRNA leaves the nucles it goes through four major steps involved with protein synthesis. Firts it goes through transcription and is changed into DNA.
transfering information to the cell.getting rid of all the bad proteins.Gathering good protein.Putting it in a certain place in the cell.
First, the tRNA carries the mRNA from the nucleus to the lysosomes. Then the lysosomes follow the instructions on the mRNA to make amino acids. After the amino acids are made, they form together to form a protein. The the protein is released into the endoplasmic reticulum and the process starts all over again.
First, the mRNA is released into the body. Then the mRNA attaches itself to ribosomes. Thirdly, the mRNA grows to the biggest size in can go. Lastly, when the mRNA is done growing, it will be delivered to the lysosome where it will be disposed of.
interphasemetaphaseprophaseanaphase
starting with mrna, it reads the bonds like instructions, then sends this to the nuclesous to get transfered into the second strain. After that it is transfered to the RNA strain, which is turned into the last form. Then is Hocked to the hydroxide bonds.
messager RNA leaves the nucleus and gives the cells the message of what amino acids that they code for.Then the codons gather together and make the correct codons. It leaves and goes back to the nuclueus and creates the correct proteins with the codons it has.
1: mRNA leaves2: oxygen enters3: water enters4: protein is synthesised
After mRNA leaves the nucleus, after going through the process of trancription where the RNA polymerase unzip the strand into two identical halves, the mRNA goes to the ribosome. Translation occurs when tRNA makes a copy of the DNA segment and complementary base pairs are linked to the half of the mRNA strand. The complementary base pairs start to link onto the mRNA strand only when the start codon is identify and complemented. Then the tRNA brings amino acids and builds the amino acids onto the molecule making a protein chain. Finally the base pairs hit the stop codon and translation has completed the new mRNA strand.
mRNA changes to tRNA and travels through the Golgi Apparatus. then goes to the lysosome where it is translated and amino acids are then put into packages and sent off as protiens
mRNA tRNA rRNA
the mitochondria absorbs the sun light to create food. the food(lysosomes) is sent to the endoplasmic reticuilum to create the protiens then the waste from the endoplasmic reticulum is sent to the golgi apparatus to get wasted.
The a,c,g,u is a thing that has RNA for the telephase.
The mRNA leaves the nucleus, then the mRNA goes to the ribosomes.  The mRNA is then translated into DNA.  The DNA makes a strand of proteins.

The proteins are leaving the cell.
tRNA    rRNAgRNAmRNA
The mRNA then goes to the ribosomes.  From the ribosomes it goes to the ER.  Then the ER takes it to the cell membrane and then it goes throught the cell membrane out into the body.
Prophase: New cell is formed    Metaphase: sister chromatids line up in the middle of the cell    Anaphase: cell starts to divide     Telephase: cell divides and reproduces
mRNA leaves nucleus.mRNA is decoded and transported by the tRNAAmino acid is formedProtein is made
The first step is that the protien unzips the mRNA. The next step is that it takes out any kind of trash that it may have. Next the protien comes back and Zips it back up. The last step is that it sends it back from the nucleus to the cytoplasm.
When mRNA leaves the nucleus it travels 1st to the mitocondria. Then it goes to the flagellums. After that it goes to be bonded with amino acids and lastly it is changed into protein.
The mRNA gets transformed into another type of RNA. That new RNA is use to make genetic information. That strand of genetic information gets a complementary strand. Both of the strands get paired up and they make a segment of DNA.
glyklous
The mRNA hookes up to the DNA to make a protein. It then distconect from the DNA. After that it goes to make a tRNA. Finally it starts offer.
The mRNA gives information to the nucleus.  The protein is formed from this information.
1. Interphase        2. Prophase3.Anaphase4.Metaphase
The first step is the mRNA going to the ribosome. The mRNA is then turned to tRNA after going through transcription. After translation, the tRNA is turned into codons which code for amino acids.

mRNA turns into Dna
1. the mRNA leaves the nucleus and searches for a ribosome2. the mRNA finds a ribosome and attaches to it3. the mRNA is decoded by tRNA via base pairing rules and the amino acids, previously synthesized, are brought in as indicated by the mRNA.4. the ribosome moves on down the mRNA strand, assembling the amino acids in the correct order.
the mRNA moves across th cytoplasm.then it gets the the cytoplasm were it reads the mRNA to make a copy of itthe copy is make to tRNA to make amino acid.then the ribosome makes the amino acid to make protein
1. The mRNA goes to a ribosome where protein synthesis will occur.2. The mRNA is read to produce anticodons.3. tRNA brings the anticodons to the ribosome. Each codon codes for a specific amino acid.4. The codons go together to form a polypeptide chain(the protein).
ribosomes link proteins together to make a protein chain
1. the mRna unzips 2. the mRna changes thymine into uracil3.the mRna changes its structure 4.the mRna zips back up
The four major steps are DNA, proteins, ribrosomes, and lysomoes. The proteins are part of the process and the ribrosomes are what helps it too leave the nucleus. The Lysomoes are what helps to keep it in the nucleus.
mRNA GIVES IT TO RNA.  RNA MAKES THE PROTEINS.
After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it goes out into the cytoplasm on a ribosome. The ribosome attaches and reads until it sees the codon AUG. Once it sees this codon, it starts pairing the bases with complementary anticodons on the tRNA. The tRNA brings amino acids that link together to form a protein. This process terminates at a stop codon.
It starts with mRNA, then goes to tRNA, then gRNA, and finally rRNA.
four major steps that are involved with protein sythesis are prophase, metaphase,interphase,and annaphase.
mrna trna rrna
Theres mRNA which is messenger RNA. Then theres tRNA which is transfer RNA. These work to send DNA and such in different places. Theres also rRNA which is recieve RNA. they recieve and take care of whats sent by mRNA and TRNA.
As the mRna goes out from the nucleus and tells the trna what amino acid to get. Trna goes to find amino acids that will match the RNA sequence. Then the trna gets the amino acids and finds the matching codon  on the rna sequence strand adn pairs with it.This creats an amino acid sequence that tells the cell how to make a protien.
it moves to other side. they all connect. the help the body. it moves everything
The mRNA transports messages to the brain. The DNA strand recieves the message.
The mRNA leaves the nucleus then it goes to the DNA and transmitts a message and then it will read it and do what it tell it to do.
TRNA RNA
Prophase anapase metaphase and telophase are the four.
The mRNA carries instructions for the amino acid sequence for the proteins.
G1-Proteins head to where they have to go.Interphase-Proteins reach destination.G2-Proteins seek out problem.G3-Proteins work and fix the problem.
mRNA is the meesanger RNA. It carries the information out of the cell to the ribosome. Which then takes that information to the protien. Then once it gets to the protien, the protiens starts to go through protien synthesis.

The first step in protein synthesis is mRNA leaving the nucleus.The second step in protein synthesis is it going into the blood stream.The third step in protein synthesis is the mRNA transfering into DNA. The last step of potein synthesis is it leaving the body.
During mRNA, it leaves the nucleus and goes into the blood stream. Once it is in the blood stream, it goes through and goes to the mitochondria where the sister cells replicate. After they replicate one set of the genetic information goes back into the blood stream. Then it goes to the brain. This action is completed in just seconds.
Anaphase, Metaphase, Prophase, and Telophase.
The mRNA tells some other RNA to make some protein.  So that RNA goes somewhere else.  Then at that place it makes some protein.  The protein leaves when it is made.
tRNA carries instructions from the nucleus to the amino acid sequence of the protein.
It gives the other organelles food.It helps protect the body.It will defend anything and traps anything and turn it into food and energy.

mRNA leaves the nucleus, then tRNA  replaces he mRNA and then that travels around and is involved in a process known as protein synthesis.
1. The mRNA carries the information to the nucleus
The RNA will break off and attach a new strand onto the tRNA
1. mRna leaves nucleus.2. mRna goes through the ET to make proteins. 3. Codons are made according to the codons on the mRna.4. Goes to the Golgi Apparatus.
The major step involved in protein synthesis are that the proteins cycle through the body and give it all of the protein and nutrients that it needs.
Starting with mRNA leaving the nucleus one step involved in protein synthesis would be speclization.
Protein leaves the nuclues. It gets synthesized. It goes back to nucleus. The nucleus responds and uses it.
ENZYME
golgi apparus which store and packages proteins,
When translation begins, the mRNA goes with a ribosome and attaches itself to a start codon. It then goes with a ribosome to start adding the anticodons to the codons added on to the genetic code; the anticodons are added by the tRNA. The tRNA attaches to the P site first then moves to the A site when the it attaches an amino acid to the amino acid chain, then this process continues until a stop codon is reached. The result is the newly created protein.
anaphase prophase metaphase telophase
The mRNA leaves the nucleus, then the DNA produces tRNA, then the tRNA makes proteins, and the tRNA transports the proteins.
mRNAtRNArRNARNA
1. The mRNA goes into the cytoplasm and finds a ribosmome .2. The mRNA has the code and the tRNA gets this code, and finds the amino acid that matches this code. 3. The rRNA acts as a holding device while this is going on. 4. The tRNA brings back the amino acid to the ribosome where the protein is made because amino acids are the monomer of proteins.
1. The mRNA makes new protein 2. It starts the process of making a new protein strand3. It finds which protein it needs for the strand4. A new protein is formed
When mRNA leaves the nucleus, it goes to into the Endoplasmic Reticulum.  It travels through the Endoplasmic Reticulum to the Golgi Apparatus.  There, the Golgi Apparatus decides where the mRNA should go, and then sends it to the ribosomes.  When the mRNA arrives at the nucleus, it is made into a protein.
1.tRNA takes the stuff from the nucleus to where it needs to go2.3.4.
1.New proteins are made.2.The protein is sent throughout the cell.3.Protein is sent out of the cell.4.Cycle starts all over again.
The mRNA goes to a ribosome. Then tRNA come and attach themselves to the mRNA. The DNA is replicated. Then they unzip and there are two DNA strands.
mRNA leaves the nucleus with amino acid sequence to the ribosomes. From there, the information is taken by tRNA to the mitochondrion where a new protein is formed.
mRNA has to get settled in somewhere and be able to function. Then it gets more sugars to multiply the strands. mRNA then has to go through mitosis, and last it creates proteins.
It carries instructions from the nucleus containing information about the sequence of amino acids of a protein.
it conects to the DNA and makes mRNA, the mRNA than takes messages to other parts of the cell, it goes through the nucleus, through the cell membrane, and than off to the other parts of the cell.
Protien synthesis has four major steps, mRNA, moves the protein, tRNA allows for the protein th tanscribe, rRNA creates the DNA in the RNA, gRNA moves it into the cell
The first step for mRNA leaving the nucleus is that it heads to a protein, it goes to a protein so it can attach itself. The second step is the mRNA puts in information from the nuclues, this helps so that the proteins can get messages to do things so that it can do what the nucleus needs it to do. Then the protein will start to create new proteins, so that the cell can survive, this will help so that the cell will be healthy and can do more tasks. The final step is the mRNA leaves the protein and goes back to the nucleus, so that the mRNA can go to another cell. This process helps so that there are more proteins in the cell, and then it can create more energy. This also carries amino acid sequences to the proteins so they can produce, or use them for energy.
the protein begins to synthesizeit makes new onesit makes some kind of foodi have no clue
1. the mRNA leavcs the nucleus2. It goes to the tRNA and reproduces3. From the reproduction there are more cells now4. the cells attaches on to another strand and starts the cycle again.
After leaving the nucleus the mRNA goes to the tRNA and is decoded and an amino acid is made from each codon. Then the amino acids connect to make a protein stand.
The mRNA
IT ENVOLVES ALOT
Once mRNA leaves the nucleus RNA transcription occurs.  Then RNA translation occurs.  After this DNA can be made so DNA replication occurs.  Then proteins combine with nucleic acids to make DNA sequences for the new DNA.
The synthesis will start to pull apart then it will split into two. It will then pull apart than start all over again.

It is the mRNA and it is the huge major steps and they need to go and have a lot of the synthesis.
it leaves and goes to the ribisonoes, making protine for the body to use
when the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it connects with proteins, and then it coneects with high energy and it goes around the cell. After that it connects with amino acids.
First, the mRNA takes the genetic code to the tRNA.  Then the mRNA attaches itself to the tRNA.  Next, the mRNA inscribes the code into the tRNA.  Finally, the mRNA releases itself and goes back to recieve more of the code.

It comes in contact with another nucleus.
The mRNA leaves the nucleus and it transferred to the ribosome.After the mRNA arrives copies begin being made in the ribosome.After the copies are made they are sent out of the ribosomes and can be used for just about anything.But they can also be transferred back to the nucleus to be used for reproduction.
mRNA goes and delivers the message of DNA. The DNA is then decoded. The decoded DNA is then split. The split DNA is then put together with another strand of DNA.
mRNA and protein syntheses are the main part.
The mRNA transforms They show up evolve with othersThe mRNA idk
mRNA transfers the sequences of amino acids to tRNA.  From tRNA it is translated back to DNA for a new protein to be created.  At this point the daughter DNA sequence is sent to the golgi apparatus where it is 'packaged' and sent out to perform it's assigned function.
mRNA leaves the nucleus for the ameno acids then it transfers to tRNA and is transformed to protein

it goes to all the other RNA.
The mRNA is also known as the messenger RNA. It takes the message of the old codon sequence and copys it down into the new sequence and sends it as a message to the tRNA also known as the transfer RNA. The tRNA transfers the new code to the right sequence. Then, the rRNA (also known as the receiving RNA) receives the new sequence and puts it into use so that it will do it's job.
TranslationTranscriptionreplication
Protien synthesis begins with the cytoplasm going toward the ribosome.
mRNA is when the cell goes to the ribosomes and tells them that they need proteins.Then tRNA=Transfer RNA transfers the proteins to the spot that the area is low on proteins.Then rRNA helps the proteins get there.Then gRNA helps the cycle be repeated again.

GuanineThymineCitosoneAdnine
mRNA takes it to tRNA which then takes it to the the rRNA that reads it and decodes it to get the message.
The messanger RNA takes the message from the DNA and takes it to the Nuclues and connects to make chromosomes
After the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it goes to the ribosomes to leave the cell. Once the ribosomes leave the cell through the cell membrane that is dissappearing, it goes and attaches itself to the codon strand. Once at the strand, it copies the data that will then be sent to get the anticodon strand to match up and make a protein.
After the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it will turn into tRNA. This tRNA will then continue towards the mitochondria. After it reaches the protein, the message from the RNA will tell the mitochondria how and what kind of protein is needed. Then this will form a link of amino acids to form the protein needed.
Beginning with mRNA Then becoming tRNAThen codingFinally the cell knows what to code for the proteins
After mRNA leaves the nucleus, tRNA transfers the proteins to the ER. After this rRNA takes it from the ribosome and then the protein is sent it off into the cell.
mrna leaves the nucleus wth the instruction to bulid a protien.
mRNA goes to the ribosome to get attached to an amino acid
1. The mRNA leaves the nucleus.2. The mRNA finds the ribosome.3. The amino acids that mach the genitic sequences on the mRNA come down and attach themselves to eachother.4.The amino acids form a protein after all of them have been attached.
The mRNA goes to the mitochondrion and tells the transfer rna what to do. The tRNA then goes and gets what is needed and brings it to the cell. The rRNA finishes off the RNA sequence with the missing piece(s) that the tRNA brought.
the four major steps involed in protein synthesis are carbohydrates, amino acids, fat, sugar

Transcription-DNA-Translation-RNA
Anaphase,intrphase,metaphase,and prophase are the four steps needed to for the synthesis.
When mRNA leaves the nucleus, tRNA transfers information to the nucleus and translation occurs. The amino acids are then read and are distributed. Transcription splits the amino acids and rRNA makes the new protein.
mRNA leaves the nucleus.
The mRNA leaves the nucleus and goes to the ribosomes and turns into tRNA and that goes and makes a polypeptide chain which is also known as an amino acid and the amino acids put together make proteins.
Step.1) The mRNA leaves the nucleusStep 2) The mRNA then Finds another strand of mRNA     Step 3) The mRNA Combines with the other strand of mRNAStep 4) DNA is formed
mRNA leaves the nucleus travels into the gogi body out the anus into the enviroment
Entering - mRNA enters the area surrounding the nucleus in order to find a spot to form in.Code creation - the mRNA, along with the gRNA, tRNA, and rRNA, goes to work to manipulate to form an amino acid sequence.Code instruction - mRNA gives code instructions for the amino acid sequence in the protein.Protein formation - the protein forms from the mRNA strand, with code instructions.
1.) Anaphase: the parent cell is going through a process of division.                                                                                   2.) Metaphase: The dividing cells begin to form their makeups.    3.) prophase: the cells begin to separate.                                     4.) telephase: the cells have split from the parent
The mRNA unzips and the base pairs are switched. T then turns to A, G turns to C, C turns to G and A turns to U
tRNA is created, rRNA is created, then tRNA and rRNA bring the new info. to the protein, and the mRNA comes back
First the mRNA leaves the nucleus.  Then the codons attach themselves to the mRNA strand, creating a copy of the original mRNA strand.  After that, the amino acids are created from the codons.  The amino acids then come together in long strands to become protiens.
The mRNA takes the information to a ribosome and then that is when tRNA comes into play, tRNA takes that infromation inside of the nucleus and attaches itselfs and sends it off to the chromosomes which is the DNA.
Two of the major steps involved in protein synthesis are transcription and translation. Transcription is when the DNA zips open and then the mRNA connects to it. After the mRNA connects to the DNA, the mRNA leaves the cell and goes to the endoplasmic riticulum where the ribosomes are. There is meets up with the tRNA. This process is called Translation.
1) mRNA leaves the nucleus 2) it gets changed in RNA 3) RNA is 'coded' into an amino acid sequence and converts to DNA 4) protein synthesis
1. The mRNA is sent to the tRNA to make the amino acids.2. The data on the mRNA is transfered to tRNA.3. The tRNA is then sent to the rRNA to make the RNA     sequence.4. The amino acids are then connected to one another by peptide     bonds.
1. When the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it travels down the endoplasmic reticulum to go and get transformed into tRNA.2. When it is changed into tRNA, the cell can make different amino acids to make more proteins.3. After the cell makes more amino acids the proteins can make different things. 4 the cells then change and can form and be appart from different things.
mRNA leaves the nucleaus.the mRna goes and tries to find a new amino acid.They carry the amino acid to the RNa strand.Then it creates a a starnd of different RNS's.
They send the message through the body. Then they start telling the RNA what to do. Next they keep transfering the mRNA through the body and last they transfer the tRNA.
The mRNA leaves the nucleus through a small hole, only sizable for it. It then goes to the ribosome. Once its in, the tRNA begings to match it up with the opposite letters in pairs of three. The strand leaves the ribosome in pairs of three, the amino acid sequence to make the protiens we need.
1.  The DNA unzips and is copied to create mRNA which can then leave the nucleus because it is single stranded.2. After leaving the Nucleus, the mRNA travels to the cytoplasm and attaches to a ribosome.3. The Ribosome then attaches tRNA to the corresponding nucleotide sequences. The tRNA has amino acids attached to the end of it.4. After a second tRNA is attached, the aminoacids form a phosphate bond with eachother and the first tRNA is ejected to recieve another Amino acids. This step repeats until the protein is complete, the stop codon is reached, and a the last amino acid breaks from the last tRNA
whem rna becomes mrna it sends out messages to other rnas and then the mrna attatches to a ribison to become rran and the n when the rrna matches up with rrna it transfers into an tran to exchange its geneitc information
After the mRNA leaves the nucleus it travels to the gose to the ribosome. There the strand is pulled apart and then connected by hydrogen bonds to another strand of mRNA. The leftover strand gets sent to the mitocondria where is is broke down. Next the new strand of mRNA is sent back to the nucleus.
The nucleus makes a strand of RNAThe RNA goes to the ribosomes to tell it to make protien.The message in the RNA is seen by the ribosomes.The ribosmomes makes the protien.

mRNA travels throught the cell giving differant things directions or instructions on what their job is and how to do it.
the mrna goes to the ribosomes and the trna tranlates the mrnas mesage so the ribosomes can make protiens from the blueprints it get from the mrna
The protien brakes down
the first step is it reads the RNA.Then it transcripe it and groups codon.The third step is translate the new RNA. Then last it is changed and the RNA is ready to go.
mRNA tells the mitochondria to use sugars and make food enzymes along with oxygen.

1.It leaves the nucleus.     2.It begins to develop proteins.   3.Proteins are half way developed.4.Proteins are developed.
The mRNA must bond with a tRNA first and then get the tRNA anticodon to match up with the codon on mRNA.  This means AGC will have to be pair with UCG.  Then after they break off the tRNA breaks off from the mRNA and goes to the ribsomes for them to make the proteins from the animo acids. Basically it is Transcription, Translocation, and then transferring the proteins to the ribsomes to make the protein. To make the protein the ribsomes must match them in that certain order, which with a new RNA molecule, rRNA, and recieve the information from the tRNA and make the protein with chemicals.
The protein helps your body build and stay strong.
mRNA sends a message to the mitochondrion, it takes the protein to the tRNA, the tRNA delivers the protein, the protein is im;lemented in the cell cycle.
mRNA leaves the nucleus with the DNA information because DNA can't leave the nucleus. Once the mRNA has taken the information to its destination, tRNA then takes place to bring the correct amino acids in respect to the letters from the mRNA. After this is done, proteins are made.
Protein reproduction.Protein function.
mRNA- messenger RNA sends messages of directions to the nucleustRNA- transfer RNA transfers certain things in and out of the nucleusrRNA- ribosomal RNA located mostly in ribosomes
The mRNA gives its information to the next RNA, rRNA which then will pass the information to tRNA while with tRNA the RNA will transcribe the RNA and break it down and anylze it, it will then pass it to the gRNA which is the last step in protein synthesis.
mRNA collects the information from the DNA and leaves the nucleous.
1. The mRNA comes back to the ribosome2. tRNA then finds the correct amino acid for that certain codon.3. The tRNA continues to find the amino acid for all of the codons until the mRNA sequence is complete.4. Peptide bonds attach betweent the amino acids and form a protein.
The oxygen moves through the cell to the nucleus. The oxygen is then mixed with ATP and sent to the ER. Then the ATP is turned into ADP to then make more ATP. Protein is then made and reproduced.
1,mRNA is the first step involved in protein synthesis, mRNA id formed and later leaves the nucleus 2,tRNA transfers amino acids to diffrent parts of the ceell 3,The amino acids are linked together,creating a protein 4, finally all of the proteins are combined to make one chain of protien , ending protien synathesis
umm.mRNA leaves the nuclues.dna returns to nucleus.ribosomes appear.they make the proteins.
Four major steps involved in protein synthesis are messaging RNA, ribosomal RNA, transfering RNA, and protein production.mRNA attaches to a section of a chromosome, and then it copies the amino acid code that makes up the chromosome. Next, the mRNA messages the rRNA to copy this section of the chromosome into an anticodon which is an exact reflection of the original code. The rRNA has the tRNA transfer this code into a set code for a new protein. Finally, protein production occurs where the protein is synthesized to match the original code for the DNA.
- mRNA goes outside the nucleus.- tRNA takes over.- tRNA transfers the message to the cell.- the cell recieves the message.
strands of cells, cell regenaration, cell chromasomes, the food supplies
then you go to pRNA, then you go to oRNA, then you enter tRNA, then gRNA, then you stop.
Th protein starts in your cells then entering your bloodstream.
mRNA goes through the golgi apparadus then through the endoplasmic reticulum then into out the cell membrane
first it has to have proteinssecond it has to have sunlight or some king of lightingthird it has to transports information from one part to anotherlast it has to come back and get more information to transport back
mRNA goes out the cell goes and bonds to an amino acids form strings of proteins that are held together by peptide bonds.
It use prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. In prophase the chromosomes begin to develop chromatids. They are then attatched to the centromere. The next stage is metaphase. The nucleus begins to dissapear. The chromosomes finish their attatchment and line up at the center. The next stage is anaphase where the centromere splits and each centromere goes to a pole. In telophase the cell then slpits in half to form two cells.
the mRNA travels to the ribosomes. there the ribosomes will transcribe the mRNA into amino acids. The amino acids than go back to the nucleus. And the proccess starts over again with the nucleus decidding what amino acids it needs.
The four major steps the happen after the mRNA leaves the nucleus is decoded, processed, moved to another organell, then prepared for protein synthesis.
ProphaseMetaphaseAnaphaseTelophase
The DNA has the code and gives it to the mRNA.The tRNA gets the code and decodes it. The code is decoded by the tRNA.The message is carried out to the chromosomes.

The mRNA goes to the  ribosomes to make tRNA stands.  THis is then taken to make protiens.
1. The mRNA bind to the tRNA2. The anticodons attach to the codons3. A polypeptide chain is formed4. Proteins are made
The mRNA finds an rRNA and the mRNA unzipps the rRNA. It then attaches itself to the rRNA and swaps protiens. The mRNA then leaves and the rRNA rezipps itself.
-enzymes-protein-amino acids
Four major steps in protein synthesis are to transfer the protein, separate the protein, put it in strands, and become useful.
First, the protein makes a copy of its self, which is RNA.Second, the protein travels to the ribosome, which is tRNA.Third, the ribosome reads the mRNA and breaks it down into smaller, three part pieces called codons. The mRNA is broken down by peptide bonds.Lastly, the codons, the smaller parts, are read and are formed into the protein, and the protein is formed.
mRNA- it sends the message to the cells stating the problemrRNA-replicates the cellstRNA-transfers the messagegRNA-gets all of them together
After mRNA leaves the nucleus, it is moved to an amino acid that corresponds with the codon. It then becomes tRNA and each amino acids pair together to make a polypeptide. The poly peptide begins to coil and twist together. As its coiling, it is making a choromosome to create DNA.
mRNA leaves the nucleustravels to the ribosomedrops off 'directions' ribosome does it's job with 'directions' to make protein

Mitocondria regulates the making of protiensthe endoplasmic reticulum makes the protienthe golgie bodys pack it up and the cell uses it
After the mRNA leaves the nucleus, it takes the encoded DNA to the ribosome in the cytoplasm. After it leaves the cytoplasm it makes new protines and then new mRNA is made.
1)takes instruction to the nucleus2)the nucleus replicates the DNA3)the DNA is looked over to see if there are any mutations4)the replicated DNA starts its job
After the mRNA leaves the nucleus it takes the directions it got from the nucleas to the ribosomes. Then enzymes unzip the DNA so it can be copied. Then the DNA that was made is trasfered by tRNA and he transferes it to RNA so that rRNA can put together the nucleotide sequence to make the protiens.
mRNA leaves the nucleus. Then it goes to a strand of DNA and attaches to it. It turns the amino acids in proteins. Then the cell stores the proteins and uses them.
protein synthesis give the body protein so it can maintain at tip top shape,without this are body could not survive
the code has to change.
it takes it to whatever place it goes then takes it to all of the other RNAs
mRNA goes to the cytoplasm.There, it makes copies of itself.tRNA is made.RNA is connected to a strand of DNA.
When mRNA leaves the nucleus after transcription, it then attaches to a tRNA enayme that has the anticodon of the RNA strand that ataches itself and performs translation into a readable source of RNA  for the rest of the cell. While in translation it has multiple enzymes with the amino acid linked to the anitcodon and are connected to the other proteins with peptides. Forming the peptyde chain of protiens. This is protein synthesis.
1.they do mitosis so they can stay alive if one cell is dying.2.more substances come in then out3.cell get rid of the stuff they dont need for the cell
MITOSIS MEOSIS TRANSLATION
1. The plasma membrane itself helps to control the movement of some substances by letting them in or keeping them out.2. The golgi apparatus regulates the movement of substances across the cell membrane.3. The endoplasmic reticulum helps to regulate the movement of substances across the cell membrane as well.
The cell can tell the substances to move across the membrane because the cells need to move to get to the place where they need to go.
The membrane recognizes and lets needed protiens go into the cell.Osmosis is a way they keep the liquid in the cell equal to the liquid outside of the cell.Plants use a cell wall to protect the cell and keep out big things and let the little things in.

1. The postion of the cell sometimes wont let the cell move.2. The flagella will grab hold of something on the side to where it will be stuck until it lets go.3. The procees of the cell will stay in one place until its procees is complet.
cellular wall
First they decide if the substances is good or bad. They insepct the substances by telling if its a protein or a diease.  Secound they elimanate the bad substances. If the substance is good they let it go throw. Third  they ship or store some of the protiens
Proteins are carried by ribosomes to the golgi apparatus.Lipids are stored in the cell membrane to later be sent all over the cell.Stuff that needs to be obstructed from the cell is decomposed by the Lysosomes that travel throughout the cell.
Osmosis, Mitosis, and Cytosis.
Osmosious controls the movement of water across the cell.Diffusion controls how gentic information is moved to another cell.Sodium potassioum pump moves sodium and potassioum around the cell through tubes.
All cells are living.Some cells make other cells.
Transportation so the cell can move particles across the plasma membraneHomeostacis so the cell can do its job normally
The membrane is permeable which allows smaller cells to go through. Membranes have cells that create openings for larger cells.
anaphase: Cells splittelophase: Cells start to splitprophase: Nuclear membrain dissapers
Cell Wall- controls what goes in and outCell Membrane- also controls what goes in and outNucleus- conrtols what the cell does
The cell membrane uses enzymes.
PHILANGES AND TINY HAIRLIKE STRUCTURES ON THE OUTSIDE OF A CELL THAT HELP THE CELL GATHER FOOD AND SOMETIMES EVEN MOVE. IONIC CHANNELS ONLY LET IN CERTIAN AMOUNTS OF CERTAIN SUBSTANCES THIS CONTROLS THE AMOUNT OF PROTIENS GETTING INTO THE CELL. THE PARTS OF A CELL ARE HELD TOGETHER BY THE CYTOPLASM AND MEMBRANE. THIS DOES NOT ALLOW FOR FOREIGN THINGS TO BE ABLE TO PENETRATE THE CELL.
cell respiration
Osmosis is used to move molecules across the cell's permiable membrane.  Also the protein carriers to determine what can move through or across the membrane
equilbrium of substances from higt to low concertrion  diffusion the excreation of water and waste from the cell
Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane include: Keeping all the healthy cells healthy, getting rid of the bad cells, and maintaining a smooth environment.
into and out of the cell
Trna is a movement of a type of cell across the cell membrane.
Three processes are when the cell usese other cells, the use of cilai and flagilia.
The cells use active transport, osmosis, and diffusion to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane. In active transport, the substances move thought the opening (tubes) in the cell membrane to get into the cell. They osmosis, the substances need to be small so they can pass through the membrane. Lastly, in diffusion, they difuse into the cell.
Replication-
Cells use the process of diffusion to take in the substances. The protiens in the plasma membrane change their shape to carry substances throught the membrane and into the cell. Osmosis also brings substances into the cell by bringing them in through the water around the cell.
cillia- these are short hair like projections that cover the outside of the cell.cell membrain- a barier that lets protiens and food in and out of the cells baodycell wall- also a baier but on plants it helps take in light and releses excces water.
Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are being selectively or semi-permeable, osmosis, and diffusion.
Active Transport, inactive transport and escort transport
carries protien
homeostasis
Osmosis is the movement of water across the cell membrane. Transportation through the hols of a cell membrane is another. And the other is when they leave through lysosomes.
They can carry nutrients across.
The cell uses the ER to move things throughout the cell.  It moves protiens around through its winding tubes.The cell uses the mRNA to move information throughout the cell.The cell uses the vacuole to move waste throughout the cell.
The cells control movement of substances by sending things into the endoplasmic reticulum and once inside, the substances get moved and exit through the exoplasmic reticulum, then they leave the body through digestion.
The cells movement is controlled by the cell membrane. It controls what comes into the cell and what leaves the cell. Although the nucleus controls the cell and tells it to move the membrane does most of the work.
Cells use diffusion to transfer water across the membrane. They also use protien holes to move the larger substances. Some things that they move across simply pass through the membrane
1. the cell can control the membrane cause its part of the cell2. the cell can control the membrane like we can do same to ours3.the cell sends a it threw littel tiny cells to the membrane
1.     -Osmosis is how water gets diffused thru the membrane. 2.     -Active Transport is where an enzyme opens the cell membrane for an object to come in, and extra energy is needed to assist the object into the cell.3.     -Passive Transport is where an enzyme opens the cell, but the object doesn't need the extra energy to come in.
the cytoplasm which caries it on the substance.
The ER is used to direct things leaving the nucleus or help things move through out the cell.The Golgi apperatus directs vacules around the cell.
Cells use diffusion to move substances from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration until it reaches equilibrium.  Cells also use osmosis, which is diffusion but with water.
Cells have protective layers that could prevent harmful substances from entering throug the cell membrane.
Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are Diffusion; paricles moving from high to low consentration. Osmises;
Osmosis, balancing water levels.Diffusion of cell materials.mRNA leaving the nucleus.
the cell can move because of the nucleus. The cell wall is located behind the cell membrane so I thank this would  have something to do with it.I aslo thank it is the mitochrondia.
one is the edoplamick reticulum. and two is the cell mimbraint.
1. Golgi apperatus2. Lysosomes3. Endure Rectal
1. The nucleous tells the mitocontria to send a signal to the cell membrane.2. The cell membrane gets the message and tells the cytoplasm to start to push things around.3. After that everything gets moved into place.
Enzymes, Catalist, Eukaryotes
The movement of substances has to make its way through the cell membrane. the membrane Only allowes a few people to go at a time.
One of the ways cells can move substances across the cell membrane is by diffusion. Diffusion moves substances from an area of high concentration, to an area of low concentration. Another way cells move substances across the cell membrane is by osmosis. Osmosis moves water down the cell membrane. The last way cells move substances across the cell membrane is by the sodium-potassium pump. The sodium-potassium pump takes sodium ions out of the membrane and puts potassium ions into the membrane.
Use of the membrane of the cell helps create movement.
active transport, facilitated diffusion, and osmosis.
Diffusion, Osmosis, Endocytosis
Three processes used by cells to control movement of substances across the cell membrane are, diffusion, secretion, and absorption.
The cells absorb the thing and they carry it to where ever it is supposed to go and they start that proces again.
One is by moving the cell away from harmful areas. Another is moving the harmful stuff from the cell and bringing in the good stuff. Lastly the cell can move its self to places where it can get more food or water, etc.
One would be going in the vacule and being use for energy.Two would be useing the mRNA to leave the cell.Thrid would be being used for food for the cell.
the cell slide through the membrane then the cell breaks into piecsand the cell eats
Active transport is where the cell uses energy to move the substances.Passive Transport is where the cell does not use energy to move the substances.Diffusion is where cells release energy
1: They move with the flagellum,so they can move throughout the cells.2: By ribosomes, so they can send energy through out the cell.3: Or by sending messages to one another
The outer membrane of the cell controls how much goes in and out of the cell.  Through the process of osmosis, water moves in or out of a cell depending on if there is a higher or lower concentration within the cell.  Another way they control this is by the growing of the outer membrane.  If there is too much of a substance within the cell, it will break apart to allow enough room.
1. Golgi Apparatus     2. Endoplasmic Reticulum3.Mitochondria
Nerve cells tell the membrane where it is and the membrane uses that imformation to move it.
Diffusion- the process of using water to move across the membrane.Meiosis- the changing of a cell to move or take up space.
The golgi aperatis acts as the bodies UPS man to transport material.Flagela is used by certain organisms to move.
One process used by cells to control the movement of substances is when the membrane has different ways of letting different molecules enter.
1. Golgie Apratus2. Lysomoes3. Endoplasmic Recticulum
The ribsomes carry it throughout the cell.The mitocandria carries it to the nucleus.The clear liquid stuff carries it through the cell as well.
One process that is used by cells to control the movement of different substances across the cell membrane is the fllagellum. the flagellum protects and moves the cell.
Three processes that cells use to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane is protein synthesis, transfusion, and moving waste out.
reproduction respiratin and food gatherinmg
They don't let anything enter the cell membrane.
Three of the processes used in the cell membrane is, diffusion, transfusion, and the letting in of substances into the cell.
One way is when there is more liquid outside of the cell water enters the cell to make an equilibrium. Another way is if there is more liquid in the cell water will leave the cell.
they use their membrane to filter things in and out of the cell then proteins take watever it is to be used
cell wall which controls what goes in and out of the cell.nucleas is the brain of the cell/centermitochondria is the power house helps keep things moving
The three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell memebrane are osmosis, diffusion, exocytosis. These three all help control the movement of substances across the cell membrane.
Osmosis is one process that moves water from a high concentration area, to a lower concentration area. This makes it even throughout the whole cell. Diffusion is another process that moves water from a low area of concentration to a high area of concentration. Activation is another process, it
Nuclear envelope- it is used to take waste out of the cell.Lysosomes
They can control them, they can redirect them, and they can get rid of them.
One processe used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane would be Cell reprodution.
1. Mitosis2. Meosis3.Protein Synthesis
OVER TIME THE CELLS CHANGE AN TAKE DIFFERENT FORMS
mosmis, diffisen, miosis
Cell diffusion, cell respiration, and cell exertion.
The first way cells control the movement of substance is by waste removal wich will allow the substance to leave the body.  The second way is by mRNA which allows the cell to grab hold of it and release it to the waste. The third way is by letting it be filtered while it goes through the body.
1.)Diffusion is something moving arcoss the surface of the cell membrane and then entering the cell, it requires little energy.2.)Theres also spots were things can get through the cell, but it requires more energy then diffusion.3.)And the cell can just allow something in side it.
1.)  It use's the energy from the membrane                                 2.) It use's the light from the membrane3.) It use's the food from the membrane to makeit there and sometimes back to the spot it came from. It only makes the trip maybe three times.
They use the a chemical proccess of enzymes, the membrain also, and through channels in the membrain.
Three processes that cells use to control movement across the cell membrane are proteins, phospholipids, and vesicles. The substances hook on to the protein and are transfered into the cell. With phospholipids, the substance is absorbed and goes through the membrane into the cell. Vesicles form around the substance and carry it into the cell.
The cell wall blocks and keeps substances from crossing into the membrane
Osmosis-the act of transporting water through a selectively permeable membrane.  Active transport-the forced movement of a nutrient or mineral through the cell by pores on the cell membrane.
Cells use ribosomes, mitochondria, and lysosomes to move substances across the cell. Ribosomes carry out protiens. Mitchondria are the powerhouse and provide energy. Lysosomes, which come from the Golgi apparatus, carry out sugars.
Diffusion- The cell transports the material across the cell membrane so the concentration is equal on both sides.Osmosis- The transportation of water across the cell membrane.
Cell Resperation
The cell uses three processes. These three processes are pushing, where the cell pushes the substance crossing the membrane. The second process that a cell uses is carrying the substance across the membrane, and the third one is steering, where the cell steers the substance in order for it not to crash.
movement- helps the membrane move. resirpation- helpts it eat and drink.walk- help it move also.
Some cells use diffusion, in which matter moves from an aea of higher concentraion to  an area of lower concentration. Cells also use osmosis, where water moves froman area of lower concentration to an rea of high concentration. Thirdly, the use active transport in which the cell uses it's own energy to move nurients through its membrane.
cytoplasm-jello like solution that is there for them cell to swim through.flagella-has a tail that helps move them throughout the membrane.cilia-moves cell.
Meosis, is one way that cells move substances. Mitosis is another way that cells move substances. The last way that a cell moves substances is telephase.
it can be moved by mrna,trna,and cells
MITOSIS , PROPHASE,AND METAPHASE
Osmosis, Mitosis, diffusion, the movement of water in and out of the cell
electric currents through the spinal cord going directly to the brain.
Cells use osmosis, active transport, and facilitated transport to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane. Osmosis occurs when water and other materials move from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. Active transport occurs when materials are brought into and out of the cell using the cell's energy. Facilitated transport occurs when materials are brought into and out of the cell using a mixture of energy from the cell and energy from the products.

The cells control movment by blood flow, the size of the cell, and the movement of the cell.
Diffusion is the movement of water over cells. Meiosis is the process in which a substance moves over cell membrane for a short period of time. Mitosis is the process in which water or another substance is moved over a membrane for a long period of  time.
The cell membrane only lets certain things across  the membrane. Osmosis has a permeable layer that allows only certain things across the membrane.The golgi apparatus packages and moves substances across the cell.
Three processes are:1. mitochondrian- 2. lysosomes-3.

Three processes to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are the nucleus, flagellum and ribosomes.
To get food the nucleas. To get shape is the cell wall. Also to reproduce they die off.
Osmosis allows water in to the cell membrane, Reverse osmosis brings water out, and...
The cell membrane is on example of an organelle that controls the movement of substances by having a permeable membrane which decides whether something can enter or leave the cell.Also diffusion is when something is transferred in this case in the cell. The cell uses diffusion to gain things that are necessary for the cell to live. Also the last is osmosis which is diffusion in water. This helps water enter and leave the cell helping th ecell to regulate their processes.
Diffusion, osmosis, transfusion
One way is the golgi apparatus, another is mitochondria, and the third is mRNA.
They use diffusion which they use cells along the membrane to detect things crossing the membrane, they use osmosis which is the crossing of water over the membrane and they use their mitochondria which move waste out of the cell.
The Ion Channel is one of the three, it allows ions to pass through the cell membrane.The Sodium-Potaseum pump is the second of the three.
they are passed through various organelles.

active transport- movement of proteins
Their is a cell wall for plants to protect them selves from bieng hurt.The cell memabrane controls what enters and exit the cell at all times.The nucleuse tells how the cell to function, so it controls the cell membrane and tells it what can enter and what cant.
When molecules are added to a cell, they grow wider. This process is called hypotonic. When molecules leave the cell, this is called hypertonic. And when molecules pass through a barrier in the cell, this is called osmosis.
some process' can be used to move the substances across the cell membrane. one is the funtion of the cell two is the cells cytoplasm and three can be used for the making of the cell that makes the cell come alive and make everything happen
One of the three proccesses is when the cells travel through the blood flow.
One process is the use of the flagellum. It is used like a whip to move things from one place to the other. Another process is the cell puts a protien in a bubble like structure to move it through the cytoplasm. Also, a cell uses a protien to move things around.

Diffusion, osmosis. and
To control the movement of substances across the cell membrane flagellum, cilium, and carrier proteins are used. Flagellum are long, whip-like structures used for movement. Cilium are short, hair-like structures. Carrier proteins are also often used.
Flagellas is a tail that allows the cell to 'swim' around. Slime allows cells to move around. And little tenticles on outside of cell to help swim around.
The membrane just let the thing that has to go out out and the stuff that has to get in get in.

mitosis. The cell splits up to a sister, as they call it.miosis. The sister chromatid grows
Cells use passive transport through methods of diffusiion and osmosis, and also have the abilirty to use active transport with functions such as exo/endocytosis and sodium potassium pumps.
Selective permiablity, which lets only certain things pass, like a window screenendocytosis, brings in certain substances by opening the plasma membrane and absorbing themexocytosis, uses the same process as endocytosis except its removing substances from the cell
There are many processes that control the movement of substances across the cell membrane, but three of the processes are, the movement through the cell's selectively permeable membrane, the movement of waste products by the lysosmes, and the excretion of protiens for the use of the rest of the body.
The cell membrane is used to protect the cell. The cell wall is used to block any harmful things out.
One process cells use to control the movement of substances across the area is osmosis.  Osmosis is when a substance passes through water to move from a higher concentration gradient to a lower concentration gradient.  A second process used to help control the movement is diffusion.  Diffusion is the movement from a higher concentration gradient to a lower concentration gradient.  A third process to help control movement is facilitated diffusion where particles are used to help the movement from the high to low concentration gradients.
The processes are active transport, diffusion, and passive transport.
Cell wall is the first form of protection for the cell which controls what comes in and goes out of the cell. The second peice of protection is the cell membranewhich also helps filture the things coming and going.

One process is osmosis, which helps moves water in and out of the cell. Another process would be going through the protein channels, this moves things in and out of the cell. A third process would be isomosis.
One process used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane is osmosis. Cells use osmosis to either gain or get rid of water by passing it across the cell membrane.      Another process used by cells is cellular diffusion. This is like osmosis, it is the process of substances moving from an area of high concentration, to an area of low concentration.
Cells use the process called diffusion.  Diffusion is used to move the substances across the cell.Osmosis is used to move water across the cell. Translation occurs to move substances.  Transciption also moves the substances across the cell membrane.
The cell membrane controls what goes in and what goes out of the cell. Sometimes there are spaces in the membrane allowing tiny things to get through it.

Flagellum- a tail like structure used to 'swim' around.Cilia- hair-like structures that whip around providing movement.Another one is where the organism extends out sections of it's cell membrane and fills it with cytoplasm while the opposite end goes away and it moves by a crawling type movement.
Cells use many types of transport to move substances across the cell membrane. Active Transport is a process used where the cell uses energy and transport proteins to move substances in and out of the cell. Osmosis diffuses water molecules into the cell across the cell membrane. And finally, passive transport requires no energy and moves with the concentration gradient to move substances across the cell membrane via transport proteins.

The cell uses the flagellum to move easier the move easier throught the cell. The cell also uses it cell wall in order to keep the substances in the cell. The third process the cell uses is its nucleus to control the cell.
1. Active transport is a process that requires energy because it moves substances against their concentration gradient.2. Simple diffusion is a type of passive transport that moves substances down their concentration gradient. This process requires no energy.3. Facilitated diffusion is a type of passive transport that uses protein to move substances across the cell membrane. No energy is required for this process.
1. Mitochondrion2. Cytoplasm3. Nucleus
One process used by cells to contol movement is osmosis. Osmosis is the controlled amount of water that goes through the membrane of the cell. Another process is diffusion. Diffusion is the process by which substances move accross the membrane. This monitors the substances that go through the semi-permeable membrane. Only some substances can leave and only some may enter. The third process is the permeability of the cell. The cell is semi-permeable so it will only let in some of the substances that try to enter the cell.
The  processes that the cel uses to control the movemetn of substances across the cell membrane is by having the rule of high concentration to low concentration, and also low concentration to high concentration. If a substance is trying to move across the cell membrane then that substance will have to be able to move for low to high, or high to low concentrations.
difusion. facillitated difusion. osmosis.
Cells have protein channels that direct the movement of substances in and out of the cell. Osmosis is the process in which outside substances can penetrate through cell membrane. Diffusion is the process of substances moving on a gradient from high to low.
ingulf or eating food, absorbtion asorbing, waste removal
There are a few processes used by cells to control the movement of the substances across the cell. Three examples include homeostasis, diffusion, and meiosis.
The cells membrane only allows certain objects to enter the cell.They also use the nuclei to help kind of filter what goes across and into the cell. The other things they use is a cell wall, of course only in plant cells.
Cells use many things to move things. Defusion is one way, another would osmoses, and i do not know a third. so yes.

Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are flagenal, bristles, and rebosomes.
The proteins control what gets in and out of the cell membrane.If something is too big to get through the membrane it can stretch to make room. Polar heads face out inside and outside of the cell membrane because there is water on both sides. Non-polar tails are smooshed in between the polar heads so they don't touch water.
three processes used by the calls to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are cellular resparation, photosynthesis, and cell division.
one process used by cells to control movement of substances across the cell membrans is the cell wall. another processes but wich cells use to control the substances that cross the cell membranes are the phospholipids that line that cell wall these help keep unwanted thing out as well. lastly one last process used by cells to control the movment of substances across the cell membrans are membranes thar act as little doors that open and close to let thing inside.
Active TransportFacilated Diffusion   Simple Diffusion
Osmosis is the movement of water across the cell membrane. Diffusion is another type of movement process used by the cell. Neither of these require energy for the cell to use. Active transport, on the other hand, is a process of movement which does require energy.
The purpose of the membrane is to help pass over the stuff your  body takes in or needs. It separates the good stuff and the bad.

The three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are, active, transive transport.
the cells absorb it and carry it to where it has to go. the cell pushes it. the cell flows with it to make it go where it has to go
One is a selectively permeal membrane, which only allows what is neccessary to move across the cell membrane. Another is homeostasis, which keeps everything stabilized. And a last one is osmosis, which allows things to move about the cell membrane.
They've got the cell wall so not everything can come in or out.
Three processes used by cells to move substances across the membrane are Osmosis, Diffusion, and Active Transport. Active transport uses energy to move substances from a low concentration to a high concentration. Diffusion carries substances from a high concentration to a low concentration. Also Osmosis takes water only and moves it from a high concentration to a low concentration.
Osmosis moves water through the cell membrane.

Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are the sodium potassium pump, endocytosis, and exocytosis.      The sodium potssium pump pumps sodium ions out and potassium ions in. It is a form of active transport,     Endocytosis moves large materials into the cell by the use of a vesicle; it is a form of active transport.     And exocytosis moves large materials out of a cell by the use of a vesicle; it is also a form of active transport.
The nucleus holds all the DNA and controls the cells functions. The proteins help control what passes through the cell membrane. The cell membrane also determines what comes in and out of the cell.
The three procedures that a cell uses to move things across the cell membrane are, one it finds out where its going too, two it transports it using flagellum, and three it gets to its destination.
water,oxygen,protein
The first type of movement is called active transport. In this kind of movement the cell has to use energy to transport substances across the membrane. This type of movement requires energy from the cell. An example of active transport is moving particles from an area of lesser concentration to an area of greater concentration. The next for of transport is facilitated diffusion. In this type of transport the cell does not use energy. An example of facilitated diffusion is moving particles from an area of greater concentration to an area of lesser concentration. The last process is passive transport. This is when the particles move with the concentration gradient and require no energy.
Active transport- diffusion against the concentration gradient.Passive transport- diffusion along the concentration gradient.Diffusion- The random movement of praticles from an area of high concentraion to low concentration.
1. Absorbing nutrients    Cells must absorb nutrients in order to live. 2. Producing offspring    They must also reproduce to not become extinct.3. Adapting to natural habitats    Cells must be able to be comfortable where they lie in order to survive. They must be familiar with it and know how to live in it.
Osmosis, water is moved through the cell.
Facilitaded diffusion
flagella, cellium,
One is the protein channel and it helps control how much of that substance goes through. Two is the cell membrane which tells the substace where to go and how much of it to go. Three is the mitochondria it also tells how much subtance goes where and how much of it.
1) The movemnets of substances acrosss the cell membrane flow through the blood streams.2)3)
metaphase- slows it down to create the processtelaphase-speeds it up to create the process.
Osmosis makes water go into or leave the cell. Active transport is when the cell uses energy to bring something into it or make it leave. Passive transport is when theres more of something in the cell than there is outside of it, and so some leave the cell to create equilibrium, or vice versa.
Diffusion- to move substances across a cell membraneOsmosis- The diffusion of water into and out of a cellActive Transport- Transporting substances through a cell
Osmosis is when water passes through a barrier, which is selectively permeable in the case of a cell. Diffusion is when the cell tries to reach equilibrium by choosing what enters the cell. Homeostasis is when an organism is in equilibrium with the environment.
Osmosis
1. anaphase2. telophase3. interphase4. prophase
The cell uses three basic processes for movement across the membrane; one is the flagelum, another the cytoplasm and finally the protein in the ribonucleis acid
1. There is the cell wall that only lets wanted materials pass.2. Then there is the cytoplasm that will capturesomething unwanted and get rid of it.3. Lastly there is the nuclear envelope that also only lets wanted materials get through so it helps protect the cell from harmfull things.
IT WILL HAVE TO GO INTO PHASES REPRODUCE
1.photosynthisis2.resperation3.digestion
1. Osmosis-water through the cell membrane2. Diffusion-molecules passing through a membrane into places of low concentration.3. molecules passing through a membrane into places of high concentration
Substances that are passing out and going in through the menmbrane are wastes that have to go through phosphate groups. Osmosis, which if water moving to an area of high concentration to and area of low concentration, either makes the cell shrink or swell with water. It could result in dehydration or overhydration. Thing thats are too big to pass through the cells pores are not allowed intrance nor exit. Wastes and food particles move in and out through the cell's membrane.
Mitosis, Meiosis,
Three of the processes that cells use to control movement into and out of the cell membrane are protein channels that let substances pass through them, Endosymbiosis allows large substances to enter, and Exocytosis allow larger substances to exit the cell.
Osmosis is one kind of movement. Osmosis is the movement of particle across a cel membrane.Diffusion is another kind of movement across a cell membrane. it moves particles across it by breaking teh particle down.Active transport is another way. Active transport uses energy to get the particles across it safely with out harming the cell.
diffusion
Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are diffusion, osmosis, and active transport. Diffusion is the process of substances moving across a membrane from a high concentration to a low concentration, or with the concentration gradient. Osmosis is the same process as diffusion but uses water instead of particles. Active transportation is the process of substance moving through a membrane against the concentration gradient, or from low to high concentration.
YOUR BRAIN TELLS YOUR BODY TO DO THINGS AND YOUR BODY DOES THEM. SAME IN ANIMALS,HUMANS AND PLANTS
Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances acrosss the cell membrane are
Some cells have a cell wall. A cell wall controls what enters and exits a cell. The cell membrane is very thick and can be very sensitive in what it receives into it.Cell membranes only have openings, like doors, to recieve certain sized things so anything unwanted can be left out.
tRNA, mRNA,rRNA
1) The cell  outer wall membrane: Attaches with the rest of the structures and  functionsof the outer most cell.2) The cell's nucleus: Is the major working system that tells the other parts what to do, a correspondent.3) The cell cytoplasm: moves waste and gathers nutrients from the entire cell to supply it with life.
Osmosis is used to move water across the cell membrane.______ moves large particles across the cell membrane.______ moves small particles across the cell membrane.
The golgi apparatus brings in and take things that are needed.The mitocondria processes and store things until they are used.
injection
Cells move across the membrane with the use of osmosis, diffusion, and homostasis. Osmosis is when the cell determines what is, and is not, allowed to cross the cell membrane. Homostasis is when the cell is both equally stable on the inside and outside of the cell. Diffusion is when molecules are entering and leaving the cell.
Three processes that are udes by the cell to move substances across the cell membrane are the cell wall,
Passive transport, which lets substances across the cell all the time.  Active transport, lets substances move across the cell as well, but active transport isn't used all the time.  Diffusion, which is the movement of higher concentrations to lower concentrations.
They use mRNA to carry messages to the mitochondria and the cell somehow use that message or energy.

The Cell membrane controls what comes in and out of the cell.The Cell Wall creates a outside barrier around the cell, to protect it.
Cells divide, carry oxygen to the brain, deliver nutrents
Osmosis- The process in which water passes through a cell membrane.Diffusion- The process in which substances other than water pass through a cell membrane.Active Transport- The process in which a cell uses ATP as a source of energy to push substances through the cell membrane.
These include passive/active transport, facilitated diffusion, and osmosis. Passive transport does not require energy, but active transport does. Passive transport is high to low concentration, and active transport is low to high concentration. Facilitated diffusion is when a protein in the cell membrance is used to aid in the transfer of substances. Osmosis is the diffusion of water across the cell membrane.
THIS IS MOVIENT CONTROL AND BY CALL ACROSS.
The nucleus help with gathering substances. Also the ribsomes help keep them moving. The chromotids help keep track of where everything is.
Osmosis, RNA, and Cell reproduction
1. Cell membranes that allow enzymes to move across the cell. 2. The nucleaus that controls all the chemical processes in the cell to maintain homeostasis.3. The cell wall that allows only certain enzymes to enter and exit the cell.
cellular respiration- The respiration of cells.cell division- the dividing of cells.cell frequencies- frequency of cells.
Active transport:Were enrgy is used to let something go out of the body because it is opposite of the flow.Passive transport:Energy is not used to have protiens or other materials pass through the membrane.Osmosis:Were substances pass through the cell membrane because the cell has lower concentration then out side of the cell.
Osmosis, Flagellum, Diffusion
transportation
One way they try carry the substances across the cell membrance is that the cells will go through a special kind of door that only allows a certain kind of substance in.Another way is that the special exits that let out a certain kind of substance.And finally, the third one, the way that they are moved into the cell through a door that allows both subtances into the cell.
Osmosis is the movement of water coming in or leaving the cell through the membrane. Diffusion is where the cell evens out the matter on the inside and outside of the cell.
tRNAmRNArRNA

The cell membrane uses everything in the cell to control what moves threw out the cell.
1.IT CONTROLS THE MOVMENT OF YOUR BODY MOVMENT.2.IT HELPS YOU THINK.3.IT HELS THE CELL MEMBRANE UNDERSTAND.
Three processes used by the cell to control the movement of rsubstance acrosss the cell membrane is the cell wall, the plasma membrane, and the ezyme.
Osmosis is the movement with water.Diffusion transports materials through the memebrane.Facilitated diffusion
The first process is flagella is a tail like structure used for movement.The second process is called cilia it is little hairs that help move cells.The third process is called transfer RNA. It moves around the cell getting information where it needs to go.
the cell membrane is controlled
the cells us enzymes, amino acids, and chromosomes.
The nucleus. The cell wall.The sugars.

It sends signs to allow that cell to cross over. then it seems that the cells can reproduce.
Cells attach to other cells.
slow the movement down they also can totally stop moving ment or they can let it go right through
FELGELUM
The cell membrane controls the traffic from one side to another side of the membrane.
One way is the tRNA moves proteins to the cytoplasm.Another way is through Active Transport, Active Transport uses energy to force substances out of the membrane. Passive Transport also moves substances out of the membrane, but it does not require energy.
Passive transportationActive transportationDiffusion
Cells are located in the cell membrane.
the flagellim is used to cause the organism to move about .
The cell uses it little fingers to move things across the surface.
Mutation, transcription, and translation are three processes.
the substancs is put in to the golgi and packaged then put through protine and passed through the cell wall
the cells in the plasma are controlled by the current within the cell. then the nucleus opens and lets cell through.
Transfer
Cells travel through the human body when they are needed. It only takes a matter of seconds for them to get to where they are needed. Example: if you got a scratch on ur knee the second its ripped open and there are diseases and bacteria trying to infect it. There are anti bodies and white blood cells are fighting it off.
flagellum
THE CYTOPLASM MOVES SUBSTANCES AROUND THE CELL. THE CELL ALSO USES PROTEIN SYNTHESIS TO MOVE PROTEINS AROUND THE CELL.
they move from one place to another they all go to the human body they go threw the blood vessal
They take in enery from foods,they use their own ways to move around, and they have a shakey way of getting around things.
Active transport because with active transport the substances are active, and moving around, and not just staying in one place.Deletion because it deletes some of the substances if they get in the way of something, that way they can keep moving.Diffusion because substances are kept moving, and don't just stay still.
1.) they can go through 'doors' called channel protein2.) they can insert their 'key' proetin to unlock the cell membrane in order to pass through3.) they can be transported out of the cell by the organelles
osmosis, endoplasmic reticulum
ProphaseMetaphaseAnaphase
diffusion only allows certain particles to leave and enter the cell.Osmosis only allows a certain amount of water to go through the cell.the cell membrane  controls what enters and leaves the cell.

Osmosis is the diffusion of water across the cell membrane.By Mitosis, the cell is divided, leaving more room for increased production and disposal of substances.The Golgi apparatus is used to diffuse substances, such as removing damaged proteins from the cell.
cell resperation it will give it so much oxegen to what needs the certain amout of oxygencell membrane keeps what cant fit in out and lets what is small enough to come inchannels that keep sertain thins though and would let what isnt made for that spacificaly out of the cell
They use the mitochondria to send messages.
Protiens control what goes out and in the cell. They let things in through holes along the membrane, only let what it needs in and out through.
Cells can move substances across the cell membrane by diffusion.  Also by respiration and osmosis.  Water diffuses through the cell membrane.
osmosis, is the process in which water can pass through a permeable membrane.diffusion allows little substance to pass through the cell membrane.
mitosiosmieosis
pross
1.Oxygen profusion- Oxygen profuses through the air over the celll membrane. 2.Cellular diffusion- The substance diffuses through the cell membrane.3. Convection- The substance goes through the cell membrane.
The three processes used by cells to control movement of substances across the cell membrane are reproduction, storing energy and movement.  In reproduction the cell produces offspring.  Storing energy requires the cell to become more active.  Movement requires the cell to adapt to different places in the cell.
The three ways cells move things across their membraine is osmosis, active transport and passive transport. Osmosis is the diffusion of water accross a semi-permiable membrane and doesnt require any energy. Active transport is when molecules are getting diffused against the concentration gradient and passive transport is when molecules are diffused going with the concentration garadient
Homeostasismetabolism
one way is the orgenes move it.there is searten parts of the cell that let it out.
The nucleus gives instructions to the rest of the cell.The ribosomes move important things around, and the cell wall lets things in or out.

Cells control the movement of substances across the cell memebrane the three proceesses are: The cell membrane moves out and in cells.Also it controls all the stuff in the cell membrane.And also the cell membrane carrys stuff into the membrane.
They enter through openings in the cell membrane. There they are moved throughout the cell membrane through tubes. Finally, they reach an opening and are released where they need to go.
reproduction,respiration,proteins
Removes waist, takes in martierials, and
The cell uses openings in the membrane. They move throgh it on ribosomes.
Active Transport- moves materials across the membrane.Diffusion- substances link with proteins to move across the membrane.
The first process is to move it to the mitochdaine. Then they move it the to ensumyes. The final movement they make is to the cell membrane.
they send out messagesthey work togetherthey dont eat each other
1. The phospholipid bilayer selctively permeable to what can enter through the cell membrane. 2. Osmosis and diffusion are passively transport, meaning they go with the concentration gradient and use no energy.3. Active transport uses energy and does not go with the concentration gradient. An example of this would be phagocytes and endocytosis.
One way cells move is using a flagella.  It is a tale-like structure.  Another way cells move is using cilla.  These are hairlike structures on the outside of the cell.  The last way is the psudopod or false foot.  The cell sends out a part of itself and the rest follows.
cell diffusion, keep some cells form moving out of the membrane.
The stimulas keeps the proteins and organalles in place so that the membrane dose not let proteins move freely trough it.
The three process that can be used are in meiosis which would be, prophase, interphase, and telophase. Metphase would not be used in this.
1.they use long whipped like structures to move around2.the cells go and kill the bad things that dont need to be in our body 3.the cells go from place to place multiplying themselves and helping our body
A cell consist of many parts to protect things from getting in. One part is the cell membrane. The cell membrane acts like an outer lining to protect the cell from harmful things getting in. The mitocodria, is another part. It carries out waste from the cell. The final part is the cell wall, found only in plants. This allowes a double protection feature to be sure things don't get in.
mRNA,tRNA,rRNA
DiffusionThe process by which water moves across the semi-permeable membrane.
Osmosis- the ovement of waterDiffusion- the movement in a membraneActive Transport- the movement of energy

The cell membrane controls how substances move across the cell.
The nuclear pores.The nucleus.Premeable acceptable.
The cell membrane regulates movement in and out of the cell by monitoring what passes through.  In prokaryotic cells, an operon (consisting of 'switch' and area to latch onto) regulates the transcription of DNA.  In eukaryotic cells, cell regulation can be monitored by the removal of introns.
MitosisMeiosisCell reproduction
Cells use diffusion, osmosis, and facilitated diffusion to move susbstances across the membrane.  Diffusion and osmosis are types of passive transport.  Diffusion is used to regulate substances with the outside environment using the cell membrane while osmosis transports water and other liquids through the membrane.  On the other hand, facilitated diffusion is a type of active transport.  It is also a type of diffusion, albeit it uses energy to transport the substances out of the cell.
passive transport is when the substance can move freely through the cell membrane.
osmosis, diffusion,
Sodium-Potassium pump-  needs to be an exchange of sodium and potassium for a door to open and a substance comes in.The cell could engulf the substance.

1. they allow what they want to enter the cell.2. they allow what they don't want to exit the cell.3. they don't just let anything leave.
osmosis: This is where the cell lets water penatrate through membrane.
The cell membrane of the cell can help it move. The nucleus of the cell can determine wether the cell can move.
The cell membrane determines what can enter the cell and what can not. Lysosomes act ike 'janitors' for the cells and remove waste. The cell membrane is made up of proteins and carbohydrates.
They can use ATP the takes energy to move them from place to place. Cells also use marker proteins so other cells can read where they are needed to do a job
Selective permeable membrane restricts what goes through the cell membrane. Osmosis also is a selective membrane, which helps the nutrients needed go through the cells membrane.
flagella- it is used to move the cell and how fast it is moving, large hairlike .cilia- it is used to move the cell slower, small hairlike.some cells use thier bodies to move and they move slow.
One is called the cilia. Cilia are little hair like structures that help the cell or organsim move and protect it. And another is a gel like substance that is sticky and slimmy it is what the snails use so they can move it is a thick layer off slim that helps move and protect it.

osmosis is when water is used to move around the cell membrane.
The three mitocondria, amino acids, and dna
anaphaseprophasetelophase
One process is the cell wall because that is the outer covering of the cell so it doesn't let anything out of it.  The second process is the ribosomes because it cannot go past the cell membrane.  The third process is cell membrane itself because it also protects everything and doesn't let anything past the it so it don't touch the cell wall.
Anaphase, metaphase, telaphase
Active transport- uses energy to move subatances across the membranePassive transport- does not use energy to move substances across the membraneOsmosis- the diffusion of water across the membrane
Three processes used by cells to control substance movement are:Nucleus- tells the cell what to do.Ribosomes- transports proteins across the cell.Endoplasmic reticulum- carries ribosomes through the cell.
There is active transport, passisve  transport, and diffusion.
MEOSIS,MIEOSIS,MUTATION
THEY USE PLASMA, RIBOSOMES, AND MITOCHONDREA
active transport, passive transport, and osmosis
The three processes are,they use the nucleus,cell plasmid,and the cell membrane to control substances.
The membrane is selectively permeable.  It only allows things through that it recognizes.  Some things have special entrances to the cell.
TRANSCRIPTION
Cells use vesicles, transport chains, and protiens to control the movement of subsatnces across the cell membrane. Vesicles eat and digest unwanted or wasted substances. When the vesicle dies, so does the cell.Transport chains carry many things across the cell. This way, equilibrium is reached, RNA can leave the cell, and many other things can occur to keep the cell going.Protions act as gates for subatances entering and leaving the cell. They open and have the particles attatch to them. They then close and open up on the opposite side. This way, things that should not go into the cell are not let in or out.
Osmosis is when water comes through the cell membrane.  Other times the cell opens its membrane and allows a substance to enter.  The last type is when a substance exits the membrane may open up to allow the object out.
Three processes cells use to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are: Using lipids to pass on materials, meiosis, and mitosis.
1.) When an emzyne csuch as insulin attaches to a cell it tells the cell to let in sugar.2.) equalibrum is when one side has more of a protien then the other so they transfer the protiens over untill they are equal.3.)When a protien fits into a channel protien to make it change shape for a bigger protien to come through.
Cells use selective permiability to control substance movement. The plasma membrane is semi-permiable. It allows water in and out without trouble. However, it acts like a screen because it blocks substances such as sodium from entering the cell. The plasma membrane uses selective permiability because it controls the amout and when of the allowance of substance entrance. Substances enter the cell through carrier proteins. These proteins are surrounded by polar heads and non-fatty acid tails. This membrane is water soluable. The carrier proteins use active and passive transport to move substances in and out of the cell. Passive transport allows substances to move with the gradient and active transport uses cell energy to move substances against the gradient.
photosynthesis- creattion of food for cell imersion- material going inexpulsion- material going out
The plasma membrane will only let certain things in and out of the cell through
1. Passive Diffusion: The passing of substances through the cell membrane, taking no energy on the cell's part.2. Facilitated Diffusion: The passing of substances through the cell membrane that requires energy, working against the gradient.3. Osmosis: Diffusion involving water.
Three movements are flushing out, bursting vacoules, and breakdown of the cell.
Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are diffusion, osmosis, and endocytosis. Diffusion is the movement of molecules across the cell membrane from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration. The goal of diffusion is to maintain an equilibrium, and have everything balanced. Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane. Both osmosis and diffusion are forms of passive transport. Passive transport requires no energy from the cell to move substances across its membrane. However, endocytosis is a form of active transport. Endocytosis is the process of moving larger molecules, such a food into the cell. This takes more energy from the cell, and may use enzymes to quicken the process.

Cellular division, Cellular respiration, Cellular reproduction.
One process is the mitocondria which  starts the movement of the cell across the membrane. Another process is the Rough ER which keeps the cell moving across the membrane. The last process is the Nucleus while is the distination of the moving cell.
The process used by cells to control movement of substances across the cell membrane, helps move wastes through the membrane and helps move water and oxygen to help the cell survive.

1. active transport2. passive transport3. ficiliated difusion
One type of movement used to move substances across the cell membrane is ATP.  ATP is active transport where the substances latch on to receptor proteins and then are able to get inside the cell.Another type of movement to allow substances across the cell membrane is diffusion.  These substances move from high concentration to low concentration.  Therefore, substances are able to move into the cell or outside of it through diffusion.A third process used by cells to move substances across the cell membrane is thier protein channels.  The protein channels allow certain things to come through.

The things that are not needed in a cell are removed by the endoplasmic rectilium. Messenger RNA carries things through the cell.
One way is that the cell moves on its owe with the help of other cellsAnother way is that the cell carries what it can when it's needed to be carried out.Last way is the cell multiply's continuesly .
the cell wall keeps unwanted things from coming in and across the cell membrane.
The three processes are diffusion, cell movement, and also cell mutation.
cells use cilia, fagella, and sutopods to move things across the membrane
THAY ARE PROSESES USED BY THE CELL WALL
OSMOIS DIFFUSIONDIFFISION
One of the processes is diffusion. The second one is
active transport- active transport is when a cell uses energy to transport substances across the cell membranepassive transport- passive transport is when a cell transports materials across the cell membrane without the use of energyosmosis- osmosis is the transport of substances through the semi-permeable membrane (water)
They swim across. They wiggle. They crawl.
One of these ways is by the cell membrane. This organelle moves and allowes acces for food for the cell . The other one is cloralplast. This is a jell like thing in side the cell and it moves material through out the cell after the substance moves through the cell membrane.
Three prcesses used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are: defication, ribosomes, and cell pores.
Diffusion is when small particles cross over the membrane from areas of high concentration to areas of low concentration. It does not require energy but is a way to keep the environment in which the cell is in balanced.Osmosis is the diffusion of water particles through the cell membrane. It is also relative to the environment and will move from an area of high concentration of water particles to an area of low concentration of water particles.Facilitated Diffusion is when the cell has to use energy to pass particles through the membrane. It is moving particles from low concentration to high concentration.
1.Cell Membrane-the outer oart of the organism.2.Cell wall-protects the organism and anthitng entering and leaving.3.Nucleus-helps the organisms function.
Diffusion controls whether certain substances move across the cell membrane.Osmosis is the movement of water across the cell membrane.
Replication-reproduction of the cellsmRNA-  it take the dna to replicate itGenetics- it makes up what we are
osmosis- is the movement of water through the cell membrane. diffusion- is the movent of any substance through the cell membrane.flegella- the flegella are arms that help the cell move and let substances travel through the cell membrane.
One of the processes is through cell diffusion. The second type is through the process of osmosis which pulls water through the cell. The third type is mitosis.
The to enter the cell you have to use ATP energy.
Three processes used by cells are diffusion, which is the movement of molecules over a selectively permeable membrane, osmosis, which involves water being passed over the membrane, and active diffusion, which requires energy from the cell to move particles through the membrane.
One process used by cells is endocytosis.  In endocytosis, the cell engulfs a particle or another organism by completely surrounding it and turning the space with the particle into a vesicle.  This vesicle can now travel into the cell.  Also exocytosis is used by cells to get certain materials to leave the cell.  A vesicle is created around the particle which is then transferred outside of the cell membrane.  Another process used by cells is diffusion through protein channels.  The directs for a protein channel to be opened up in the cell membrane, and diffusion then takes its natural course of moving from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration until equillibrium is reached.
The cell wall desides what comes in and out of the cell throught its small holes that help make up the cell wall.The holes in the wall help suck in the nutrients that the cell needs.the holes also help remove waste from the cell membrane.
Cells use processes to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane, these processes are respiration, cell division, and also reproduction.
One of them is that the cell membrane is selectivley permeable. The cell membrane controlls what enters and exits the cell.  The nucleus tells the cell what to do because it acts as a brain.
Cells can control which amino acid strains pass through the membrane as directed by the nucleus of that cell.
Osmosis- is the movement of water between the cell membranesDiffusion-movement of other materials through the cell membrane

Three processes used by cells to control the movement across a cell membrane are osmosis, diffusion, and active transport.
CARRY INFORMATION PROVIDE NUTRIENTS
Cells use active transport to get anything that is bigger than a protein through the membrane. This requires energy. Cells also use diffusion to get most liquids across the membrane. The last process that cells use is called osmosis, and that is used to get water across the membrane. Neither the diffusion nor the osmosis require and energy.
The cell membrane has three processes to control the movement of substances, one being that it protects the cell, allowing only what it wants to enter and exit.
Osmosis, the movement of water from one place to another. Diffusion, the movement of materials from one place to another.
cells use diffusion to move subtstances across the membrane and obtain equilibrium.
A cell uses diffusion, osmosis, and transportation. In diffusion, substances are able to travel across a semi permiable membrane. Osmosis mainly uses water to move across a cell membrane. There are two types of transport: active and passive. Active transport uses energy from the cell to move over the cell membrane while passive transport uses heat.
Cells use diffition the a transport that does not use energy.  Cells use passisve transport where a sudstance comes into a cell.  Cells use active transport which a cell uses energy to grab a substance.
One way is by using Cilia to move substances across the membrane with small hair-like apendages. Another way is to use Flagella long whip-like apendages used to move substances across the cell membrane. One more way to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane is by releasing ribosomes.

cells transport energy across the membrane.
One process is osmosis. Another is diffusion. The last is transfusion,
Osmosis: Osmosis is  a type passive transport across a barrier, such as a cell membrane.  This type of transport does not require any energy.Phagocytosis: Phagocytosis is a process by which a cell surrounds a material and brings it into the cell.  This process is a type of endocytosis and this process requires energy. Endocytosis: In this process, a cell brings in molecules or substances, which requres energy.  This is a typw of active transport.

Osmosis is one way cells move water across its membrane. Osmosis is the diffusion of water. Diffusion is when molecules move from a high concentration to a low concentration across the cell membrane. Another way is by facilitated diffusion. Facilitated diffusion is when the molecules move from a low concentration to a high concentration, against the concentration gradient. This type of diffusion requires ATP. A third way molecules cross the cell membrane is by exocytosis. Exocytosis is when a cell releases waste out of the cell. This process occurs by diffusion.
1. ACTIVE transport- moveing substances acroos the membrain that requiers energy 2. passive transport- moves matereals acrose the membrain, requiers no energy
they use their tail for movement.proteinsnucleus
One prosses of moving substances across a cell is Osmosis. This is when water masses through the cell membrane.
Some cells use the cell wall as a barrier, to allow or block certain sustances from coming in.  Other particles may be too large to come through by themselves, so other cells will absorb them and carry them through.  Other cells may use osmosis as a means of transporting or disposing of certain sustances.
-mRNA carries out messages throughout the cell-tRNA transfers energies throughout the cell-rRNA reproduces
one part opens and kinda suck it in and another part filters to keep the bad thing out and then the first part which is the cell membrane closes back up.
The holes in a cell membrane let proteins and other good or bad things that cells need into and out of the cell by opening and closing.The nucleous tells the cell membrane when and when not to open its holes up to let things in and out.

Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane is type of phase their on, the protein that tells when to replicate.
One process that a cell uses to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane is the surface area. If the surface area is too large, the cell won't let any more substances move throughout the cell membrane. Another way is facilitated diffusion. This controls the amount of substances that are allowed to enter the cell.
Diffusion is the process when a substance is transfered from inside the cell to outside.  This process does not require any energy.Active transport is the movement of substance from a low concentration to a high one.  This does require energy.Osmosis is the movement of water through the cell membrane.  The cell membrane descides what water goes in and out of the cell.
There is Active transport, Passive transport, and something else.
The cell can use passive transport, which allows things to freely move in and out of the cell given the concentration of the matter. Active transport uses energy from the cell to move materials against the gradient. One form of this moves materials out, called endosymbiosis. Another form moves them inside the cell, called exosymbiosis.

1.) Exocytosis: A process by which materials are moved out of a cell.2.) Endocytosis: A process by which materials are moved into a cell.3.) Solute pump: Where materials are moved into or out of a cell by a two way pump that runs off of an enzyme. It is a passive transport and an example is a sodium-potassium pump.
Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are reproduction, producing more organisms, movement, moving from place to place, and photosynthesis, if the organism is photosynthetic to make food.
Diffusion and osmosis are two types of movement of substances across a cell membrane. diffusion is used to diffuse outwards. osmosis is used to slide over the membrane.

1.Diffusion- when cells go from a more concentrated area to a less concentrated area.2. Facilitated Diffusion- when molecules can't move through the lipid bilayer and move through the protein channel instead3. Osmosis- the diffusion of water through a selectively permeable membrane
The nuclius is the brain of the cell that controls everything.  The vacuol takes all unessisary wast and bacteria out of the cell. The mitocondrian surve to maximize cellular reperation by increasing cellular communication.
metosis interphase and prophase
Passive transport allows water to enter without much energy being used from the cell. Active transport is the use of energy to move a protien across the cell membrain. Carrier protiens use a certin type of chemical make up to control what goes into a cell. A Transport protien allows molcules of a certin size to pass through the membrain.
Osmosis is when water on each side of the membrane reaches an equalibrium.Diffusion is when any substance reaches an equilibrium across a semipermiable membrane.Facilitated diffusion is when the substance is moved from the low concentration side of  the membrane to the highly concentrated side of the membrane.

There is osmosis, homeostasis, and diffusion across a cell memebrane. Homeostasis helps control the temperature of the cells by knowing how much fluid needs to be in a cell. Osmosis is the process of how much fluid or water is needed inside of a cell. Diffusion across a cell membrane is where it only lets in certain chemicals that the body needs. It lets out the water and other fluid inside a cell.
the ER,  the nucleus, and the cytoplasm.
Three processes that control the movement across a cell membrane is the sugar, ribose, and a phosphate.
one thing they do is keep certain things that the cell wants in or out. This is done by a gate like strycture on the surface od the membrane. this mainly allows almost all things to get in and certain things to get out.
The three process used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are glycolysis, osmosis, and diffusion.  Glycolysis is anaerobic, meaning that it does not require oxygen.  Osmosis is the taking in and removing wastes or materials from the cell.  Diffusion is the movement of water across a cell- may have to deal with a hypertonic or hypotonic solution.
active transport, passive transport, and
Cells use passive transport to help substances move across the cell membrane. The substances are going through diffusion and following their concentration gradient.Cells use active transport, also. During active transport, energy input is needed from ATP to move a substance against its concentration gradient.Cells use endocytosis and exocytosis to move things into and out of the cell. In exocytosis, vesicles fuse with the cell membrane and release their contents outside of the cell. In endocytosis, the cytoplasm moves inward and forms a vesicle around the incoming material.
Firstly, there are only so many entrances through the cell membrane that food or other things can enter through. Secondly, if the cell get to much food or other things inside of it, it will close these holes. Thirdly, there are organisms inside and outside the cell that control the flow of food

Endocytosis: the cell uses energy to envelop an outside object into the cellExocytosis: the cell uses energy to envolop an inside object in order to get it out of the cellOsmosis: Water goes through the cell membrane without using energy
Plasma Membrane: Jelly-like fluid that keeps the parts of the cell in place.Cell Wall: Holds all these parts in the cell, and protects the parts inside such as the nucleus. Keeps foreign organisms out of the cell.
They move around the cells membrane and comunicate by signaling each other and also by comunicating with one another in oter ways they all have a funtion or job to do when in the cell membrane.
Three processes used by cells to control the movement are the cell membrane, the cell wall, and the cell nucleous.

The golgi apparatus acts as a transportation system of protiens in a cell by importing and exporting the proteins. The ribosomes are protein builders in the cell and the endoplasmic reticulum controls what proteins the cell keeps.
Endocytosis- Into cell. Exocytosis- Out of cell.Osomosis- Diffusion of water out of the permeable membrane.
The cell uses osmosis and facilitated diffusion to move substances across the cell membrane.
One process is that the cells use their functions to move substances. Two is that differnet organelles help the cells move the substances. And the third is that the cells guide the substances to their destination.

The cell membrane determines what go into the cell and what leaves the cell.
They carry itwiggle it accrostglide it
The carbon chains on the end of proteins on the outside of the membrane filters what goes in and out of the cell. Proteins on the inside of the membrane block out some of the things that may find a way through transprort proteins. Finaly there are proteins on the inside of the cell which can stop anything from getting into the cell.
the cell has a seletively permeable membrane and uses osmosis and reverse osmosis to move material across the cell membrane.
The process is called Energy Transport Chain.
1. Mitochondrian carry energy.                2. Flagella makes sure everything moves properly in the cell.
Osmosis can be used to diffuse water accross a membrane.An active transport can be used to move objects against the consentration gradient. Protiens imbeded in the membrane are used to do this. It takes more energy than a passive transport.A passive transport uses a consentration gradient to move substances accross the membrane. A passive transport uses little or no energy.
One process that the cell uses to control movment of substances across the cell membrane is by osmosis. Another procces is faciliated diffusion. The last process of movement of substances across the cell membrane is diffusion.
The cell has a cell wall the controls what comes in and what comes out of the cell. there are holes on the cell wall that only certain things that the cell needs and wants to get rid of.
The permiable membrane only takes in food and energy that is need. It also discards the already used substances in the cell. It also regulates osmosis.
cell wall: it can allow things to enter or leave , so it can control how the movement across the cell membrane.cells move causing the movement also to be determinedhow healthy the cell is.
The lipid bylear acts as a wall to block out unwanted particles and if it wants something to leave or enter it will make things like pockets and allow the particles to enter the pocket and it will close itself and allow the particle to leave. The cell also uses osmosis to allow the water to go through the cell.
anaphase-interphase-metaphase-
Dynamic equilibrium: the cell membrane keeps the same amout of substances in a cell as there is out.Diffusion: the movement of water across the cell membrane.Semipermeable membrane: allows some substanes to enter and others to not enter the cell.
The first is osmosis where a liquid moves through the cell membrane by the process of diffusion.  Another process the cells use is that a certain substance may only enter the cell if it has the correct protein sequence.  The last process is that a substance isn't able to move across the cell membrane if it would be harmful to the cell, so the cell membrane's function is to keep these substances from getting into the cell.

The processes used by cells to control the movement of a substances across the cell membrane is movement,respiration,reproduction.
Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are sodium-potassium pumps, endocytosis, and exocytosis. Sodium-potassium pumps remove three sodium ions and recieve two potassium ions through a passageway in the membrane. Endocytosis is a process in which a group of phospholipids surrounds a substance outside of the cell in a circle and carries it in to the cell. Exocytosis is the same process as endocytosis except that the substances are removed from the cell instead.
One process used by cells to control the movement of a substance is that the nucleous. An other way the cell controls movement is when the ribosomes carry information from one  thing in a cell to another. Lastly is when the RNA and DNA make up sequences telling what should happen in  the movement of the cell.
The three processes used by cells are receiving nutrients, throwing away their wastes, and carring out information to other cells.

Diffusion, selective permiabilty, and osmosis
They have a cell wall which protects anything from getting in and anything going out.  They have organelles to break down proteins and get the waste out of cells.  Cells also have mitochondria that increase its surface area to add more respiration to the cell.
Flagella- flagella are long  whip-like structures that help them move across an area.Cilia- cilia are hair-like structures that allow the cell to move aroundSlime- slime helps snails slide across areas.

The three processes used by the cell are the making of proteins,the packing process,and the moving of the proteins out.
Osmosis is movement of water across a selectively permiable membrane.Diffusion requires none of the cells energy to move substances through the cells membrane.Active transport requires the cells energy to move substances through the cell's membrane by using things such as protein channels.
Passive - Goes in and out the cell without using energy
The cell has a permeated membrane that allows certain things in and keeps certain things out. This also allows the cell to get rid of waste.

Cells use various types of processes to move substances across the cell membrane.  Osmosis is the process in which water is transfered between cells of diffrent types.  Cell membrane also detects which kind of materials allow to enter the cells and it will only allow it pass if it has a certain protein coating.
One way of moving substances across the cell membrane is through Active Transport. Active Trasport uses energy to force substances out of the membrane. Passive Transport also moves substances out of the membrane, but it does not require energy. Diffusion is another way of transporting substances.
Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the membrane are: the cytoplasm slowing the substances and acting like a jello to control the movement, endoplasmic reticulum, and the golgi apparatus.
Process one- nuclear envelope and pores allow things to travel in and out of the nucleus. Process two- Cell membrane protects the cell and also decides what can go in and out of the cell.Process three- osmosis

Cells use processes to move substances across the cell membrane. Three ways to do this are active, passive, and diffusion. Active transport requires energy, this may use transport protiens. Passive transport does not require energy, the molecules just pass through the membrane. And diffusion is the the net movement of particles from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration.

The process that is used to move substances from one side of the cell membrane to the other is diffusion.  Diffusion is the movement of solid substances across the cell membrane.  Another one is called osmosis and that is when liquid substances are moved acorss the membrane from higher concentration to lower concentration areas.
Moving from the golgi bodies to the cell wall by visicles is one way. Taking Ribosomes from the Rough ER to the golgi bodies is another. Mitosis could be another way of movement.
First it enters from the contractile vacoule and moves across the cell through the cytoplasm.  It enters out of the cytoplasm into the endoplasmic reticulum to remove waste.

One process is osmosis which controls how much water comes in and out of the cell. Endocytosis and exocytosis are used to control the what substances enter and leave through the plasma membrane. Facilitated diffusion uses energy to allow things in or out of the cell. Selective permeability is a process that allows certain things in the cell and keeps certain things out.
1. Osmosis- particles move through the cell membrane if there is an unequal concentration of the substance on each side of the cell membrane.2. Proteins- a cell could call some protiens to move particles from outside of the cell inside the cell or vice versa. The proteins would sit on the membrane and shoot particles through.3. phagocytosis- a cell will 'eat' another cell.
Respiration- what cells use to liveReproduction- devolopement of new cellTranslocation- moved to different place about the cell
some cells use tale like structurs called fegilia to move. others use use cilia or slide.
Diffusion is the movement of low concentration to high concentration in the cell membrane. Osmosis is the movement of water going from a low concentration to a high concentration in the cell membrane.
The cell moves its way to the cell membrane by fighting off the fungus.  Then it goes through the stages. Then gets to the cell membrane.

It uses small hair like structures to move around. They move back and forth across the membrane to move. then the substance can be moved any where on the cell.
One process a cell uses is called osmosis. Osmosis helps the water transport all throughout the cell and on a permeable membrane.Another process a cell uses is called active transport because substances in the cell are being transported through the membrane to the different organelles.The other process that a cell uses is called oxygen diffusion. The oxygen is being moved around the cells to keep the body from not functioning right. It also makes it able for the cells to stay alive and not die off.
Osmosis is when water is passing through the cell. Active transport is when the cell requires energy to move a substance throgh a membrane. Passive transport is whe a substance does not require the use of energy to be moved out of the cell.
First there is the cell wall in plant cells that block unwanted things from entering the cell. They are there to protect the cell from getting bad things in it like a virus or bacterium or just usless things.  in the cell membrane there is a hole for things like RNA to pass through things still need to enter the cell for the cell to do its job( whatever that may be).
Cells can Osmosis which is the process of which water passes accross a cell membrane. The cell membrane also has small gaps which limit the things that go into the cell, if something to large attempts to go in it will get stuck

isotonic: where there is the same amount of a substance in and outside the cell so the volumes are the sameHypertonic: where that amout of a sunstance is greater on the outside of a cell so it moves in through the semipermiable membraneosmosis: where a substance moves in and out of the cell
The first process that cells use is diffusion. Cells have membranes that control what makes it into the cell and what cannot get inside the cell. The second process cells use are tunnel-like objects. Certain tunnels only can carry certain substances across the membrane and into the cell, such as a tunnel only being used for carbon. The third process cells use is called osmosis. Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a semi-permeable membrane. Water is a very simple and easy to carry molecule, so it easily diffuses, unless there is a balance of water on the inside and outside of the cell-equilibrium.
The cells use the cell membrane to control what comes in and out of the cell.Because if anything harmful comes in the cell it could damage the newly made cells.And if those get damaged then the cells will not be made or funtion properly.
three  processes include mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.
The cell wall keeps everything inside the cell. The vacuole takes out any unhealthy stuff. The mitochondria keeps everything moving and aligned.
Homostasis
Diffusion, this distibutes molecules evenly.Osmosis, water distributing evenly. Active Transport, the cell itself using energy to move materials.
passive transport- doesnt require energyactive transport-requires energy
One process used by cells to control the movement of substances is Mitosis, which splits the cells. Another process is Miosis which splits the cells again, and the third process used by cells is Mutation.
Cells have receptors on their outside, that are in the phospholipid bilayer, that only allow substances in if they match up to the receptors perfectly. Cells also use a process in which they form a 'bubble' around a substance (endocytosis) that they want to bring into the cell (this uses ATP). Another process that cells use to control the movement of substances across the membrane is exocytosis, which is when the cell gets rid of substances by forming a 'bubble' around the substance and sending it out of the cell. This is very similar to endocytosis except it is used for the opposite goal.

The cells help movement across the membrane by keeping stuff like bacteria out of the membrane and it always keep the cell in motion and using the membrane.
cellular respiration which helps the movement digestive system, how the organism gets food and how it reproduces
cells use vacuoles to break down any free living substances, cellular respiration for the cell to breathe, use the membrane to keep out any unwanted substances.
Diffusion- when substances are moved from a high consintrasion to a lower consintratsion.Osmoius- when water moves through the cell membrane.

Osmosis - Allows water to pass through the cell membrane.Diffusion - Allows substances to pass through membranes.RNA - trasfers information through cell membranes.
The nucleus controls what moves in and out of the membrane.If harmful substances are entering, then cells will decrease yet they will reproduce at the same rate.
movement reproduction transportation
First would be that the cell membrane would squish in different direction to allow substances to cause no harm. Second would be that maybe the membrane would do the exact opisite and would resist any impact. Last the membrane might be to move the membrane around to make substances roll off the membrane.
Air, Water, Oxygen     One process of movement across a cell membrane would be from air getting under the substance in the cell.  The next process of movement would be liquids getting under the substance and carrying it across the cell.  Last it would be by oxygen, this oxygen also gets underneath the substance and carries it across the cell.
It moves by the force of the enxymes across the cell membrane.

One type of movement acrossed the membrane is osmosis. Osmosis is when the substance uses water to move across the membrane. Another processes is active transport. Active transport is the processes of moving acrossed the membrane by the membrane being selectivly permeable. The last processes is difussion. Diffusion is when the cells  diffuse so that they can move across the selectivly permeable membrane.
They get rid of nutrients they dont need.They use different cells to do certain jobs.
The cell uses it organells and cell wall and membrane to controll what gos in and comes out.
Three processed used by cells to control the movement of subtances across the cell are called the cilia, flagnelle, and the something else.
The ribosomes decide what enters and leaves the cell. The nucleus lets the waste exit the cell membrane. And, the mitochondria decides at times what can enter.

1. The cell membrane has tiny pores in them, so the pores could block out certain substances that might not fit through. 2. The cell could move to a certain location to 'get away' from the particular substance being produced in it's current area.3. The cells pores have a gateway to them that could allow certain substances to get in and others to stay out.

There are three known processes used by cells to control treh movement of substances across treh cell membrane. One of these ways is that treh cell forms itself around treh substance and then closes in, with treh cell membrane moving around it, therefore positioning it inside treh cell. Another way is that treh cell 'opens up' when treh substance or substances come in contact and then 'closing' after it reaches across treh cell membrane. Another way is that treh cell would move to it, and then absorbs it, in a way of speech.

Cells use three different methods to control movement of foreign substances. One for example would be diffusion. It controls the water that moves in and out of a cell. Another example would have to be that the cell wall uses methods to control what comes in and out. They have many specialized glands/openings that allow specific things to enter and leave the cell.

Diffusion is the movement of water across the cell membrane.Cell wall keeps things in and out of the cell membrane.The selective membrane lets the good things in and keep the bad things out.
One decription of a way the cell controls movement is by it's cell wall. The cell wall protects and sheilds the cell.     Another decription of a way the cell controls movement is by the nucleus. The nucleus keeps the cell functioining.     Lastly, another way the cell controls movement is by ribosomes.
Three processes a cell uses to move particles through the cell membrane are through the Carrier portein, Pump protein and the Tunnel Protein.
The cellia it has little tails that make a cell move, the water vain that go to the membran of the cell, and the memebran that controls the every thing to make the cell move.
There are three different types of proteins used to transport  substances across the cell membrane.  These three proteins are transport, receptor, and glycoproteins.  Transport proteins transport things directly through the cell membrane, as long as they fit.  Receptor proteins check to see if the thing attemtping to pass through are good for the body or not, and let them through accordingly.  Glycoproteins only open for certain substances to be passed through the cell membrane.

The cell membrane allows the material to get into the cell and materail from the cell to move out. The sugars go to the protein and forms the cell's protective layer. Then the enzymes go through the gateway type of process which allows enzymes to switch from one side to the other of the cell membrane. Then the cell membrane lets material go out of the cell and inside of the cell.

Their is active transport, passive transport, and then their is gradient transport. Active transport is were the cell uses energy to bring subtances into the cell. Passive transport is where subtances pass through the memebrane with out the cell using energy to bring subtances.
here are three processes used by cells to control movement a dog and a cat and a human.
The cell membrane is used to control the movement of substances across a cell. The cell membrane may block out harmful substances, and the cell membrane will also let substances needed for the process into the cell. The cell membrane is very permable.
The cell uses the cell wall and the cell membrane to help it move substances through the cell.  These help regulate what gets into the cell and what doesn't.  Once inside the cell the nucleus will decide what is done with those substances.
Cells use diffusion to let substances permiate its membrane.Cells use facilitaded diffusion or use energy to help the substance pass through its membrane.Cells use passive diffusion or dont use energy to help the substance pass through its membrane.
Three types of movement that cells use to move substances acrossed the membrane are, one is osomis. Osomis is the movement of water across the cell membrane. Diffusion is also one, during diffusion a substance moves from high to low concertration.
The cells have three different processes, one is that the cell helps control movement of things in the cell. Another one is that the cell has cytoplasm that holds all the things together in the cell.
Three processes used by cells to control the movement  of a cell is mitchodria, cyplast, and cell wall.
Cells can transfer substances, make more or give substances.
Diffusion is the process cells use to move liquid materials inside and out of the sell by passing through the cell membrane. Respiration is the process cells use to move needed to take in the materials needed to survive and output materials used by other organisms. Excretion is the process used by cells to remove waste products and unnecessary nutrients.
One process is through absorbing the substance into the cell. Another process would be by certain parts of the membrane haveing different roles to fill by having a certain hole in their area this lets larger objects get through the membrane easily and effectively.

One way would be that the plasma membrane controls what comes in and out of the cell. Another way would be from osmosis. Also a way would be through diffusion.
Reproduction- is produsing mre offsprings.
The cell membrane use the receptors of the cell to send out messages of needs to be done. The processes are to find out what needs to be done, fix it and make sure that what was sent out is what was received.
There are several processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane. Three processes are exocytosis, endocytosis, and phagocytosis.
the cell wall protectsthe cell from substances coming in or going out of the cell.
Selective Permiability- selects what substances get in and out of the cellActive Transport- which requires movement and creates  an opening for substances to movePassive Transport- doesnt require movement of cells to move substances
blood flow.
Cells have a selective membrane which only allow certain things to enter and leave the cell. It controls, for example, how much water leaves and enters the cell. Cells also use proteins as means to transport things through the cell to other cells.
Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are: diffusion, osmosis, and active transport.  Diffusion is when substances are moved from areas of a higher concentration to areas of a lower concentration. Osmosis is the movement of water through a selectively permeable membrane.  The water moves from a high concentration to a low concentration.  Active transport is the opposite of diffusion.  In active transport substances move from areas of a low concentration to areas of a high concentration.

translation, transcription, and TRNA.
Active Transport is one of the three. In active transport, the cell has to use energy to collect substances and pass through the membrane. This energy is needed due to the flow of substances outside the cell. The next process is passive transport. In passive transport, the cell does not need any force exerted to gather and allow substances with in the cell. This is because the concentration is much higher within the cell. The final process is osmosis, which is simply substances of higher concentration flowing into an area of lower concentration due to mixing, heat, or friction.

The Cell Membrane will act like a body guard and say weather or not an object or organism can make its way into the cell.  The cell may use asmosis to tranfer material across the cell.  The nucleus is the brains of the cell and it will tell if something is supposed to be there or not.
Cells use diffusion and osmoisis to move substances across the cell membrane. Diffusion is substances moving from an area with more mass to an area with less mass. Osmoisis is the movement of water through the cell membrane. A cell membrane also has pores that particles can enter and exit from.
One process is diffussion. Diffusion is whenever substances diffuse over the cells membrane. Another process is the fission where the substances go through a hole in the membrane.
One movement in the cell is the RNA. Another thing that moves cells is energy.  Another is passive transportation.

The cell does through movements to control the cell membrane is the cell wall. It control what enters and leaves they cell.flegall helps the cell move.
They can use their cilia, flagella or they could not move at all.
Cells have semi-permeable membranes, which allow particles to pass through cell walls, others have permeable membranes, which allow particle to move freely through the cells walls, and other cell walls are not permeable at all, allowing nothing to pass through.

Osmosis controlls how much water can be inside the cell. The cell has a cell memberane that only lets certain things into and out of the cell. There are tiny little holes in the memberane that can only fit certain sized things into the cell, so if the thing that is trying to get into the cell is too big, then it will not be able to get into the cell.
cellular respiration, ion channle, lipid bilayer
THe three types are diffusion, facilitated diffusion, and active transport. Diffusion doesn't use energy to move substances. The movement will always go from high concentration of the substance to low concentration. Once the concentration of the substance reaches equilibrium, or is the equal, the substance will move back and forth equally.A specific type of diffusion is osmosis, the diffusion of water. Facilitaed diffusion is used to transport substances that canot go through te semipermeable cell membrane. It uses no energy because it still diffusion. It uses the channel protiens in the cell membrane so that the substance can pass through. Active transport is used when a substance goes from low to high concentration. This type of transportation does use energy because it 'goes against the flow.' It is used when a cell need to take in nutrients or get rid of waste.
The cell is connected to the membrane and by chanelling the membrane it tells it to move. Protins also send messages to the cell to tell it to move. The cell and cells are linked and communicating all the time.
they processes by cells central movement. They can move by a roddili (spiral).They can process or control their movement by flagella.
a cell controls the movement so it can contrarn the so it can get DAN to the place it needs it.
Flaggelum is used to move. Also in mRNA.
1.They use sodium-potassium pumps to move sodium and potassium in and out.    2.They use vacules to ingulf food through phagocytosis.3. They use markers to deside if the substance is ok to travel into the cell.

The cell membrane is the cell structure in which any subtance moves across because it is the outer part of the cell and allows anything to pass on top of it.The cytoplasm that is on the cell membrane is a very helpful factor to help things move across the membrane.All cells have a special ability to move across the cell membrane. They have a flagellum that is a tail-like structure that enables the cell to move.
Flagella is one of the three processes.

1. the nucleus controls the whole cell and its actions.2. the mitocondria makes proteins the cell needs to survive. 3. the cell membrane is the gateway of the cell it controls what enters and exits the cell.
Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are cell membrane, cell wall, and vascular system.
1. nuclear membrane2. enyzme 3.
Cells use multiple processes to move substances through the membrane. One major type of cellular movement is passive transport. With passive transport, the cell won't have to use any energy to move the substance. The cell can use diffusion, or osmosis if the cell is moving water. The cell can also use active transport to move substances. It can use endocytosis, to bring substances into the cell, or exocytosis to push substances out.
One is osmosis where different parts of the cell come together to protect and control movement from the cell membrane.  The second is transcription where it controls the rate and what crosses through the cell membrane. The third is translation it helps create rna that can help later on to control what crosses the membrane.
osmosis, mitosis, and meiosis
First of all, cells have a semi-permeable membrane that allows only what the cell wants to allow in.  Second, cells use the cytoplasm in the cell to move and hold different substances and items that are in the cell.  Last of all, some cells have a cell wall that doesnt allow anything in, except for a few spots where the wall is discontinued.
1. tRNA2. lysosomes3. other organelles
First the tranportation of materials the cell needs to survuve. Seconed the transportation of waste out of the cell. And Third the transportation of nutieants to the body and other cells that need it.
Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane, are :diffusion, miosis, and movement.
cells use cyotplasm for certain things to move through the human body. Cells also use blood to move certain proteins and cells through the body.
Cells use oasis, mitosis, and miosis.  It helps water and other materials go from cell to cell.
active transport, diffusion, passive transport
Wall cells are in plants to keep the strucure of it.
One of the processes used by cells would be the The NUCLEOUS to tell the cell what to do. Then there is the FLAGELUM Which is the tail the moves to help the crell move around. The last one would be the CELL MEMBRAIN That holdeverytjing in and not floting out.
osmosis, active transport, diffusion
Cell respiration, cell movement, and cellular activation
Cells can multiply.Cells can help organs.Cells also move throughout the cell membrane in order to keep everything funtioning correctly.
Diffusion:  movement of materials from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration.Osmosis:  moving of water across the cell membrane from high concentration to low concentration.Sodium-Potassium pump:  movement of potassium ions across the cell membrane, being replaced by sodium ions.  (Results in the feeling of something (pain, heat, cold.))
Diffusion which is the processes of moving materals in and out of the cell, osmosis which is the procsess of water moving in and out of the cell, and fermentation which controls the proteins coming in and out of the cell
blood movement cells
The three processes used by a cell to control movement of substances across the membrane are...
Active Transport is when what substances use to cross the cell, Passive Transport is what the substances use to help control the cell.
Three processes to control the movement are diffusion, osmosis, and facultative diffusion. Osmosis is the spread of water through an area. Diffusion is when water is used in various parts of the organism and stored throughout the body. Facultative diffusion is when the nutrients are stored to be used for later.
Difusion, helps move water based particels in and out of the cell. Osmosis:  move non water based particels in ond out of the cell.
The proteins only allow for specific organisms to pass through. The cell membrane is made of material which only nonpolar organisms can pass through.
Diffusion is where the cell moves things acrost the membrain without using energy. Active trasport is a prosses that requires energy to move things acrost the cell.
Mitochondrian, plasmids, and the ribosomes.
All the membranes are different from evrey other one.
Diffusion is one processes used by cells to cntrol movement across the cell membrane.
diffusion when particles separate in the air
Cells Use tails to move. Others just slid acrossand they work together
osmosis,
homeostacious
The cell membrane will only allow RNA through. The flag lets it know where to enter. Then it will only let waste out.
Diffusion
cell wall cell membrane nucleus
The first process used by cells to cross the membrane would be known as diffusion. Diffusion uses no energy when particles are moving from a concentration of high to low. If they are moving from a concentration of low to high then this does use energy. Diffusion continues until the membrane has obtained equillibrium on both sides.      The second process of cells moving across the membrane is known as osmosis. This is the same as diffusion only water molecules are attempting to cross the membrane. This type of diffusion is known as passive transport and requires no energy. Water needs to be moved in and out of the cell by osmosis to maintain homeostasis.     Facilitated Diffusion is the third process by which substances move across the membrane. This is done by a membrane protein and requires signal molecules to signal the protein to open and close. Once the substance has entered the membrane protein, the protein closes on the outside of the membrane and opens on the inside of the membrane, letting the substance in.

1.substances move through the organelles2.tRNA transfers it across the cell3. transcription
Active transport helps with the flow of water in the membrane. Protein transport helps bring enzymes into the cell. The channel proteins, 'V' shaped, move things in and outside of the cell. Also, carrier proteins, tube shaped, move things in and outside of the cell.Passive transport helps bring proteins into the cell.
The cell uses threee processes by the names of mieosis, mitosis, and cell reproduction. Meosis is when the cell divides and turns into another cell aloowing them to increase in numbers. Mitosis Is when the cell membrane forms around the nucleus to protect it. ( this only occurs in Eukaryotic cells ).Cell reprodustion is when cells multiply allowing more cell to be created and a person be healthier.
Substances go through the cell.
Endocytosis. Endocytosis is when the cell uses a vesical to transport large substances into the cell. Exocytosis. Exocytosis is when the cell uses a vesical to tranport large out of a cell.Ion channels. Ion channels only let certain molecules into the cell.
Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell are, one the cell wall, which is used to keep things out of it and another one is the mitochondria maximizes cellular respiration by and lysomes take unwanted proteins out of the cell.
1. Active transport - uses enery to move subtances through a carrier protien to the rest of the cell2. Facilitated transport - does not use energy to move substances through a carrier protien3. Passive transport - the suctances move right on through the membrane with using any energy.
The cell membrane will open allowing and manuever nutrients into the cell. The cell membrane will manuever waste out of the cell.
flagellum i dont know
There are many ways a cells materials can enter of leave a cell. Endocytosis is how a cell takes in needed materials in which are to big to fit through the lipid bilayer. Exocytosis is a process in which cells get rid of any waste materials to big to fit through the lipid bilayer. Another way to move substances across the cell membrane is by the sodium-potassium pump. The sodium-potassium pump alows potassium to enter a cell, and sodium to leave a cell. Sodium-potassium pumps only open one way at a time. For example, when the pump is recieving the potassium from outside the cell, the sodium waiting on the indide of the cell can't move through. Endocytosis, Exocytosis, and sodium-potassium pump are three ways substances move across the cell membrane.
Three processes used by cells to control movement of substances are growth, synthesis and growth 2.
The three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the membrane are *cytoplasm in the cell*the nucleoids in the cell*the nucleaus controls everything in the cell
three prosses that control the movement of a substance is the passive active and transport
Osmosis allows water to move freely around inside and outside the membrane of the cell.  Diffusion allows wastes to exit the ceels throught selected pores in its membrane.  The lipids and proteins aloow any nutrient to go through the surface of the cell.
The cell wall or membrian lets the substance into the cell then the ribosions tak eover and start to break down the substance, and finale mitocondrean destro and eat the substance and use it as food.
osmosisexocytosis is where they take large objects out of a cell with vesiclesendocytosis is where the cell takes in objects
1) Mitosis- the cells seperate and move to opposite ends of the cell membrane. Which can somewhat guard the movements.2) Meosis- The same process occurs as in mitosis, except more cells will be produced. Gaining more control for the cells. 3) Reproduction: the cells can reproduce many time, then the cells can have full controll over the cell memebrane. Making it hard for harmful substances to enter the membrane.
Osmosis, which is the diffusion of water through a semi-permiable membrane, is one process that a cell uses to move substances across the cell membrane.Cells also use facilitated diffusion. In facilitated diffusion, glucose molecules, which normally would not be allowed to cross the cell membrane, is moved across the cell membrane through protein pumps.Active transport is also used by cells to move substances across the cell membrane. In normal diffusion, water moves from high concentration to low concentration, but with active transport, the cell uses energy to move substances from low concentration to high concentration.
1. Selection- The membrane selects what is going and is coming out.
The flagellum is used for movement across the cell membrane.Proteins.
1.Digestion 2.reproduction 3.breaking down materials
The cell membrane keeps the things from going in and out.
Controls what goes in and out, allow substances to get in,and removes any thing that's not suppose to be in there.
Three processes used by the cell are the mitochondria stopping substances, the cell wall not letting substances into the cell and the nucleus regulaating the cells movement.
The cell uses mitochondria on the cell membrane to move substances across. Also, the cell membrane can control what substances goes in and out, and it can block out certain substances. Lastly, the cell could use flagella to help move the substances also.
sperm and egs
mitosisosmosismeiosis
One process is when the ribosomes transport the genetic code across the ER, which can be smooth or rough.
The cell wall serves as a wall to keep things from getting into the cell. In order for things to move across the cell membrane they have to get in the cell wall.A substance may use their flagellium to move across the cell membrane.
The cell can use the Goolgi the move food and things around. The  cell membrane also control what comes in and out of the cell.
One way the cells controll movement of substances across the cell membrane is through it. A second way is to go across it. And the third way is to go out of it.
osmosis, meiosis, mitosis
osmosis the substances absorb into the celldiffusion they diffuse threw out the membraneactive transport helps move on thing to another
Tails are used to move cells around.They also use tiny hairs to swim around.
The cell must know what is going across the memebrane friest so it knows if it has to keep it or get ride of it because its bad for the cell. The next thing the cell should do is keep all organisms that they know they need to surive.
diffusion the golgi and the rough endoplasmic reticulum
The 3 processes used by cells to control movement are osmosis, diffusion and active transport.
the cell membrane controls what the cell does and how it functions.cellulair respiration is a process by which cells carry oxygen to the blood stream.the mitochondria is how the cells get energy.
For cells to move some use the flagellum. It is like a tail and moves so the cell can reach it's destination. Other cells also scatter around until it find the right place. Last but not least alot of cells have tiny hairs that have a certain movement to get it where it needs to go.
There is a endoplasmic reticulum that acts like a guide in the cell. Then there is flagella in the cell that helps control the movement. There is also cytoplasm that helps the control.
miosis, mitosis, and
Osmosis- diffusion of water.Meiosis- cell reproduction.Mitosis- another type of cell reproduction.
Potassium pump, diffusion, exocytosis.
The three processed used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are; mitosis, meiosis, and cellular respiration.

selective permability
1The goglie bodies help by getting rid of stuff not needed in the cell. 2. The cillia helps the cell move
if the cell was a plant cell it would have a cell wall that could have be used for the cells food. in an animal cell it controls the amout of sugers, wast and other stuf that makes the cell work. equialibram helps the cell gain or lose water.
cilli microvilla an villa
Osmosis is the process where water flows in and out of the cell membrane.Active transport uses energy to move molecules throught he membrane of a cell.Passive transport is a process where molecules move through the cell membrane without the use of energy.
The endoplasmic reticulum carries things through the cell. It is like a highway. The cell moves water in and out of the cell in the process of trranspiration.  It does this to maintain homeostasis The cell moves oxygen in and carbon dioxide of out of the cell through the process of cellular respiration.  it also does this to maitian homeo stasis.
they use there body movments
selective promobility is one way that the cells control the substances
Cells control the movement of substamces across the cell membrane by not allowing any harmful substances through the membrane, being simi-permiabel by controling what can and can't go through the membrane, and going throug exocytosis to get rid of any harmful waste inside the cell.
movement, reproduction, and respiration. Movement to move, Reproduct to make more, and respiration to help the body.
TranscriptionTranslationProtein Synthesis
1. Everything passes through the ER.2. Vacuoles take care of the waste products.3. RNA carries information.
the nuclues sends messages to the cell to tell things what to do and what is happening. the ribosomes are little things that helps build energy and theres also the cytoplasm that runs through the cell membrane.
MieosisMitosis
The cell wall is one-it only lets certain substances enter the cell.The cytolasm is a substance that fills the cell with a jelly material.The vacuoles moves throughout the cell getting rid of certain substances.
The cell membrane blocks certain things from entering and leaving the cellCells membranes fight off any mircroorganisms that try to enter and arnt supposed tooIf the cell membrane doesnt recognize it it wont let it in
The cell membrane can control what moves into and out of the cell. Mitosis is when the cell divides and and that can help move things across the cell membrance. The cell need to grow and divide or else it would become to big and explode. If it didn't control what moves into and out of it we would most likely die.
The membrane surface in a cell is referred to as being 'semi-permeable.' This means that only certain things are capable of entering the cell. Therefore, the membrane would regulate what enters or leaves the cell. With these particular processes happening, the travel of substances across the cell membrane would be limited.
They absorb the substance into the cell, they surround the substance with the cell membrane, or they keep the substance out of the cell.
Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are diffusion, facilitated diffusion, and osmosis. Diffusion always substances to move across the cell by slowly being moved through the cell membrane. Facititated diffusion always larger objects to be moved across the cell membrane. Osmosis is where something is moved into the cell by shrinking it and then it regains its shape after being moved into the cell.
The cell membrane checks to see if the substance is good or bad for the cell. Then the cell membrane lets the substance inside of the cell. Finally the substance is transported through the cell through the endoplasmic reticulum.
MIOSISOSMOSISREPRODUCTION
Three processes that cells use to move substances across the membrane are diffusion, osmosis, and endocytosis. Diffusion occurs when there is a high concentration of materials out side of the cell, and a low concentration of the materials inside the cell.  The materials then pass through the membrane into the cell to balance it out without using energy.  Osmosis is similar to diffusion, but occurs with water.  The water passes through the cell membrane to balance out the concentration of the water, without using energy. Endocytosis is a form of active transport where energy is used to bring materials from a low concentration into a higher concentration, into the cell, through the membrane.
Osmosis is water coming in or leaving the cell.Diffusion is making equilibrium by moving across the membrane.Passive transport is where you move things into the cell from the outside.
anaphase interphase and prophase
They might have a Flagtum or whip like tail to move.
The three processes are diffusion, faciliated diffusion, and osmosis.
meioses, cell division, geting rid of waste.
Cells use different processes to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane. One of the processes is a semi permiable membrane that allows only certain substances to pass through. This membrane is like a pasta strainer. The strainer lets the water out and keeps the pasta in. another way cells control movement is by ATP. ATP is large amounts of cellular energy that is used for movement. Another way is by a cell wall. Cell walls do not allow any substance to pass in or out of the cell. There are many more ways a cell controls the movement of substances across the membrane, but these three are the most common.
The three phases I know are metaphase,anaphase, and telophase.

they can move across water. They eat the other fish. The can swim
Cells first recognize what is going to be comming through the membrane by sending a singnal to the nucleus so it then cna decide whethere or not whatever wants to enter can. Then the Golgi bodies transport whatever it is through the cell.
Three processes used by the cell to control movement of sudstances would be citoplasma, nucius, and mitocondrean.
Three processes are that the cell has a cell wall and is connected to other cells. Another is that it chooses what to enter it and it acts like a barrier for other things.
telephase gives the information to the nucleusAnaphaseInterphase

Osmisis, one using energy, one not using energy
The first procees used to control movement of substances across the cell membrane would be trascription, which takes protein and turns it into mRNA. Translation takes mRNA and decodes it for the cell to read and use. Osmosis is another process, used by cells. Osmosis makes the fluid in a cell try and reach equalibrium.
One type of movement control is passive transportation.
eye spot, flagellum and contracule vacule
One would be reproducton.
There are three processes that I know of that are used by cells and they are passive and active. Passive means that the substance is able to pass right through. Active is when it has to go through a process to go through the cell memebrane. Diffusion is another one. Substances diffuse to go through the cell membrane.

cell division, cellular respiration, cell wall
Diffusion, which allows materials to pass in and out, osmosis, through which water passes through the membrane, and active transport, in which specialized processes transport materials past the membrane.
They let substances in  and out through the membrane.  all the organs in the cell have a suspecific job to do to get what the cell needs
Cell membranes let go of waste, eat and engulf food and can block bad stuff from getting in.
They are transfered.They carry the substances.
Cells use different organels inside the cell to move substances across it. Three processes of moving substances would be, using the mitocondria to move waste from the cell. The cell wall also helps filter and move waste in and out of the cell. The cell nucleus controls what goes in and out of the cell as well. That's a few ways cells use movement.
they control the movement across the cell mambrane by taking control of each individual part of the cell.

Meiosis is used throughout the cell membrane to control and develop more cells. MRNA and RNA are used as messengers to carry the information to the needed destination. Lastly, the information is received and it has ended,
tRNA, mRNA, rRNA
Three processes that control the movement of substances across the cells membrain are equalibrium, the consentration gradiant and cell division. the consentration gradiant is when the partical move from higher consentration to lower consentration. If the cells consentration gradient is to high it can brust or if it is to small it will shring so it has to be normal.

There are three different types of processes a cell uses to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane. The first type of movement is called active transport, which is when the cell is physically doing something. The second type of movement is called passive transport, which is when the cell itself if inactive and the person is doing the work. The third type of movement is osmosis which is the diffusion of water.
energybloodother
They use the flagellum to move, therefore it could help move things across the membrane. Also the muscles, like with blood flow, and finally the heart because it pumps blood and oxygen all over the body.
Three processes that are used by a cell to control movement are osmosis, diffusion, and active transport. Osmosis is the movement of water across a selectively premiable membrane. It requires no energy, so it is called anerobic. Diffusion is the movement of particles in a cell from high to low concentration, this process also uses no energy because it goes with the concentration gradient. Active transport is the movement of particles in a cell from low to high concentration, this process uses energy, or ATP, because it goes against the concentration gradient.
Endocytosis is used to let large mollecules into cells. Exocytosis is used to get them out of the cells.
Three processes used to control cell movement are,
mitosos, meisosis are two ways that cells control the movement across the cell membrane because they are the cycles where new cells are formed.
Cillia, flagella, and
Digestion.Respiration.Inversion.
On the cell membrane there are little holes that are selectivley premable, which allows only certian things to cross and not cross into the cell.
One way you can transfer substances through a cell is by the use of water or otherwise known as Osmosis. A second way you could transfer substances is by transfering enzymes through the cell membrane. A third way substances get transfered through the cell membrane is using mRNA to transfer proteins through the cell.
1. Flagella.2. plasma membrane.3. mitochondria
Cell wall-blocks unwanted material from getting inCytoplasm-helps regulate RNA
OSMOSSES' DIFUSSION AND THE MEMBRAINE
When a cell needs energy, or food, the plasma membrane lets the food inside of the cell where it is processed by mitochondria. On the cell membrane, there is a series of locking nodules that prevent unwanted substances from entering the cell. Also, things like cilia and flaggellum aid in cell movement and could also possibly aid in the movement of substances.
mitosis moving cells.
The three processes used by cells to control movement of substances are mitosis, meiosis, and passive. Passive is when substances can get through easily. meiosis is also the process how cells divide as mitosis is too.
The nucleus helps control the movement of substances across a cell membrane by telling the substance where to go.The cell wall also helps guide it through keeping the nucleus from getting stuck or trapped in something  because the cell wall is  there to protect it and keep unneeded things out.
1. Osmosis: the differation of water across a membrane.2. Active Permeability: the ability of a membrane to control what flows in and out via special organelles. This is done with carrier proteins that carry the materials 'against the grain'.3. Free-flow permeability: Permeability in which the materials naturally flow into or out of without the help of carrier proteins.

cells use severa;l diffrent processes some examples are how the cells use the nucleus to manuver and plan the movements that allow the substances to travel across the cell wall. some of the cells use their ribosomes to manuverthem. then they could also use their endoplasmic reticulum or their ER to make this process possible. this is only a few posible ways that cells could control the movement of substances across the cell membrane.

the three processes used by the cells to control the movement are through protein chemicals, lysomes throughout hte cell and through the blood.
osmois: which is the movement of water through a cell membranediffusion: the brackage of tissues along the cel membranehomostatis: which is the internal balance
The cell membrane uses diffusion and osmosis
1. OSMOSIS- THE MOVEMENT OF WATER IN AND OUT OF CELLS2. DIFUSSION- THE MOVEMENT OF PARTICLES ON AND OUT OF CELLS3. THOUGH PROTEINS
the three things used by cells are cellular resperation
1. Free pass or moving freely through the membrane2. Diffusion or the movement of water from high pressure area to low pressure are through the membreane.3. Proteins or the movement of proteins through special small tubes in a cell's membrane.
DIFFUSION EVENS OUT SUBSTANCES SO THEY REACH EQUILIBRUM, WHICH IS WHEN THEY ARE EVENLY SPREAD THROUGHOUT A SPACE.OSMOSIS IS THE DIFFUSION OF WATER.THE CELL MEMBRANE IS CONSTRUCTED SO THAT CERTIAN SUBSTANCES CAN FIT IN THROUGH IT AND OTHERS CANT.
They control the movement by telling things where to go.
one is there protein that helps it movetwo is all the cells inside of itthree is all the things inside it
The cell membrane has 3 processes that it has.1.) It protects the cell 2.) It moves the cell in any way.3.) It can bring food in or out.
The genetic information start out as combinations in the nucleus. When they are switched to MRNA also known as messenger rna that sends a message to the organelles stating that the genetic code needs a specific substance. The third process  is TRNA or transfer rna which transfers the message to the specific orgnelle. The whole process then repeats itself.
Diffusion: If a susbstance has a higher concentration on the outside of the cell, then the cell membrance will diffuse the substance into the cell creating equilibrium. It will do the same thing if the concentration is lower outside the cell only opposite. This is a type of passive transport because the substance is moving with the concentration gradient and it doesn't require any energy.Facilitated Diffusion: If the particles are too large to diffuse across the cell membrane, then protein pumps help. These carry the substances across the membrane without using any energy. This is also a type of passive transport.Osmosis: Osmosis is the process of diffusion only with water. If concentration of a substance is greater outside the cell, then water will move out of the cell to create equilibrium. If the concentration is lower outside the cell, then the cell will move water into the cell to create equilibrium.

cells use endocytosis, exocytosis and osmosis to move between membranes     In endocytosis, material is encased and becomes part of a cell. in exocytosis the cell encases things inside of itself and sends them out.in osmosis, water is difused and material travels through the membrane
Facilitated Diffusion- allows only certain molecules through membrane and is not going against concentration gradient.Osmosis- the diffusion of water across a membrane.Protein channels- integral and peripheral proteins carry substances into and through membrane into the cell.
Three processes used by cells to control the movement of subtances across the cell membrane are enzymes can move them.
Osmosis is the moving of water across the membrane.Endocytosis is things happening in the cell.Exocytosis is things happening outside the cell

They have the whip- like structure.cells to control the movement and to gather the food. gather up and move as a team to protect each other.
cell membrane allows certain materials to move around the cells
osmosis, active transport, and passive transport.  active transport moves substancces freely across the cell membrane, osmosis is where plants slowly absorb substnces and passive transport moves substances across the cell membrane slowly.
One way of movement is the use of flagellum witch is a long tail like structure the moves behind the cell.The second is cilia witch are like tiny hair like structers that are all over a cell witch give it mo bilty.
Photosynthesis is the process in which an organism collects enegry from sunlight.Homeostasis is the process in which an organism stores and collects enegry.Another process in which an organism produces it's own enegry.
Cells breaking down. feeding the cells. and letting the cells grow.
The three substances that control the movement across the call membrane.The call wall,clorplast,mitochondrion.
osmosisactive transportpassive transport
As one way of controlling the movement of substances across the membrane, cells use selective permeability. Selective permeability is the process by which cells decide which substances should go into or out of the cell and which shouldn't. Cells also use passive transport, which requires no energy from the cell itself, to do the same thing. Finally, cells use active transport, which goes against the concentration gradient and requires cellular energy. Two types of active transport are endocytosis, the process of letting materials into the cell, and exocytosis, the process of expelling wastes and other unwanted materials from the cell.
There are different kinds of processes that cells use, in this case in humans, such as:1. The White Blood Cells control how much blood is lost and  they are in charge of healing the spot were it is cut.2. The Red Blood Cells controll the blood coming from the heart to throughout the body.3. The Brain Cells can control brain functions and how much blood is taken from the heart and aloud into the brain.
The three processes that help a cell control the substance movements over its membrane could be diffusion, the movement of any particles through the membrane, or equilibrium, which is the outer concentration being equal to the one inside, and the process in which the cell produces energy, which is transfered out of the cell.
Celluar respiration.
The cell membrane is a thick-layered 'wall' that can sometimes prevent what goes in and out of the cell.  It also detects what is suppose to get into the cell.
the cell membrane sends out messages to other parts of the body.movement sends vibrations over the cell membrane causing it to function in different ways.
1. The cell membrane blocks cells from moving around.2. A process called cellular respiration.3. A process called cell diffusion.
osmosis diffusion endocytosis- controls what comes into the cell
Active transport, passive transport, and protein channels
The cytoplasm helps to hold all of the organells and helps things to move. the nucleus determines if the substance can enter the cellif the substance can enter the cell, the cytoplasm allows it to enter
the nucleus controls everything,the mitochondria tells wat enters and leaves the cell.
The cells need enzymes to live that help them make tissues then make organells like the heart, lungs, and mussels
THE WAY THE CELL MEMBRANE IS DESIGNEDIT LETS SO MUCH WATER IN IT
Osomises- The balancing of water inside and outside of a cell or necleaus.I don't remember the other two.
Cell mebranes are semi-permeable. They only allow certain things to enter in and out of the membrane.Proteins can be on the mebrane to guide things into the cell through active transport.Diffusion allows items to go from a high concentration area to a low concentration area through the membrane.
acctive transport, diffusion, non-active transport.
Most cells have a cell wall to controll what goes in and out of the cell membrane. Red blood cells carry oxygen around the blood stream. White blood cells fight off diseases.
They can Diffuse and seperate.
Proteins control movementNucleus controls the cellsDNA makes proteins
The cell membrane,
Photosynthesis, Cellular Respiration, and the Phosphorus cycle.
Nuclear Membrane- always allows CO2 and oxygen to enter and exit, but does not allow solid objects through that do not fit through the protein channel.Passive Transport- water travels from greater to lesser with no energy being used (Osmosis)Active Transport- water travels from lesser to greater by the use of the cell's enegy
Transportatin, When protien is giving infomation to other cellinfomation when a cell is told to do somthing.the cell does it.
if the object is small enough it can fit right through the cell membrane, but if it is a larger object then it has to wait to go through the holes that open and close.
Cells conrol movement by useing flagellen and enzymes to encounter the product of movement.
Osmossis is the diffusion of water. Diffussion is moving objects through the membrane.
Active transport-Movement of molecules from an area of hugh concentration to an area of low concentration.Passive transport is two process in one. It used simple diffusion and filacated diffusion.
1.) osmosis- is the emovement of water throught the cell membrane2.) diffusion- is when more water ends up on one side of the cell membrane3.)osteoporosis
1.resperation is one way it takes substances across the cell2. food gathering also is another way when it gathers the food3. cell selection is another way they select what they want
The cell nucleus controls what goes in to the cell and comes out of it.
The nucleus holds all the nutrients.
Active transport uses energy and goes against the gradient. Diffusion moves water from a high surface area to a low surface area. Osmosis also moves water from a high surface area to a low surface area.
1.it controls the blood going through your veins2.it filters the waist products3.it helps the blood count?
PASSIVE: passive movement is where an organism or substance can get through the membrane.ACTIVE: active movement is where the thing has to go through the channel protein to enter the cell.Osmosis: water can pass easily through the membrane.
MOVES SLOW BECASE OF THE ENYZYMS
Cell membrane controls what enters and leaves the cell. Its like a security guard in the white house. The nucleus reads the information and decides if it should leave or enter the cell. The cell wall protects what enters and leaves the cell also.
The three processes used by cells are they
They would have a moving processes.
Mutation, Diversity, and Homeostastis
Three process used by the cell to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are active transport, passive transport, and a semi-permable membrane.  Active transport is the process in which the cell moves materials across its membrane with the use of energy.  Passive transport is the movement of material across the cell membrane without the use of energy.  A semi-permable membrane is what helps the cell control what pass through the cell and how it gets in.
photosynthesisosmosiswater diffusion
tRNAmitochondria
reproduction
THE CELL MEMBRANE IS THE REPRODUCION BECAUSE THIS CELL ES MOVEMEN
Passive transport moves substances without assistance across a membrane it goes from high concentration to lower ones. Active transport requires protiens to move substances asroos the cell membrane against the concentration gradient. Vesicles are 'pouches' that the cell uses to transport large particles it suronds the object and pinches it off.
Active Transport-Transport that uses energy in transporting objests across the membrane.Diffusion-Diffusion of objects across a permeable membrane.Osmosis-Movment of water across a membrane.
One process used by the cell to control movement accross the cell membrane is through energy. The cell uses its energy to control the movement across its membrane. Another way is by endocytosis. Endocytosis helps bring things into the cell. Lastly, there is exocytosis. Exocytosis is when things are being removed from the cell.
One process would be cell growth and metabolism , because to move you need to have the right metabolism so you have the energy to even move in the first place.     A second process could be protein synthesis , because you obviously need all the protein you can get to keep you moving throughout the days of hard work.      A third process is the creation of cells , this is a big part of cell movement. You cant just have one cell and expect it to do everything like move, create energy,etc.
Osmosis- Diffusion of water across a selectively permeable membrane. Cellular respiration- Diffusion of oygen in the cell.
The cell membrance have immune system to know what is coming in to your body, the atttact force that the immune system let out, and how we do thing to our body.
Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are when the cell membrane uses proteins to allow substances through the membrane, when small particles enter through the cell membrane, and when particles too large to enter the membrane through proteins use enzymes to make the particles smaller.
DiffusionOsmosisTransfusion
Endocytosis controls what is brought into the cell through the cell membrane.Exocytosis controls what is put out of the cell through the cell membrane.Soddium potassium pump contols how much sodium is left inside the cell and how much of the extra is put out of the cell. It also decides how much potassium is left outside the cell and how much of it is put inside the cell.
flagellem helps them move, cili help them move, and moving side to side or something like a motion of a snake.
Cells use three main types of processes to move substances across the cell membrane.      Type one is passive transport. This occurs when the cell dosen't use any energy to transport the materials across the cell membrane.     Type two is active transport. This occurs when the cell uses energy to transport the material across the cell membrane.     Type three is mamma mia here we go again my my how can i forget you
The three processes include tRNA, mRNA, and rRNA.
The cell membrane is controlloed by the nucleous and it goes through processes called meioses, reproduction
RNA, Vacoules, & proteins.They each move things across the cell.
Cell to cell contact,
DNA  MRNA  TRNA
Facultative diffusion- Particles moving through the protein channels from hig to low concentrationDiffusion- something moving through a cell membrane from high to low concentrationosmosis- water moving through a cell membrane from high concentration to low concentration
passive transport is what lets everything enter and leave the cell, active transport is the movement of the cell, an the nucleus is what controls everything.
The cell has has a cell membrane top control the movement. A cell also contains proteins which determine what does and does not enter the cell. And finally, the nucleus, being the brain of the cell, also controls the movement across the cell membrane.
The cell membrane is around the the cell, to protech it from every viosas from coming in the cell, also gives the cell food to eat.
osmosis
cells have cell walls. they block things from getting in and leaving. they protect them.
One, they could move all around the cell membrane and end up in nucleus.Two, they could pop out of the cell membrane and be left outside of the cell membrane.Three, they could just stay in the cell membrane.

Osmosis - Diffusion of water through the cell membrane.Active Transport - Cell uses activation energy to surround and engulf the object.Passive Transport - Cell uses no energy and lets the object pass through the cell membrane with a special protein.
First the protien comes up to the opening to pass through. Then it uses passive transport, or transport protiens to open the cell membrane and allow the protien to pass through.
1.  cells is what your body has in it so you can live2.  cells cary anything to where ever it goes3.
telophaseanophase
There are many ways a cell controls the movement if substances across the cell membrane.  One of them would be by only letting things go from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration to maintain homeostasis.  Another way is when a receptor protein is triggered to make a channel move things in or out of the cell. A third thing is when a pump is told by the nueclus to work.
Enzynes break down, Protein builds up, and everything is sent to the nucleous.
CELLS WILL EITHER ALLOW OR REJECT SUBSTANCES INTO THE CELL THROUGH ITS CELL MEMBRANE.  ONCE A SUBSTANCE IS INSIDE OF THE CELL, IT MOVES THROUGH THE CELL.  WHEN IT LEAVES THE CELL, IT LEAVES THROUGH RESPIRATION.
The Cell moves the to another place.The membrane controls where the cells go.
Cells use selective permiability to let things in and out of the cell that are smaller, and cells use transport proteins to move larger objects.
They use diffusion, to bring things in and out of the body. They use fission to move things around in the body.
The cell uses its cell membrane to monitor what goes in and out of a cell.  One processes lets substances enter the cell and one process releases substances from then cell.  They can control the movement through diffusion, which means that particles are spread apart equally inside and outside of the cell. Also the cell uses osmosis, which controls the movement of water.
Cells can use osmosis to get water across the membrane. Cells can also use diffusion. Active transport requires the cell's energy and exports things out of the membrane.
The cells move by the flow of cells, cells do their certain jobs, and cells protect the membrane.
there are thre different movements for substances in a cell.  one movement of substance is when the cell is swelling and is too full and to move it it uses a method to push the substance to another cell.  another movement is when there is less substance in a cell, causing it to shrink and it uses a method to let substances enter.  when the cell is making substance leave it is pushing against the normal flow making it harder and using  more energy. but bringing more substance in for a cell uses little to no energy at all for a cell.  the third method is when two cells are equlvalent in substance to each other and does not swell or shrink, but stays constant.
The three processes are Prophase, Metaphase, and Anaphase.
ANAPHASE PROPHASETELOPHASE
The cells use the mitochondria to move things across the cell membrane.  They also use thier golgi bodies and endoplasmic reticulum.
one way is when cells go and they start to divid and split a part to make new cells
cell devisioons and cell reproductions
Tansmitting, Copying,
Sugar cells, Tubicles, and charbohydrates
They have a cell membrane to control what comes in and out.They try to capture food.They remove things they don't need.
anaphase, telophase, prosphase
ITMBLOCKS SUBSTANCES FROM ENTERING OR LEAVING THE CELL MEMBRANE
The cell necluous sends information to the other cells to move the whole organism.
The first process used by cells to control the movement of substances acrossed the cell membrane are Ion Channels. They let only ions pass through the lipid bilayer and move along the cell. The second process that is used are carrier proteins they help carry the proteins acrossed the cell. The third way used is enzymes. They help move the substances across the cell so they can pass through the cell membrane.
Cell wall, it helps keep the substance in the membrane,
Passive transport, active transport, and diffusion.Passive transport is things leaving and entering the cell without using any energy.Active transport is using energy to move things into or out of the cell.Diffusion is when an area of higher concentration moves that substance that it is concentrated in to an area with a lower concentration.
When the something wants to get through, there is a signal sent and then a protein channel will open up and the item will get through.Some of the items that want to get through will be able to just slide through the phophilipids.Others can go through by the other proteins that will open up to let others in.
The cell may send signals to the membrane and it will go. The cell may also have helped by giving it DNA. The cell may have communicated with other cells in the organism.
1. nucleus- is the boss tells the cell what to do2. Vacuole- cleans everything up3. Mitochondria- produces energy4. mitosis- makes new cells5. Meosis- makes new sex cells

Interphase is the biging of the cell cycle where the chromatids duplicate. Anaphase the second is the stage where the nucleus dissapears. Prophase is where the sister chromatids line up in the middle of the cell.
flagellum,osmosis
One process is through the use of cyclins. Another way is through the cytoplasm. Lastly is by use of carrier protiens.
They use passive transport, active transport, and possecive transport.
reproduction,flagella,nucleus
a cell uses diffusion, osmosis ,and active transport to move substances across th e cell wall
Cells have a cell wall, which controls what goes in and out of the cell.
Cell division the movement of cells away from each other .Cell wall where the cell movement takes place and moves across the membrane.Cells use ATP to produce energy for the movement of cells.
Diffusion- liquid slowly spreads solid through liquid until it's spread out evenly (ex. powdered chocolate in chocolate milk)
hyper, hypo, osmosis.
The three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are DNA movement, respiration, and food gathering.
the membran when it go to the nuclus when the cell needs RNA
Cells have many different substances that need moving across the membrane. One process would be electron transport chain (ETC). The electron transport chain or ETC carries neutrons across the cell membrane. Another process would be active transport. Active transport is used in prokayreotes and eukaryotes. It carries waste out and carries proteins in. One last thing that cells use is diffusion. Diffusion carries everything the cells need across the cell membrane and balances the waste products.
Cell membranes are selectively permeable. This means that the phosphid bilayer, which makes up the membrane, will allow certain substances to enter and leave the cell while keeping other substances at bay.

the cell membrane is selectively permiable, and lets some supstances in but not others.  in plant cells the cell wall keeps things out of the cell.  Osmosis allows water to go into and out of the cell.
The cell is like a fillter on both sides. One side lets water and oxygen in and the other side try to kept jerms ,bactrea and other bad things out.
Osmosis is the difussion from one membrane to another.Active transport is the active use of ATP to transport materials.

1. Cells have a flagella that helps them move.2. Cells have cilla that help them move.3. Cells are forced to mve.
They slide because its slippery. Its really cramped in there because every thing is so close. Then they are molded into place and they stay there untill there job is complete.
Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are, mRNA, tRNA, and RNA
They use osmosis to go through the cell membrane using water.Cellular respiration feeds the substance through with the help of the mitochondrion. Protien synthesis goes through the membrane after the ribosomes produce them.

Protein Syntheis, Evolution, and evolving.
The cell wall has evolved over time in organisms to control movement of substances both in and out of cells.  This includes not allowing in germs or harmful bacteria, as well as putting them out, and allowing in things needed for cell function.  Also, the lysosome in a cell removes unwanted or dead proteins from a cell.  The cell membrane is a third regulatory structure of the cell, used much like the cell wall.
the three processes used by cells are diffusion, osmosis, and isotonic.osmosis is the movement of water from high to low. othrough a barrier to level the isotonic levels. diffusio is the movement of water from low to high to even out the levels of water
They move wastes through the cell.  They use cytoplasm to move stuff through cells.  They ahve holes in the cell membrane or cell wall to regulate what goes in and out.
The processes that control the movement of a substance across the cell membrane are the movement and the resperation, these help tell what is going on with the cell membrance and what kind of interactions it might come to.
they have movements that help the cell produce enought energy to move.the cells must have an energy source that will allow them to move and have a normal cell growth.while things are going past the cell membrane they have to watch for certain thigs that will allow the mto keep them safe.
They use the flagella, they divide, and multipy.

OBMOSTIST DIFIGION
Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane include the flagella, cell wall, and cytoplasm.     The flagella is a tail like attachment of a cell that allows the cell to move around.         The cell wall protects the cell and allows only specific particles in and out of it.          The cytoplasm is picky, and only allows certain materials to pass through it as well.
Osmosis, Diffusion, and Equilibrium.
1- the cells have to divide so they dont get to big. if they get to big then the process will take longer or not go all the way through2-when the cells go through the process miosis and mitois they make more cells.3- the more cells there are the healthier the membrane is
Flagellum.
-Against the flow movement that takes physical energy to move the substances-With the flow this requires no energy to to move across the surface-
Meiosis/Mitosis- The cell divides into two.Viscosity- Where water flows on the substance.
diffusion-is the movement of somthing froma higher concentration to a lower concentration.osmosis-is the movement of water from higher concentrations to lower concentrations through a membranesodium pottasium pump- the use of energy to transfer sodium and pottasium ions from lower concentrations to higher concentrations.
PHOTOSYNTHESIS, ACTIVE TRANSPORT,
The cell membrane tries to equal up the movement of substances from side to side. First the subtances flow freely through the membrane. Then, when the cell has gotten enough substances the membrane sends substances out of the cell.
CELLS USE THE CELL MEMBRAIN TO MOVE AND SOME CELLS USE THERE FLUGELAM TO SEM AND USE IT TO SWIM
transporting, reproducing, and protecting. They have to transport food all around the cell and different functions. The cells have to reproduce to make more cells to live. The cell wall protects the inside of the cell so nothing gets out.
cell wall-protects by keeping the bad stuff out.
reproduction
They use the cell wall to keep bad things out and good things in.
one way is that they cross thhe cerrebellum to get across.the second way is that it passes through the spine.and idk a third one.
Flagella- helps the cell move. Cilla- which also helps the cell move Slime on the cell wall helps the cell move.
DefenseControl Blood
The cell can use the ion channel to get ions in and out. The cell can also use the sodium potassium pump to move sodium in and potassium out. Then the last thing they can use is an enzyme. The enzymes can cause the bigger ions that can not fit though the ion channel help them move across the cell membrain so they can come in and help the cell function properly.
Selective permiability, it only allows certain things to move in and out of the cell.Homeostasis, it regulates the water balance in the cells so the cell can have an isotonic solution.
The cells verifies the substances first. Second, it opnes the wall to the accepted substance. Once the substance is through, it closes the whole and waits for another substance to come by.
It removes waste through the body. Separates good and bad materials. Lastly it fights against bad things that enter the cells.
they move with flagellas and silla
The cell has certain proteins that match up with certain substances and then lets them into the cell.Diffusion is when the cell lets a higher concentration of water move to a lower concentration of water.Osmosis is when a higher concentration of substances move to a lower concentration of substances.
They use protiens to move substances.
One use would be to remove wastes. Another use would be to recieve proteins or other necessities. Finally, it can be used to keep out harmful substances.
The nucleus controls all the cells functions The membrane controls what goes in and out of the cellThen I guess that the mitochondrian control the food intake.
The golgi body releases substances uneeded and send out of the membrane, The nucleus tells some substances where to go in the cell because that is like the brain of the cell, and also through the mitochondria which is the powerhouse of the cell, it tells some substances how to help the cell.
The cell membrane has a semi premiable membrane that only lets certain things go in and out of the cell.
Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane is flagella which helps the cell get throught the membrane, the nucleus that is the control center, and the cell wall to protect the cell from any unwanted cells or anything unwanted.

The cell membrane has holes in  it for proteins and enzymes to pass through. It also has a gate to keep unwanted molecules out. Certain molecules must become attached to the passage for the molecule to pass through. Also the cellmembrane itself does not allow  molecules to go through it unless they have the right structure for it to go through.They must diffuse across the membrane.

Three processes used by cells to contol the movement of substances across the cell membrane would be the mitochondria, nucleolous and the nucleus.
Prophase, anaphase, and metaphase
Three process used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are
Endocytosis, Exocytosis and Cellular Respiration are the three processs used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane.Endocytosis is when the substance moving across the cell membrane is brought into the cell.Exocytosis is when the substance is brought out of the cell.
1. The cell membrane blocks whatever is trying to come in until it knows that it is safe to enter the cell without doing harm.2. It helps block any unwanted subsances from passing into the cell if they got passed the cell wall.3. It can control what leaves the cell, if it is not supposed to leave, then the cell membrane or cell wall will keep it from leaving. If it is supposed to leave, it will let it pass through.
Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell inlcudes: carrying proteins to differents parts of the cell, carrying genetic information, and many other jobs and processes as well.
It is the nucleus
Osmosis, which is the process of moving substances using waterActive Transport, which is where the cells move substances across themselves, and Passive Transport, which is where the substances just pass through
osmosis,selectively permeable, and diffussion
The cellular respiration process controls the water flow throughout a cell membrane, the mRNA transports messages throughout the cell, and the tRNA produces proteins.
The three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances are the cellular tissue. This controls what goes in and out of the cell.  Then, lysosomes that control what waste leaves the cell.  Followed by, ribosomes that make proteins.
Active Transport allows substances to move across the cell membrance from low to high concentration. Active Transport uses energy.Osomis allows substances to move across the cell membrance without using energy. Therefore, moving from a high to low concentration.Diffusion allows substances to move across the cell membrane by diffusing them across the cell.
The three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are the following:1. osmosis2. meiosis3. mitosis
1. DIFFUSION 2.3.
Osmosis, difusion, and phospholipid difusion are three processes by which a substance can move across the cell membrane. Osmosis is the dirusion of a substance through a selectively permeable membrane; usually a substance such as water. difusion is the difusion of other semi-small chemicals or atoms moving across the membrane. Phospholipid difusion is the difusion of larger chemicals or atoms across a membrane with the use of a protien.
Endocytosis- The movement of large amounts of materials into the cell with the use of energy.Exocytosis- The movement of large amounts of materials out of the cell with the use of energy.Materials also move down across the concentration gradient from high density to low density without the use of energy in a cell.
ARMS.LEGS.SHOULDERS.
The cell membrane selects what can and cannot cross into the cell. There's passive somethings and active somethings in the cell membrane.

1. There are cells to transport protiens.2. There are cells to let different substances in and out of the membrane3. There are cells to transport energy.
The cells will control movement by the cell wall, the cell membrane, and the flagelluim.
Endocytosis-Stuff going into the cellExocytosis-Stuff being excreted from the cellOsmosis-Movement of water through a cell
The first process is possessing a passive transport. This allows certain substances to pass through the membrane without using energy and others are stopped. The second process is osmosis. This is the transfer of water through the cell membrane. The Third process is facilitated diffusion in which energy is used to move molecules across the membrane.
Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are mRNA rRNA and tRNA.
Water is moved by osmosis.Insulin is moved by fitting into receptors on the cell membrane to make it open, like a lock and key.Any other nutrients are moved by diffusion.
Osmosis- movement by water
Gelate, Genome, Ganglian
Diffusion is used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane.  Substances transfer from high concentration to low concentration.  Active transport is also used.  ATP is important in taking the substances across the membrane.  ATP allows the substances to go against the concentration gradient.  Protein carriers also control movement of substances.  Protein carriers go through a distinct process to engulf the substance and then release it back in or out of the cell.  All of these are examples of different ways cells control the movement of substances across the membrane.
the cell process controls what enters and leaves tthe cell membrane. it helps control the movement and helpoi t function better
1.Osmosis lets certain things pass through water.2. Diffusion pushes things out of the cell.3. Also by being selectively permeable and only letting certain things enter the cell.
Facilitated diffusion- is a way that substances move from one form of concentration to another form of consintration, diffusion- it takes substances from an area of high concentration to low consintraion, osmosis- deals with the water bieng moved
Well the cell have to move though the membrane to the chain of reaction.
The cells divide. 23 chromosomes for a male and 46 chromosomes for a female. Mitosis and meiosis take place in the function of a cell. And enzymes help proteins to be made. Diploid is all 46 chromosomes. Haploid is half and that is only 23.
miosis, mitosis, and interphase
Interphase, Anaphase, Telophase
The concentration gradient moves things throught the cell pushing them although exocytosis uses its own energy to push things, such as waste, out of the cell.
Osmosis- The diffusion of materials through water particlesActive transport- Moves materials by using energyPassive transport- Moves materials without using energy
Transcription.
Cells have a lipid bilayer which helps to move things through the cell membrane. A cell's membrane is selectively permeable. Cells also use passive and active transport. Passive transport requires no energy. Some form of passive transport include osmosis, diffusion, and facilitated diffusion. Active transport, unike passive, reguires energy to move things through the cell membrane.
CELLS USE THE ORGANELLES TO HELP MOVE THINGS. THEY OFTEN HAVE MANY DIFFERENT WAYS TO MOVE THINGS. THEY ALSO USE THE SMOOTH AND ROUGH ENDOPLASMIC RETICULUM.
MITOCHONDRIA - STORES AND RELEASES ENERGY.NUCLEUS - CONTAINS ALL THE INFORMATION NEEDED FOR THE CELL TO FUNCTIONRESPIRATION - TAKE IN NUTRIENTS AND RELEASES WASTES
cell wall--allows things to move in and out of the cellcell membrane--Protects the nucleusmotochondria--It duplicates
A chain is the process used by cells to move something across the cell. The chain passes it from one to another and so on. Another way is when the phosphates that have two tails and a head keep things out of the cell. This makes the substances bounce back. Enzymes speed up the process.
1) water is carried throughout the cell

1) Cellular Respirtaion 2)
Osmosis- controls amount of water in the cell.
the size of the holes in the membrane. the flow of cytoplasm. the size of the substance trying to move through the organism.
Translation, Transcription,
lipids allow water to pass out of the cell, but not into it.oxygen is allowed to pass through the cell membrane, but not other gases.
transportation is where the cell transports proteins and sugars. transcription is where the cell rads what kind of protein or sugar its dealing with. Transformation is when they transform into bigger cells.
Active transport:  It is used by the cell membrane to transfer items throughout the cells.  The cell membrane decides if the items can pass through the cell or not.  Distribution: The cell membrane will also use distribution to decide what items go to each part of the cell and how much will be sent to the organelles.  These items could be things like water or other fluids.Seperation: The cell membrane can decide at any time what to seperate in a cell or out of the cell.  It can split up ribosomes or keep fluids from entering the cell.  The cell membrane is the main protector of the cell.
The cells can be carried through th blood stream.
To control the movement of substances across the cell membrane, the cell uses various different structures and processes the monitor this, such as the golgi apparatus.
homeostacios
The cell can use what is called cellular respiration, or it could use where the substances move across the top of the membrane in a gel like substance.
Diffusion
The cell membrane regulates what goes in and out of the cell.
1.) Diffusion: the movement of substances from an area of higher concentration into an area of lower concentration2.)Endocytosis: process by which materials are moved into the cell3.)Exocytosis: process by wich materials are moved out of the cell.
osmosis-transports wateractive transport- transports proteinsdiffusion-
Three processes used by cells to contol the movement of substances across the cell membrane are diffusion, transprt by proteins and the cytoplasm.
passive transportactive transport
The cell uses osmosis to move water in or out of the cell. It uses diffusion to move other things in and out of the cell and it uses takes things in and out of the cellur membrane because it is semi permeable.
Osmosis- The process by which water is moved from a high leel of concentration to a low one. This is used by the cell to keep a constant water level.Active Transport- This requires energy to be used by the cell to get materials into the cell. proteins help act as movers and there are other carbohydraye structures that recognize the materials when they arrive at the cellPassive Transport. This is when the cell does not require energy to move. Material just flow through the cells pores.
Photosynthesis- where the plant uses the suns energy to get their foodCellular Respiration- where the plant uses the rain and human nature to live
Difusion is where gases move across the cell from highest concentration to lowest ceoncentration.Osmosis which is when water diffuses through a membrane from highest concentration to lowest concentration.
osmosismeosismitosis
The first process is when the ribosomes collect all of the substances to take it in the cell. The other process is when the ribosomes takes the substances out. The third is when a virus injects its protein in the cell.
Ribosomes can move things across the cell membrane, and the plasma membrane and the cytoskeloton help make it easier for things to move that need to.
meiosis mitosis photosynthesis
PMAT helps regulate the cells.
1. Diffusion - Substances diffuse into the cell by moving from a place of high concentration to a low concentrated area.2. The movement of substances from a low concentration to a high concentration have to use energy in the cell from the mitochondria.3. The cell expells wastes from the cell membrane such as broken down parts of foreign materials by breaking them up by the ribosomes so they can be transferred through the membrane and expelled as quick as possible.
The cell membrane controls what enters and exits the cell. The RNA and proteins help control the movement of substances across the cell membrane.
passive transport allows things to move freely across the cell membraneactive transport move objects like waste out of the cellcarrier protiens carry nutrients to the cell
Osmosis
The three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are mitosis, meiosis, and photosynthesis.
cell wall, cell membrain, white cells
Osmosis,cell walls,and nucleotides
The cell wallplasma membrane
-Nucleus allowing substances to enter through the membrane.-Cell membrane allowing substances through-Proteins leaving the membrane.
1.water for movement2. food for energy to move3. brain tells the thing what to do
difusion,
The three processes have to do with proteins going to the ribosomes and then having to go into the nucleus to produce energy. The last and final step is that after the proteins have been used they then need to combine with another nucleotide.
cells help things move through the body so that they can get to the places they need to be.cells store nutrienrtsthey store food
Three types of processes used by cells to control the movement of substances are Osmosis.
Organisms enter the cell membrane, helps it with the cell, and leaves the cell membrane.
Diffusion-Water molecules move across the membrane.Cell Membrane-Controls substances that pass through it.Nucleus-Decides which substances can go through the membrane.
-Fission;  The incoming substances fuse with the cell membrance and enter the cell.-Lipids;  Substances go through the membrane through hole-like structures.-Packaging;  A substance goes into the membrane, which encases the substance.  Then the package is dumped inside the cell.
The cell could have the cell membrane, cell wall, and the cells outer edges that protect them from one another.
Cell difusion, cell reproduction, cell osmosis
GOES WITH OTHERE MOVEMENT.IT USES A TAIL.HAS A WAY
The cells use the cell wall and the nucleus.
Three processes used by cells to control movement across the cell membrane are active transport, passive transport, and the electron transport chain. Active transport uses energy. Passive transport does not require energy. the electron transport chain moves electron across the cell membrane.
diffusion, osmosis, active transport
Osmosis is the passing of water through the cell membrane. Through osmosis, water can freely pass through the membrane. Diffusion is the passive transport of substances through the cell membrane. In passive transport, substances can freely pass through the membrane without requiring energy from ATP.Active transport is the passing of substances through the cell membrane through transport systems. These require ATP for energy to pass the substances through the membrane.
the flagellum, psudapod and the phylopod
The three processes are diffusion, osmosis, and polymerization.
THE CELL WALL HELPS KEEP TRACK OF WHAT ENTERS AND LEAVES THE CELL.

some cells just going right throught it. But not all the cells can go through it. its in between white and red cells. Plus they have to go through the cell wall.
1) Chromosomes2) Nuclearus3) Membrane
The cell uses osmosis to even out the concentration gradient.The cell uses a solute pump to move substances across the membrance.The cell uses endocytosis to remove items from the cell membrane.
Active transport(uses energy), facillitated diffusion(doesn't use energy), and a process where the cell opens up a saclike structure and engulfs he substance using energy)
Osmosis: movement of water through the cell membraneDiffusion: movement of water and solutes through the cell membrane
Nucleous is the main part of the cell more likely the brain of the cell.Ribosomes are then created by the Nucleous there job is to make the proteins for the cell.Proteins are created by the Ribosomes which then are used to give energy for the cell so it can move and start the processes all over again.
1)flagella to make the cell move.
Osmosis is the movement of particles from two different sides of the membrane using hypertonic and hypotonic forces.Diffusion if the natural movement of substances across the cell membrane.Facilitated diffusion requires cell energy. This type of diffusion is used for particles that are two large to pass through the cell membrane. Their are protein channels made for specific substances to pass through opening and closing like a trap door.
The cell wall helps contain the cells shape, it gathers waste to the cell membrane and it helps function it.
reprodution                    cytokenisiscelluar respitory
To control the movement of substances across the cell membrane, they use diffusion. Diffusion is the process in which things from a high concentration, move to an area of low concentration.
They use their oganrellse to move substances across the cell, they also use diffusion to move substances across the cell
The cell membrane uses energy to let certain things in and keep certain things out. the cell wall helps keep things out of the cell. they can also use diffusion.
endocytosis- process by which materials move into the cell.exocytosis-process by which matrials move out of the cell.solute pumping-
Cell Wall- Makes the plant cell stiff but also keeps out unwanted items or organismsCell Membrane- Lets things in and out of the cell with permission from the nucleus and Chloroplast- Help the plants maintain energy
three processes that cells use to control movement is active transport which uses energy to go against the current, passive transport which requires no energy because is goes with the current, and transport protiens which carry substances through and across the membrane.
One of the three processes is deleation, deleation is where it takes one of the cells away. The second of the three is replication, that is where one of the cells are replicated. The last process is called translation, translation is where you take one thing from another cell and add it to the existing cell.
ProteinsLipidsTransitions
Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrance are mRNA, tRNA, and rRNA.
The fisrt process is prophase.  The cytoms go to the opposite ends of the cell membrain.  The second form of process is Metaphase.  It Puts all of the chromosomes in the middle and lines them up.  The last process is called Telophase.  It seperates the chromosomes and pulls them to the oposite ends of the cell membrane and seperates the cell into two new cells.
A process that moves substances across the cell membrane is osmosis, the diffusion of water.  Another is diffusion, having more water in one part of the cell membrane than the other part.
InterphaseTelophaseAnaphase
Cells control the movement by carrying the information to other parts of the cell.
INTO A CELL- SO THAT THE INFORMATION CAN BE PROSESSED.OUT OF A CELL- SO THAT IT CAN GET RID OF WASTE.SHARED- SO THAT IT CAN RELATE INFORMATION.
protine pump, membrane pores, phosphate pump

They have got flagella to help them move around the cell.
osmosis- passing through waterdiffusion- through the cellactive energy- requires energy
The mitochondiria produce and shoot out energy for the cell.The lipids carry things across.Cytoplasm allows things to manuver across.
1. Division- the cells divide so they don't become too big to move the stubstances.2.removing the waste so it doesn't build up in the cell creates more room to move needed substances3.lipids regulate the movement
The three processes on which cells use to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are respiration, homeostasis, and the lipids going through the cell membrane being able to go in and out.
the blood flow     the size of the cell to make it though the vansalso they need to be strong to fight off bacteria
1. Cell membrane-regulates what comes into cell and what is released from cell2.Natural Diffusion-things such as oxygen and water can naturally diffuse across the membrane3.Mitochondria-helps transport nutrients in the cell
One process is organelles.Another process is transportation.The last process is checkpoints.
One process by which cells move substances across the membrane is the movement of RNA. Two is the movement of energy and three is the organeles send messages to the nucleus to control the movement.
Three processes used by cells include: the cell membrane, cell wall, and cholorplasts.
The cells use the Endoplasmic Reticulum to move protiens. The cells uses mRNA to carry messages. The cells use the Flagella to move the cell itself.
movement, repridouction, respirtaion
Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane could be diffusion, osmosis, and cellular transport. These cells move themselves through the membrane either through or around it.
Cilia- Hair like structures that cover the organism, the friction of the hairs moving allows the organism to moveFlagellum- A long whip like structure is wiggled and the organism moves.
three processes are tRNA mRNA and rRNA and those trafer thing throught the membrane of the cell to synthesize proteins
The cell has holes in the membrane that allows substances to enter into the cell.The cell will reject any foreign substances from entering.
Osmosis- water trasnsferProtein Channels- tubbules that channel protiens through the membraneCell membrane- limints what come in and outof the cell
Cell differentiationdifusion
One way to control the movement of substances arcoss the membrane is the stomata. This controls how much materials go into and out of the cell by opening and closing. Another way to control the movement is by diffusion. Some water goes into the cell while other go away. cellular respiration also helps the movment of substances.
translocation, inversion, deletion
photosynthisis
They remain cosentrated because the passing-over cells are useing either a psedopod, flagella, or cillia have to cross over the cell membrane where it is less consentrated.
Difusion, and osmosis. Difusion is the movement of water through a permeable membrane.
1. Active Transport is when a cell in your body work and use engery to  aloow things in and out of your cells. 2. Passive Transport is when your cell do not use engery but allow things in and out of your body such as water. 3.diffusion when
1.It closes the membranes that transfer sugars and other liquids.2.It shrinks.3.It swells.
The three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances acrossed the cell membrane are removal of wastes, bringing in of nutriantes, and the cells growth.
Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are reprodution which is making new cells, transcription, which sends messages and translation which spells out what the message was pretty much.
The cell membrane controls wats goes in and out the cell. So the cell membran knows how to prevent future problems so the cell will stay stable.
One movement process is called osmosis.  This process is when water is transported across the cell membrane.  Another process is called facilitated diffusion.  That is when the channel proteins control what go in and out of a cell. The third process is called diffusion.  This is when particles can go in and out of a cell membrane.
The cell uses the movement of the liquid to move
The processes used by cells to control the movement of substance across the cell membrane by meiosis. They let the cell move or the cell would have a flagella.
the plasme membrane has a lower concentration on matter inside of the cell than what there is outside of the cell, the plasma membrane has 'holes' in it so it will only let in a certain amount of matter and a certain size, osmosis, active transport, passive transport.
Three substances that are used ny cells to control the movement is the mitochondrion and the sticky substance that everything is placed in; chlorofil. They also use the MRNA and RNA as messengers.
The cell can use endocystosis, which brings in nutrients and proteins from the outside by wrapping the cell membrane around it. They can also use exocystosis, which puts objects out nutrients and proteins by releasing them in a bubble. There is also the transport protein which allows small nutrients to pass through the membrane.
Tell informaton, mRNA, tRNA,
1. The nucules tell what to do2. Tansports the protein to the mitoconderen3. The mitoconderen turns it into energy
They control the flow of the substances.
diffusion is when the cell moves things across the cell membrane but it doesnt require energy to do so. active transport has to use energy to move across the cell because it moves against a current type substance that makes it harder to get across . Osmosis is when the cell moves a substance over the cell membrane using a little bit of energy.
Movement, so they can get place to place
Cells use there selective membranes to decide what goes in and out of a cell.Cells use active transport which is moving things acrosss the concentration granite.Cells use passive transport which moves things with the concentration granite.

RECEPTER ROTIENCE ONLY LET SERIAN THING THROUGH, CHANNEL PROTIENCE LET THINGS THROUGH THER CELL WALL. SMALLER THINGS CAN ALOS GO THROUGH THE WALL
one of the processes is by
In cells, their plasma mebrain, also know as the cell membrain, is used for most of tbe cells function. The plasma membrain aids in how the cell moves. Also, the plasma membrain also controlls how cells take in food, and how the excrete waist. The plasma membrain, also helps keep the cell its shape.
cilia- moves cellcytoplasm-keeps the organelles in cellflagellum-moves cell
metaphase,prophase,anaphase
Diffusion is used by cells to allow substances to enter the cell
Cells use organelles to move things around it. there are 2 of things that can be used to move it throughout the cell. they are the smooth and rough Endoplasmic Reticulims
Active transport-requires energyPassive transport- requires no energyosmosis- the movement of water from one place to another
One process would be mitosis and another would be meiosis.  A diffrent process would be respiration.
The three types of movements are diversion, equilibrium, and distrubition. Diversion is the process of one substance passing through the membrane. Equilibrium is the process of balancing the concentration on both sides of the membrane. Distribution is the process of moving two different substances to opposite sides of the membrane.
Cell WallRibosomesFlagellum
defustion lets things in and out of the membrane. Osmois lets water in and out of the membrane.
meiosis and mitosis. they control what the cell does and where it goes.
Chemical reactionmitosis- reproduction of cellmiosis
Three processes used by cells to control the movement of sunbstances across the cell membrane are mRNA, tRNA, and RNA
1.  The cell can use transport proteins, which are always open to any and all sbstances that fit.2.  The cell can use a recognition protein with a carbohydrate chain on it to keep viruses and other harmful stuff from getting inside of the cell.3.  The cell can use receptor proteins that only allow substances that fit in the exact shape, (etc...), inside the cell... these do not allow harmful things inside of the cell.
One way is by osmosis. Osmosis is when cells transport water across the cell membrane. Another way is protien channels. The channels transport big objects across the membrane.
the cell membrane sends the a message to another part of the cell membrane. then it sends the substances threw tubes.
the three processes would be reproduction,respiration,and food gathering.
diffusion, exocysitosis, and endocitosis. Exocysotosis moves things out of the cell and endocytosis moves things into the cell. Diffusion moves water into and out of the membrane.
cells use diffusion to move liquids from one area to another. cells use a selective permeable membrane to allow certain materials to leave and enter the cell.
cell membrane cell wall and cytoplasm
Diffusion is the process in which something moves from a part of low concentration to Higher Concentration or High to low.Binary fission is the process of moveing something across a permeable membrane.Osmosis is moving water across a semi-permeable membrane.
glycolosis, krebs cycle,electron transport chain
1. the smooth ER-transfors stuff to the nucles2. the rough ER-takes stuff from yhe nucles3. the golgie-makes ribosomes
Cells use their cell walls to stop harmful substances. They also use their flagellum to control the movement across the cell membrane.
osmosis, diffusion, mitosis
1) Cells have cytoplasm in order for them to be able to move throughout the cell.2) The nucleus controls what happens in the cell.3) The endoplasmic reticulum takes things out of the nucleus.
One form of getting around ould be using a flagellum or tail like structure that enables the cell to move around. Another form is cilla or small tiny hairlike structures that are on the outside of the cell that help the cell move around my grabbing onto things and puling it's slef. Amother way is like in your body, you heart pumps the bood through your blood stream with out any of the stuuctures like a flagellum or cilla. Enabling it to move around.

three processes used by cells to move substances across the cell mambrane are:1) Active Transport2)3)Difussion
It has molecules that glide across the inside to watch out for bad things and to put things that cross over out that shouldnt get in. The cell aslo has molecules that protect itself from bad things.
The cell can suck food in, can spit it out, and can hold it in place with the membrane.
it controls the movement by
There are three types of ways that cells move substances across the concentration gradient. There is a type of diffusions where cells have holes in them that allow things to pass through there membrane. There is a type of diffusion where a cell moves around and engulfs things and there is a type of diffusion where the cells have both holes and they engulf things.
endocytocis, exocytocis, ion channels
cell membrane, protein, and feniues
endocytosis is particles going into the cellexocytosis ss particles going out of the cellosmosis is water moving in and out of the cellpenocytosis is small and liquid particles going into the cellphagocytosis is large particles going into the cell
Passif of transport.
Meiosis and Miosis is the passing of materials through membranes in a cell.The digestive track allows for materials to be released at certain points of time to allow no back up
The 3 processes cells use to controll movement would be, the physoplic biolayer which knows what goes in and out of the cell, then phosphates send the message about the movement and then the orgenelles inside move from one place to another.
The cell membrane only allows certain materials intop the cell, by guarding the wall.
1. Photosynthesis     2. Cell Respiration     3. Mitosis
Endocytosis (which is part of active transport), where the cell uses energy to pull items through the selectively permeable membrane.Exocytosis (part of active transport), the cell uses energy to push items out of the cell.Diffusion (part of passive transport), the cell does not use energy to gain the items it wants but lets the items move through the selectively permeable membrane.
The cell movements are:
prokaryotes, ukaroyotes, ribosomes
THEY MOVE IN LITLE GORPS AND EAT BATREA AND CAN REPORDUCE ASEXUALLY
The cell membrane is a jelly like substance.
Meiosis, Mitosis, and Oserosis
The cell membrane keeps in nutrients and things that are vital for the cell to live.  It also pushes stuff out, such as waste, that is not necessary or could be harmful to the cell.  Lastly, the cell membrane acts as a protector to protect the cell from anything that could possibly harm or damage it.
One process is active transport, which is transport with the aid of transport proteins. Transport proteins help to get the substances to move through the plasma membrane. Another process is passive transport, which is not very differet from active transport, except this transport does not use the aid of transport proteins. The substances move without them.A third process is exocytosis or endocytosis.Exocytosis is the secreting or expelling of unwanted materials or wastes.Endocytosis is the surrounding and engulfing of materials.
MrnaDNARNATrna
a cell uses the plasma to hold all of the organelles in place.
SOME CELLS USE FLAGELAM FOR MOVEMENT
The cell wall processes the movement in and out of the cell.
The substance go through the membrane,
Different parts of the cell control the movement of substances across the cell membrane.  The nucleus carries out genetic information such as DNA to the rest of the cell.  The mitochondrian transport energy throughout the cell.  The cytoplasm allows this movement to take place throughout the cell as well.
Cells are the basic unit of all living things. Cells have numerous functions such as fighting off infections when they enter out body. They also transport information all over our body. They let the rest of our bodies know what they're suppose to do. Cells also keep us living and breathing.
they use movement.
Cells carry information to other cells. Cells push out unwanted or unnecessary materials from the body.Cells created other cells.
Everything that leavess or enters the cell goes through pore membranes.Photosynthesis helps give nutrients to plants by absorbing light and carbon dioxide and makes sugar for the plant.
Diffusion, allows the flow to be controled. Osmosis lets water in while the surface area decreases.
the cell membrain only let certain stuff in to the nucleus.

Cells use diffusion to get materials through the cell membrane. They also use osmosis to get water in and out of the cell. Some also use facilitated diffusion which uses energy to move things.
Cell DivitionCell ReproductionCell Movement
There are certain cell organelles that controll what goes in and out of the cell. Also substances are moved in and out of the cell by diffusion. Another way is cells are able to controll how much of sometimes goes in or out of the cell
Cells are the primary block in life and are responsible for for the many complex things that we do . Cells make tissue that make organs that make organ systems .
Diffusion, meioses.
They use Flagelates, pseudopods, or cilia.
Cells have a cell membrane that controls the movement of substances that come in and out of the cell. Also, the surface area plays a roll in controlling the movement of substances aswell. Along with the cell membrane and the surface around, the volume of the cell also has a part in controlling the movement of substances. If the surface area of a cell is bigger than the volume of a cell, it will make it difficult for things to move across the cell. It is the same as if the volume is larger than the surface area.
prophase, anaphase, telophase
There is a process called osmosis to move substances in and out of cells. Cells also have proteins that move substances around the membrane. Lastly, cells use channel proteins, which channel energy.

They move the cells.They keep them were the need to be.
One process the cell uses to move substances across the membrane, is through the nucleus. The Nucleus of a cell contains genetic material called DNA which tells the cell which processes to do, this process includes movement across the cell.  Secondly, The cell membrane in general is a regulator of what can and cannot enter and exit the cell.  Last of all, in the process of transfering DNA to other parts of the cell, mRNA moves across the cell to ribosomes, in order for the DNA to be processed and used for a specific cause. This example is a more specific way that shows how cells control movement within the membrane.
The cytoplasm helps regulate what comes in and outThe cell wall controls what leaves and comes inRibosomes carry proteins throughout the cell
The cell membrane desides what can go into the cell and what can't.
Osmosis, diffusion, and Equilibrium.
the nucleus tells where each individual needs to go.
Cells can use osmosis which is the diffusion of water across a cell membrane.Cells can use facilitated diffusion which is the movement of particales across a membrane.Cells can use passive or active transport. Active has to do with proteins on the membrane called channel protein, this uses energy.  Passive transport does not use channel proteins, nor does it use energy.
They use one process where it just glides across the cell.One process is used to carry it over.And one process is used to slide it across the cell. Transcription Translation and Transversion
The cellular membrane stops unwanted materials from getting into the cell. The nucleus decides what it wants inside of the cell.The cytoplasm slows untwanted materials so they can be killed.
THE GOLIGI APPERTIUS
Though the electron transport chain.
The tree processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are Blood flow going to the cells, Oxygen flow, and nutrients flow.
One process to move particles across a membrane is osmosis. Osmosis is moving water across a membrane. There is hypertonic osmosis, which is moving water out, hypotonic, which is moving water in, and isotonic which is equal water moving in and out. Another process is using a protein channel. The protein channel can move substances across a thick membrane of lipids. Another process if diffusion, which is moving particles from high concentration to low concentration.
flagella: is a long tail, cilia: little hair like things,

DifutionActive transportelectron transport
Cells use chloroplasts to absorb nutrients and it is used as an organizer for transporting substances through out the cell. Cells also use the mitochondria to move substances. The mitochondria is like the cells organizer, it balances out the substances and sends them where they need to go.
One way the cell controls the movement across the membrane is by knowing where to go. Aniother way is by swimming to where it needs to go, and the last way i moves is by just moving there.
Cells can use the process of osmosis which has water pass through its barrier. A second process is diffusion. Lastly, a third process is facilitated diffusion.
PHOTOSYNTHESISFLAGELLUM
Passive Transport-where no energy is needed for the transportation of things in or out of the cell.Active Transport-where energy is required for the transportation of things in or out of the cell.Endocytosis-the process where the cell surrounds sumthing and brings it into the cell because it is to big to travel through one of the channels.

They use translation, transcription, and replication.
When a substance tries to move into a cell, the cell mebrane is selective in what it alows. The cell membrane is selectively permeable, meaning it only allows what it wants into and out of the cell. Also, substances try to connect with different protiens on the cell membrane. If they are not the right substances and protiens, they will not be allowed through the barrier.
Osmosis is where water helps move things in and out of the cell. Active transport is when energy is used to move the substances across the cell membrane.Passive transport is when energy is not used to move the substances across the cell membrane.
MITOSISMEIOSISINTERPHASE

The three processes that are used by the cells to move across the cell membrane are diffustion, osmosis, and active transport.
The three processes that the cell uses to conrol the movement across the cells are the movement of the lipid, nuclies, and another process.
cytoplasm is used to move particles throughout the cell.the flagella is used like a tail on a cell for movement.and the cillia are little hairs used for movement in the cell to move particles across the cell membrane.
Three processes used by cells to control the movement of substances across the cell membrane are osmosis, facilitated diffusion and active transport. Osmosis is the diffusion of water across a semi-permiable membrane. Facilitated diffusion is the diffusion of a large molecule across a semi-permiable membrane that requires help, such as transport protiens. Active diffusion is the diffusion of a molecule that requires the use of energy.
Flagella are used for movement by the cell. Cellular Respiration is a processed used by the cell to breathe. Mitosis is another process used by the cell to reproduce.
nucleuscell membrane
The plasma membrane is selectivly permeable.  It lets oblects in or out of the cell.  Diffusion lets objects move through the plasma membrane along the concentration gradient, without the need for energy.  Facilitated diffusion lets objects too big to fit through the plasma membrane enter the cell through transport proteins without the need for energy.  Active transport lets objects enter the cell against the concentration gradient through protiens.

Rose wants to help the family but feels weighed down that there is too much pressure on her to do well and help Paul with college
Rose can be described by the trait of responsability. This is shown because she has a job, but still manages to do her homework. This can be very hard to do sometimes but she is responsible enough to do it.
Rose is thoughtful and caring.  She has plenty of topics or activities in her life that she could be complaining about; however she puts others before herself.       For example in the story Aunt Kolab asks Rose if the work she does to help the family 'weighs her down'.  Rose did not want to tell her the truth because she did not want to hurt her aunt.  Therefore, one can see Rose cares about others emotions and can be characterized as thoughtful.
One trait that describes Rose is understanding. When she was talking to Anna, Anna was saying that she is lonesome for Papa and that it feels like he has been gone for years. Rose understands that even though it hurts his family emotionally, Papa had to take the job in Los Angeles to give his family a better life. She says to Anna that it has only been four months since he left and that he gets paid three times what he was making there.
She feels weighed down by helping the family and doesn't really want to do all she is doing anymore, but she also doesn't want anyone to know how she feels because she doesn't want to hurt her family. ''Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.'
Rose is a tired hard working girl. When she talks to her sister she is serious, and when her and her aunt talk her aunt respects her because she has had her days like her before.
Based on her conversation with Anna, Rose comes across as understanding. She explains to Anna that even though it's hard on them, they each have their part to do for the family in order to help during difficult times. This shows that she understands the families struggles and realizes they need her help. Even though she feels slight resentment for this, she surpresses these feelings while explaining the situation to Anna because she understands thatn the family needs them to help out.
Rose conversations were based on there trait there are all from cambodia
One trait that can describe Rose is that she is stressed. You can tell that she is stressed because in the beginning of the story she tells you that her day, like most of her days, had been too long and too demanding. She had gone from school straight to the restaurant, then home to help with dinner and then to do her homework.
One trait would be that she is smart and is a hard woker because she is in a contest were she has to write a three thousnad word essay and she stiil had to go to work.
The time Rose was talking to Anna about why thier dad had to leave because of a job. She says 'He had to go. The job in LA paid better then what he was making here.'
Rose is a very optimistic person. In her conversation with Anna, Rose always looks at things as if they were for the better and that they will have a good outcome. When they are talking about their father who moved away to get a better job Anna is complaing about how they never get to see him anymore but Rose is looking at it from the other point of view, that he did it to get more money to help support his family and to send his girls to college.
she is caring she doesnt want to tell her aunt because she is  afraid she is going to make her feel bad.
Rose is pressured.  She reveals this trait as she talks about the dream she has, and in the fact that she does not answer her aunt when Rose is asked by her if she feels weighted down by all she does to help her family.
Rose is sweat and wouldn't want to hurt anyone, like Anna. She was being nice to her and telling her the good things about what they are doing and she is putting her bad feelings behind her to make her sister happy.
Anna was trying to help sounding like their mother because their mother didnt get off work until late and Rose had doosed off while she was trying to write her state essay to win for.
'You sound just like Mama.' it was when Anna and Rose were talking in the kitchen
One trait that Rose has is that she is understanding. When Anna says that money isn't everything, Rose explains to Anna that money is everything when you already have everything. Rose is trying to make Anna understand that her family is just trying to help them out.
Anna glared at Rose.'Money isn't everything.'     'Only if you have everything,' Rose said. She tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her. 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job; Anna; and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
One trait that can descirbe Rose is responsible. It seems like she is responsible for so much in her and her families life. For example, when she has to work her work shift and help her Aunt Kolab in paragraph 2.
One trait that Rose has is selflessness. I know this because when she is talking to Anna and Anna tells her how she is feeling Rose responds with, 'He had to go. The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here.' She is feeling overwhelmed but does not mention it to her sister.
Based on Rose's attitude from the story, she seems like she cares a lot about her family, but is also worried about her family. Even though she seems worried or doubtful, one line in the story she says to her sister, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.' In this sentence, it sounds like she has a little bit of faith also.
I think shes just feelin alot of pressure with all that shes doing. so the trait i think she has is patience. She's always waiting onand helping others. One detail from the story that shows me this is, when it sasys, 'The day, like most of her days, had been to long, too demanding. From school she'd gone straight to the resturaunt to work a four hour shift, then straight home to help aunt kolab prepare a quick supper.'She's always helping others, and i think that means she has patience.
From her conversations, Rose seems to be a caring individual, in the way that she tried to comfort Anna and in her kind and gentle behavior towards Aunt Kolab when asked if this lifestyle was difficult. She cares about her family enough to work a job to help support the family and send her brother to college and seems to be caring enough to help carry the entire family.
Rose is grateful. She is willing to help the family whenever it is needed. She is willing to get a job and helped pay for her college education and also Anna's, her younger sister. In the story it says in a different way that she is proud of her heritage and how she lives.
In the story Rose is a very giving person. She tries to help pay for her brothers college and do an essay to receive a prize. She works all the time just to help her brother. That is why she is a very giving person.
She is steadfast in her loyalty to her family.  Even though she is tired of working, homework and her essay she keeps on going.  She is hoping her life will get better.
One trait that can describe Rose is that she is responsible.  'The day, like most of her days, had been too long, too demanding.  From school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper.  After that it was time to do homework.'  This shows that Rose has a lot of things to do and makes sure she takes care of everything.
One trait that can describe Rose is thoughtful. Rose is thoughtful because in the story she is trying to help her sister understand that their father had take the other job for the money.
Rose and Anna both want their mom and dad to stop working so late at night and Rose thinks that Anna should try and find out if she could get some time off work to do her work from school.
One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations is that she is caring. Rose cares for her sister and family, even to the point where she will hide her true feelings to make her sister feel better. When Rose was having a converstaion with Anna, she spoke gentely trying to word her sentences to make it seem that it was not that big of deal that their dad was gone. Based on her converstation with Anna, Rose seems to be a thoughtful and caring person.
Rose is a caring person.  In paragraph 4, when Anna wakes up from having a bad dream, Rose tries her best to comfort her sister.  She speaks in a gentle voice, so as not to increase the despair that her younger sister is feeling. While speaking to Anna, Rose displays this specific character trait.  Anna was not completely satisfied with Rose's answer, but she still was able to go back to sleep.  In this, I think Rose shows the readers that she is indeed a caring person.
If i had to show one trait from Rose it would be based the conversation with Anna. Traits I can see from this conversation is she is in a way nieve.
Rose is a very hardworking girl it seems like. She has alot on her shoulders. She just needs to take a break an chill for a little while.
One trait I can describe Rose as having is, she thinks that she does everything for the family. And that she is sick of doing it. In the story it says, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what your doing to help this family?' 'Rose didnt answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.'
It appears she tends to feel as if she is living in her brothers shadow, that if she doesnt amount to him she isnt going to be good enough.
She's optimistic, in paragraph 23 (sentence 1-2) it says, 'Rose kept nodding. Maybe her life would get easier.
Rose feels tied down by what she is doing to help her family. In her dream
Rose is upset, because she is trying hard to keep her family happy, and there is always so much to do. Rose's sister gets upset when they start talking about their father being gone.
Rose is caring. The part where her aunt asks her is she feels weighed down because of her family, Rose did not want to answer because she felt it would hurt her Aunts feelings.
The first trait that Rose exemplifies, is the trait of expressing someones feelings. One example, when Rose trys to explain to Anna about her dad getting a better job for them to go to college and actually getting something out of life. Another, example is when Rose expresses how she feels about Cambodian her first country and how she wishes it would be just like that.
Rose seems like a very compassionate young girl that truely wants to help her family throughout their time of need. 'From school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four-hour shift, then stragiht home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper.' She helped out her family so much even though the stress was weighing down on her.
Rose seems shes got an anger issue,She stood up and stalked out of the kitchen.
her younger sister walked in rubing her eyes and rose said what is wrong
Caring 'Anna' 'what's wrong ?' 'you feel ok?'
One trait that describes Rose is that she is respectful and respects what her brother has done for their family at such a young age by sticking up for him in her conversation with Anna.
Rose is scared of hurting her aunt by telling the truth.
She is stressed she is constantly thinking and feeling overwhelmed
Rose is a very compassionate and caring person. While both she and her younger sister are discouraged she still tries to make light of the situation to make her sister feel better although she is struggling internally.
One trait that is used by Rose in the story is her support.  Alothough Rose has school, work, and a 3,000 word essay to write, and cooking to do, she is still working hard to support her brother Paul.  Even though she feels weighed down by the crammed schedule, she is still working her four-hour shift at a restaurant after school.
Rose is lonesome just like her sister Ana, but she doesn't shoe it and only tells Ana that thier father is gone to get money to make their lives better.
Frusraited, because in the conversation she has a tone of just cramming things in, and that she cant do it.
stressed from everything
I think Rose is accountable. During her talk with Anna, she interupts her own schedule to talk to Anna and comfort her after she has a bad dream.
Money isx Tha Motive !
Rose has an introverted personality. She listens to what the other person has to say and then internalizes her thoughts and emotions without communicating them aloud. By beind too afraid of telling her aunt how she truly feels and by just assuring Anna that their parents are doing their best for the family, this character seems to keep her true opinions to herself.
Rose is a woman of many different personalities and traits, but there is one trait in perticular that stands out.  Rose is a determined woman, she is willing to do anything and everything for the better of her family, and is willing to fit everything she can into her day.  an example from the story is, 'The day, like most of her days, had been too long, too demanding'.
Rose is responsible because when speaking to Aunt Kolab about all her work and worry she has due to help her family, she doesnt complain. Rose accepts that what she does must be done to help out her family and fulfills her duties.
I think one trait that can be concluded from this story about Rose is that she is a great listener, she takes advice and offers very well. One example is at the end of the story when Rose has a conversation with her Aunt Kolab she says she feels lighter after her aunt decided to offer to sew and make special treats for Rose and Anna.
rose laugh was gone sound fake, and paul finshing college.
In the last paragraph, it says that Rose kept nodding. This is meaning that Rose opens up to all options she has that her Aunt Kolab gives to her. Aunt Kolab is trying to help Rose, and Rose is very mature and understands this conflict as an adult.
Based on her conversation with Anna, Rose seems to be a caring person who watches out for others. When Anna says that she is lonesome for her father, Rose tries to lift her spirits and change Anna's attitude about the subject by saying that their father had to leave.
Rose is a very caring person.  In the conversation Rose was having with Anna, she was trying to reassure her sister. Rose was trying to let Anna know that everything would be alright once Paul recieved a job. Paul would pay for Rose and Anna to go to college so that they can get jobs.       When Rose is talking to Aunt Kolab she didn't want to tell her aunt about how she really felt about weighing down the family.  Rose believed that if she told the truth it would hurt Aunt Kolab's feelings.  Rose really did believe that she was being weighed down by her family, she just didn't want to admit it to Aunt Kolab.
One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna  is that she is sincere. Rose listens to Anna as she tells Rose she is sad for her two parents. Rose tries and cheers her up and looks on the positive side of things. That is why Rose is sincere.
In the converstation between Rose and Anna, a reader can depict that Rose is caring of others.  During the conversation Rose asks Anna if she's alright and Rose also tries to explain why their father is gone and that in the end it is all worth it.
Rose is caring, she says her and her sister have a part to do to help Paul finish college.
Rose is a very determined, hardworking girl. She does well in school, works a demanding job, and helps out around the house. Her conversation with Anna helps the reader to see her determination to succeed in life, and to make her sister feel better about the situation. Also, Rose's conversation with Aunt Kolab shows how Rose is determined not to let her family down.
Rose is guilty.   Rose did'nt answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.

One trait that can describe Rose is that she cares for the well being of others. She doesn't want to hurt others so she watchs what she says and is respectful. An example of this is when Rose is talkin with Aunt Kolab in the kitchen and her aunt asks her if she feels 'weighed down' by all she is doing. Rose being nice and not wanting to hurt her aunts feelings didn't give her an answer. Then her aunt realized that the family relies heavily on her and tries to make it easier on her.
Rose is very hard working, an example from the tex is when it talks about her daily schedule and balancing work, school, and her home life.

Stressed out, in her conversation with her aunt, Rose describes her dream and her aunt interprates it as Rose feeling too much weight to carry.
Based on Anna's response 'Only if you already have everything' when Rose says 'Money isn't everything' you can determine the Rose is very money driven has may have a slight trait of greed.
Rose can be described as being reserved about her true feelings. This shows in her conversation with Aunt Kolab, in which Rose's responses consist of nodding as Aunt Kolab is explaining how she understands Rose's point of view.
Rose is not a person that gives up, even when it gets rough.  Even though her family was going through a rough time and she couldn't find a topic for her paper, her aunt helped her find one.

She thinks about the getting the job done. When aunt Kolab was talking to her she was thinking that she could use that topic for her essay.
Humorous- She replied to Anna's comment, 'Money isn't everything', with 'Only if you already have everything.'
one trait that i would say anna has is worried. she always seems like she has no time. like when she is so busy, that she has not enough time to write the essay. If she does have enough time, however, she wont be able to get to sacramento. she is also worried, because she holds the fate of her brother in her hands. and worried for him, becasue he holds the fate of Anna and Rose in his hands.
Rose is really worried about what will happen in her future. The story said that she wants her dad to pay for her college, and her sister said money isn't everything.

The one trait would have to be honesty. She told Anna how she felt when they were talking. When they were talking about how their dad had to leave to make more money, Anna said 'money isn't everything', Rose said it isn't if you already have everything.
Rose is described as motherly and realistic in her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab.  Anna is clearly upset in her conversation with Rose, because her family lives a very hectic life and Anna needs someone.  Rose steps in and momentarily becomes a parental figure in this situation, attempting to comfort her sister in this difficult time.     She is also protrayed as very realistic.  This family is going through a lot and it is very understandable that Rose is stressed out over some of the things going on.  This is made clear during her conversation with Aunt Kolab, where she confesses about all the stress she is going through to her Aunt and talks everything out.
She feels stressed but she is still willing to work for her family's sake.Aunt Kolab asked her if she felt 'weighed down by what she was doing for the family' Rose didn't answer though because seh knew if she told the truth that it would hurt her aunt and family.

You can tell she is by having long days at school, and then having to work, followed up by helping her Aunt Kolab prepare supper, than having to do her homework and trying to concentrate on doing a 3000 word essay. She works very hard each day to accomplish this.
In this passage, Rose is the mother figure to Anna. Since their dad and mom both are gone working, Rose has to sweep in as the caretaker. Anna came to Rose because she had a bad dream. Anna talked about how she thought money wasn't everything and how she missed her parents. Even though Rose felt the same way and was struggling with the same problem, she had to grow up and be optimistic for her sister as if she was a parent.

Caring, because when her sister walked in the she asked her sister if something was wrong and if she was feeling okay.
She is a very busy person and doesnt have very much time for what she wants to do, and to be with her family. For example, this essay states how she barely has time for her writhing asignment 'When would she squeeze in a flawledd three-thousand-word essay?'
I think that Rose likes to keep her feelings to hereself like shes shy or just don't like to talk about her problems.
Throughout the story Rose has a motherly trait. She is looking after Anna while her mother is at work. Rose's characteristic is also brought out when she explains how she is working to help put her brother through college. The most improtant line that conveys this is when Anna says 'You sound just like Mama' (12).
Rose is not very expressive of how she truly feels. An example is when Anna askes her if she is feeling okay, Rose tells Anna she is okay when in reality she is stressed.
She never wants to let anyone down. Aunt Kolab asked her if she felt weighed down by helping the family. Rose didn't say yes because she knew that it would hurt Aunt Kolab and it would also hurt her mother.

caring
Rose is grateful because now, in the story, it says that she finally seeing things through others eyes instead of hers.
That Rose was kind and didn't want to hurt anyone. In the passage Rase said to her self that ' If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.'
She is sincere, she tries to comfort her sister when she talks about missing her father. Rose tells Anna that her father went to work because he already had everything else he needed except money.
Rose seemed like a very helpful person when she was talking to her sister Anna. She seemed this way becuase when her sister came to her to talk about things she tried to explain to her why things were the way they were.
A trait that i see in Rose is that she is very caring. She is concerned for Anna when she walks up in tears and she asks her whats wrong. The whole time in there conversationg she tries to calm her down like when she tried to laugh to relax the tension between them.
Rose is tired. She has a lot on her plate for someone of her age, from work to school to homework, and helping her brother through college. She is having trouble taking care of all of it, and just wants someone to help her get some of the weight off of her back.
Based on her conversation with Anna, Rose can be seen as mature. When Rose is talking to Anna, she tells her that what her family is doing is necessary. Anna doesn't understand why their father has to be away in Los Angeles. She also doesn't understand why money is so important to her parents. This is where Rose shows her maturity. She explains to her sister the importance of their father's job and why they need the money so badly.
Rose says that they have their part to do while Paul is away at college. This shows that Rose is independent and smart.
In Rose's conversation with Aun Kolab, Rose reveals her concern for other peoples' feelings.  Her care of others' feelings show up previously in her conversation with Anna. Anna walks in feeling down, but instead of venting her own feelings, Rose keeps them to her self and listens to her sister.
'Honest' because Rose tells Anna That helping Paul would help them finish college then he'll get a good job and he'll pay for Anna and Rose to go to college.

She doesnt want to make her family feel bad and have to struggle for anybody who was left or is not there.
Rose is very family orinated. She cares aabout what happens to her family, even if she doesn't like it. She showed this when she talked about her work and her paper. She wanted to help by working but she didn't like that she had no ltime for herself.
One trait that can describe Rose is that she is caring for others. One detail to support this answer is how Rose decides not to tell Aunt Kolab the truth about feeling weighed down because of the possiblity of hurting her.
It says in the text that her aunt's offer had somehow made her feel lighter like that the pressure had been lifted.
She is not very caring. Like for example, on paragraph eight sentence two she said like she was careless, 'Mama's not home yet, is she.' She was being sarcastic with her sister.
Rose is a very helpful person and does stuff that will help other people. She is working so her brother Paul can go to college.
Many of Rose's traits are displayed throughout the story. One trait that is shown is how she is caring. In the text Rose is worried about hurting her mother or her aunt. Rose feels as if she is being overwhelmed with everything she has to do. This in turn causes her to have a dream of being trapped in the water by her older brother. As she attempts to get out, water fills her mouth and she sinks further down. She decides to tell her aunt of this dream. Her aunt then begins to question her about if she feels weighted down. Rose ignores the question because she doesn't want to hurt her family.
I think that accepting life is one because she tries to explain to her sister the way that life is going at the moment for them.
Rose, at first, only cared about the future of success in relation to money, but actually she does not feel that she should complete the tasks to make it happen. She doesn't want so much responsibility weighing down on her.
A trait that describes Rose would be responsible. An example of how Rose is a responsible young lady is because during her conversation with her aunt she doesnt respond when her aunt asks her 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family.' She does not answer because she knows that she has to help out in order for her family to be able to survive.
Considerate. In paragraph 19, the author writes, 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.'
One trait that stands out to me mostly in Rose is fear of what she must do for her brother and how so much responsibility is laid on such a young girl. According to the passage, Rose thinks to herself, 'Paul's fate lies partly in these', referring to her hands. That statement represents that she is thinking about what she has been doing for her brother to go to college and how her brother's getting into college shouldn't rely on her.
She is really trying to help the family.
One word that can describe Rose is 'Busy'. She is always on the run after school she has to put in four hours at the restruant, and than right as she gets out of school she has to go home, watch her sister and do her home work. On  top of all of that she has to do a three-thousnad word essay that is for a state competition. If she won that competition she  would not be able to go to Sacramento. Her dad is also in Los Angeles andher brother Paul is at college.
She is very frustatid, because she has not got her essay complet
Rose is from Cambodialine 20 'in Cambodia, our first country, what we are all doing would be quite normal,'
Rose is resentful because she feels like what she is doing to help her family isn't enough and she doesn't like to stay up and write the essay plus everything else she has to deal with.
One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversation with her aunt would be that she is frustrated with the situations in her family life.One detail from the story that supports my answer is that Roses aunt asked hert if it was difficult for her, and she nodded.
The one trait that can describe Rose is intelligent. One example of this is that she is going to enter an essay contest.
Rose is concerned and is filled with self conflict. Didn't know wether or not to tell her aunt.
One trait of Rose's is reassurance.  She tries to reassure her sister that everything will be better when she says, 'Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'  This statement clearly proves the point of her being a good big sister and trying to make her sister feel better.
Rose is hopeful. While talking to her aunt, Rose is hopeful that her life will get easier after hearing her aunts suggestions.
One trait that describes Rose is that she's really caring torward her family. Paragraph 13, the way she describes her brother's high school graduation.
Rose is a very positive person and is the oldest of her sister Anna. While the two of them were having a conversation, Rose is trying to explain to Anna many different things since Rose is the only one who is often around the house. When Anna talks about how she misses her father, Rose explains to her that he had to go to make a living, and that he would be back soon.
Rose is a good person and wants to do everything she can for the family. When she talks to Aunt Kolab, and when her Aunt offers to sell some baked goods, Rose feels a burden lifted off her shoulders. One exmple from the story, is that when her Aunt asks 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose doesn't answer, because she didn't want to hurt her aunt, and she just wanted to continue to help the family.
By the time Rose tiptoed into their room, Anna was already snoring lightly. Rose slid into bed and watched the lights from passing cars move across the walls. They became the light that had illuminated the stage att Paul's high school graduation.
From this story I think the best trait to describe Rose is that she's unselfish.  You can see why Rose is unselfish when she talks about how even if she won the essay competition she couldn't go get her prize from Sacramento because she wouldn't be able to take off of her work which helps support her family.  This part of the passage helps you see that Rose puts her family before herself.
Rose seems to be a strong person that can take care of her family. Even though she isn't the mother, she is taking care of her and other's responsibilities. When Rose fake laughed to help comfort her sister, it showed that she actually cares and she is a mother-like figure to Anna.
I think that one trait of Rose that i picked up from her conversations is that she is very hard working. She shook her head yes to her aunts question of the situation being difficult for her. She knows it is difficult and she knows that the outcome of her work will be better for her and her sister, but yet she still works reallyhard to get her brother to college. That shows me that she is definitaly a hard worker because she is doing it so she can go on and work even harder to get to where she wants to be in life.
Rose is compassionate. Rose asks how Anna feels, she would not ask this unless she cares about her. The reason she cares about her is that Anna is Rose's sister
Rose is sympathetic when having a conversation with her sister Anna. While Anna talks about hating how late their mother works and how their father is in Los Angeles, Rose tries to explain that their parents are only doing it to help the family. She tells her sister that they are working hard to support their kids so they can graduate high school and go on to college.
She feels weighed down. 'Rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream, to expose it so it would loosen its grip on her.'
Rose likes to have people feel welcome and feel like they are at home. Rose is always so kind and generous to her guests.
That she has to much thigns to do and its all in her hands. Her mother works very long nights nad her dad work all over the world.
Rose is respectful because she puts what her family needs done before what she needs done.
She is very caring the way she helps her family and trys to help her brother.
She is caring. You can tell this because she's worried about her sister. She asks her if she's alright and she is trying to explain to her in a nice way that their dad had to go, but that it would be okay.
According to Rose's and Anna's conversation Rose seemed eager for her family to get out of the situation they are in. And the conversation she had with her aunt best describes Rose as eager and willing to help her family out in anyway she can.
Rose is very understanding even when she is having a rough time.  Rose tells her sister that their dad had to go because it was a decision good for the family.  She tries to stay positive for her sister.
Hopeful. 'Rose kept nodding. Maybe her life would get easier. Maybe it wouldn't. But her aunt's offer had somehow made her feel lighter.'
She is caring. She asks her sister whats wrong when she walks in rubbing her eyes.
Rose and her Aunt Kolab can trust each other and not argue about it. That Rose's topic was suddenly lighter after the talk with her Aunt Kolab.
One trait that describe Rose is that she is a hard worker. By going to school, working a four hour shift, and writing a three thousand word essay proves that Rose works hard so her family can live a better life.
confused, she doesn't seem to quite understand what her sister is telling her and lead to where she is misguided.
I think it is the ablilty to care for others,because Rose has to give herself to help Paul.
After having the conversatino with her Aunt Kolab, Rose finally realized that her life could be getting easier.
Rose is caring. We know this because in paragraph 4-6, Rose is very concerned about the well-being of her younger sister. She asks her what's wrong and if she is feeling okay.
One trait of rose would be that she does not hae enought time to do everything in the house, she is even having her sister do her essay for her.
One trait that can describe Rose is that she is a quiet person she does not express her feelings very much, for example when her Aunt asked her 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose did not answer, and she felt as if she would have answered she would hurt her aunt, and her aunt would probably tell her mother.
Rose is very cluttered and busy.  in the story, it said that she was trying to squeeze her essay into her busy day.
Rose can handle pressure quite well. Although she was under enormous self-enflicted pressure she still manged to emerge with an essay topic.
Rose, although feeling pressured, doesn't want to make things harder on anyone or to hurt anyone. She is considerate to others feelings. This trait is revealed in the conversation Anna had with her Aunt Kolab when her aunt asks Rose if she feels weighed down by all that she is doing for the family and Rose doesn't say anything for fear that it would hurt her aunt.
A trait that well describes Rose is that she puts other peoples feelings above her own, and she cares more of how others feel than herself. An example is in paragraph 19 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.'
Based on Rose's conversations, it is very obvious that she is a caring person. She would rather suffer herself than make anyone else hurt. Rose's aunt asks her if she felt weighed down. Rose couldn't answer in fear of hurting her aunt or her mother.
She does not talk much. She usually nods and gives jestures. If she does speak, she used short and choppy sentences.
She very worried for the family and that is why she says 'What's wrong? You feel okay?'
When Rose is talking to her sister, Anna she tries to look at the bright side of things. She tries to get her sister to think positive about the situations in their family. Rose tries to get her to see that everything the others in her family are doing is going to help them out in the long run. Rose says 'It's only been four months, He had to go. The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here.' When Anna starts to get negative Rose tells her that they have to support their brother, Paul, and he will support them in the future. Rose has a positive attitude.
One trait that identifies Rose is that she is a very caring person. She wants to have her dad back from his job so they can have a family and live happily again.
she is having a hard time with everything becouse of the essey and the family.
Rose's conversations with her Aunt Kolab shows that she is a caring person.  When her aunt asks her if she feels weighed down because of her responsibilities, Rose is hesitant to answer because she does not want to upset her aunt.
Rose is very determined. She wants to do the best that she can for her family and also for herself. She is trying to help the family while her mom is gone working and she is also doing her best in school so that she can get her diploma.
She seems to be very hardworking like when she felt that it was urgent to relate to the dream and it needed to be done.
She has a wondering mind. She has dreams about everything.
Rose is very honest about her situation. She wants to be less pressured. Her aunt can see this from their conversation.
From her conversations with Anna, I conclude that Rose is like a mother figure to Anna sometimes. She tries to stay positive so her little sister doesn't get discouraged. In the story, it states that Anna says, 'You sound just like Mama.' This shows that Rose has the traits of a mother figure in their relationship. Since Rose is the older sister, she has to look over her little sister when her mother is gone.
Caring. If she told her aunt the truth she would hurt her aunt.
Rose is caring based on her conversation with Anna because of her walking in and asking if she is okay and poured two glasses of orange juice and talked.
Rose is hard working and feels like she has to work hard for her family. By the dream you can conclude that she feels weighed down by the hard work she has to put into supporting her family. She however continues to work on her essay and comes up with a topic to write about.
Rose internalizes all her pressure and misgivings. She hides her true feelings when she talks to Anna. 'She tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her.' Even Rose doesn't believe what she says, she only puts on a brave face while talking to Anna.
One of her traits is her maturity. Even thou she is just a child she thinks as an adult. She explains to Anna that they have a part in this family to help Paul finish college. Most kids would complain about the work but instead she works with no complaint.
She is a compasionate and caring person that cares about others. One detail from the story that supports my answer is when she asked her sister what was wrong and if she felt okay.
One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab would be hard-working. She works hard in school, goes to work, and then helps around the house every day. Even her aunt understood how she might be 'weighed down' by the things she does.
Rose is pressured     She'd already had to miss a lot of shifts, and her supervisor was on the verge of firing her.
In the conversation with Anna, Rose seemed to have been worried about her essay. However, when Anna walked in and started to talk about their mother Rose suddenly got angry but gentle with Anna. Rose is a busy person with too much on her plate.
One trait about rose is that she is very helpful. When Aunt Kolab asks her if she feels weighed down by what all that rose does to help the family, but she can't say the truth because she is afraid that Aunt Kolab will tell mother.
One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna is that she is just like her mom. One detail that supports my answer is in paragraph 12. Anna rolled her eyes and shoved her chair away from the table and said, 'You sound just like Mama.'
'Only if you already have everything,' Rose said. Rose seems exhausted, as if shes mad that she had to grow up so soon. She doesnt like the fact that she has to have so much responsibility. Her Papa not being there is what makes it worse for her. Even thought she thought it was better off for him to be in Los Angeles.
Rose seems like a very shy person. In her conversation with Aunt Kolab, the only time she actually speaks is to relay her dream. Then, when Aunt Kolab gives her some advice, she just nods several times and never vocalizes the fact that she was going to use the topic for her essay, or that she was very helped out by Aunt Kolabs's advice.
She is very dreamy.
Rose doesn't like the fact that her brother has taken responsibility for both Rose and her sister.  For example, when she said, 'only three years older, he held the fate of two people--both his sisters--in his hands.
Rose is very hard working and sometimes even though its hard she will keep trying no matter what. She often looks to the bright side of things. One detail from the story is when her and her sister Anna were talking, Anna felt resentment towards her parents because they left them, but Rose doesnt complain about it and keeps living her life without complaining.
Rose is a trusting person. In her conversation with Anna she says, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.' She puts her trust in her brother that he will graduate from college and get a good job to pay for her and their sister to go to college also. Rose could not put her trust in her brother and save her money, from working, for herself, but instead she puts her trust in her brother and works because she believes he will get a good job.
Imaginative because she thought of that dream.
One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversation with Anna is that of wisdom. Rose is able to understand that money is very important to her family, saying to anna 'Only if you already have everything.' when the girl tells her that money isn't everything.
Rose cares about others. An example is 'Its only been four months,' Rose said as gently as she could.  'He had to go.  Yhe job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here.'
Rose fell asleep trying to work on her essay. When Anna walked in Rose asked if she was ok and Anna said no. Rose told her that she fell asleep. This goes to show that she is always busy and has little time to do anything else.
Roses ocversation with Anna shows that she is mature. When Anna gets upset about missing her Papa, instead of getting angry with Anna for not being understanding, Rose calmly explains to her that it is necessary for him to work in Los Angeles because he is making  more money there.
She is caring for her sister because she was trying to make her feel better about their father being away. She said it had only been four months, and said he will eventually get a better job to put us through college.
There are many different traits I could use to describe Rose, I feel that brave would describe her the best. I think this because when Rose's Aunt Kolab asked is Rose felt weighed down by her family,Rose didn't want to answer. Rose didn't want to answer because she was prepared to take care of the family. Im my mind that is really brave.
One trait of Rose is she is very busy. You can tell this because she barely has time to right an essay because of her job.
Rose can see from her aunts point of view like she says in the story, she thought about wheather or not what she said about the dream if it would hurt her aunts feelings or not.  Also she is respectfull of others and their pesonal opinions.
Rose is very caring towards her family. In the story, she doesn't want to tell her aunt that she is weighed down by all she is doing for Paul because she fells that this might discourage her mother and aunt.
Rose seems to be a busy-body who has no time to enjoy life, case in point : 'when would she squeeze in writing a flawless three-thousand-word essay?'
Uncertain
One trait the describes Rose is hard working. Even though her aunt, her sister, and her are working to pay for Paul to go to college and get his diploma she never stops working. She is always willing to see what is best for the other person in the relationship. She could just law down and say 'I quit,' but she doesn't. She keeps working towards a better future for her family and herself.
Rose seems to have the trait of being stressed. In paragraph 18, her Aunt Kolab asked Rose if she feels too weighed down with everything she is doing for this family. Part of that conversation reflets the effort Rose is putting into everything and how stressed she truely is.
She seems to be worried about many different things.
When Rose talks about her father and his job in Los Angeles; He's paid more their than at home. She want's to get into college and she thinks money will do the trick. They both believe money will support their lives.
Rose is selfish. When talking to her sister Rose responds to Anna's comment 'Money isn't everything' by saying 'Only if you have everything'. This shows that Rose cares more about money than then her family making her selfish.
Although Rose feels very weighed down and stressed by the weight of the family, she is very considerate of other people's feelings. She does not want to hurt her aunt or her mother's feelings by admitting the way that she feels. However, Aunt Kolab is very understanding and talks through the situation with her niece.
Honest. Rose is honest when she tells Aunt Kolab about her dream. When Kolab asked if she felt weighed down, Rose didn't answer-- she was being honest with herself.
Rose thinks that money is very important and determines your overall state of wealth and her sister doesn't. In the story as Rose and Anna were talking Anna says 'Money isn't everything Rose' and then Rose replies 'Not if you already have everything.' And to me this is just like saying that Rose wouldn't be happy unless she had everything.
She said that she feels like she is the one who is supporting the family and that she feels weighed down because of it. When Rose is talking to Anna, she states how she feels about her father leaving, and that upsets Anna.
worry is the trait that I think Rose based her conversation with her aunt Kolab on. Her aunt says 'Maybe we can find a way to do things differently. A way better for you.'
'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job,Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.' This is a quote taken out of the passage. Rose is trying to calm Anna down she understands that  its hard for her and it is almost as if Rose has become the 'mother figure' in Annas life. So the trait that identified in the passage is that she caring. She cares so much for the other people in her life that she is willing to suffer.
She hides how she feels alot while she talks,'I hate how late she has to work,' her voice sank into a deep whisper
Rose is very responsible and wants to help out her family. one detail from the story that supports this is when Aunt Kolb asked Rose if she felt weighed down by what she was doing t help the family.
Rose is very supportive, even though she hides her true feelings. She exhibits this when she is talking to Anna, laughing at her own statement, even though the narrators says even Rose herself could tell it was fake.
Flexibility because she had to change in many ways from moving to a whole new country and it had really discouraged her. Rose starts to see that there are ways that the situation gets better when at the end of the conversation in paragraph 23 when she sees that maybe her life could get better and she finally thought of a topic for her essay. flexibilt
stressed.she cupped her hands.
Rose is a girl that likes to nod alot. A detail about her is that she is a very strong girl.
melanie Adair
She is perservering, as can be seen in paragraph 23. She heeds her aunt's advice and proceeds to write her essay. This shows an aspect of determination in Rose.
One trait that Rose has shown is hopefulness.  Even though things are hard for her right now she isn't giving up on things.  In paragraph 23 of the text it states, 'But her aunt's offer had somehow made her feel lighter.'  By listening to what her aunt had to say and stepping back to see the whole situation, Rose gained the hope that she wouldn't be stressed for long.
She is a hardworker. 'From school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After that it was time to do homework.'
She is hopeful. In her conversation with Anna she says, 'We have do to our part to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'. She is hoping and trusting that Paul will do well in college.
One detail I can identify from this story is that their family most likely came from a different country. 'Her aunt's face lit up. 'Maybe I can sew for ladies. Or I could make special treats from our country and sell them.''
She feels that she needs to help with every thing. She works a lot and can't do the essay like she wants. Even if she won she can't travel to Sacramento to recive the prize.
Rose is reminding person because she reminds her sister about how they have to help their brother. An example of this then Rosa says 'we have our part to do to help Paul finish college
She is positive. Instead of complaining about what's wrong she keeps it to herself and talks about what's right.
One trait of Rose is that she is obediant. She retains her feelings while talking with her Aunt Kolab in the kitchen, even though she really dislikes the fact that she has to work to put her older brother through college. Rose doesn't tell her Aunt her real feelings so that it does not bother her Aunt, and so that her Aunt would not tell her mother who would be very uneased about the sitituation.
Rose is very hardworking. She goes to school, work, and helps out at home so that her family may have a better life. Her Aunt Kolab understands this, and asks Rose if all the work she is doing is too much for her.
Rose in very responceable because in the story she si stell Aunt Kolab that she is exausted from workin and aunt Kolab asks if it is putting too much stress on  her trying to help out this family.
Rose is a hrdworking girl who tries to good in everything she does.In the passage of crossing over in paragraph two ' From school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After it was time to do homework' this shows how hard working and dedicated Rose is to her family.
Rose is a caring person because in paragraph 19 it says that Rose didin't answer so she would not hurt her aunt's feelings.
Rose is a very respectful person. While she was talking with her aunt she did not want to tell her how she truly felt because she believed it would upset her, and the rest of the family. Rose likes to put other people before herself. She is a caring person but she sometimes doesn't understand when it is to much. After talking with her aunt she realized that she couldnt weigh herself down with other peoples problems. 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' That quote is from the story, and that quote is what made me infer what type of person Rose was. She does her best to help people, especially the ones she loves, and in the end she is just weighing herself down. That is the heart of a true caring person, and not only a caring person, but a strong person as well.
One thing that describes Rose is that she is over worked and tired.  One detail is that most of her days had been too long, too demanding.  From school she had gone stright to the restaurant to work a four-hour shift, than stright home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper.
A trait that is able to describe Rose would be her determination. Though she is weighted down by her family struggles, Rose still writes the essay for the contest. And though she felt hopeless, after speaking with her Aunt Kolab, Rose felt a renewed sense of hope and determination that she can continue.
Rose is a person that tries to keep everyone happy by telling them what they want to hear, and not exactly what she feels.  She says that ''He had to go.''  She also refers to a laugh that came no where near soundind sincere.
I think that Rose is a giving person because she says' maybe I can sew for ladies. Or could make special treats from our country and sell them.'
Rose is considerate of other peoples feelings.'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.
I think Anna comes off to be this really exciting girl who wants a life but she is too busy taking care of her family that she has no time to stop and think about who she really wants to be.      'From school she'd gone straight to the resturant to work four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper, then she would do homework.'
Rose tries to look at the bright side by telling Anna that everything will be fine but she is actually very worried.
In Rose's conversation with Aunt Kolab, her Aunt asks 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' She remains quiet. I feel that this reaction sums up how she is feeling, she is stressed yet she doesn't want to hurt her family. She wants to help, because she loves her family, though she is struggling.
Ignorant, because she didn't give up on all here work to do. She kept on goin and found a solution.
Her life can get easier maybe it wouldnt .so it might ot might not.
One trait that can be described is pride instead of rose swallowing her pride and telling Anna what she really felt she coverd up her felling  and told he sister something else in witch to get here sister to leave her alone or change the sbject.
One trait that can descibe Rose is her loyalty to her family.  She will do anything to help her family succeed.  This is shown when it is revealed that Rose works at the restaurant to help her brother pay for college.
One trait that describes Rose would be caring/worried.  One detail from the story would be when Rose asks what's wrong with Anna.
She respects what her family wants. The whole time her sister was arguing on how much she misses her dad and mom, Rose knew what was right and what she had to do.
Rose truly puts her family first. She is taking a job that conflicts with her school work jsut to help put paul through college. Rose is only a highschool girl and she is already taking on a huge amount of resposibility for her family.
Rose seems to go along with what other people have to say.  She doesn't seem like one to get angry with people very easily.  When Anna got disrespectful with the way she was talking to Rose, Rose never once got angry or back-talked Anna.
The fate of rose lies in Pauls hands, her aunts trying to help her by making her feel lighter, and made her think of a topic.
I believe that Rose is careing. In the conversation she had with her Aunt Kolab, about the dream, rose did not want to explain to her aunt the way she felt, because she felt that she would hurt her aunt by telling her the way she felt. I think that when someone puts someone elses feelings, or thoughts before their own is a careing person.
Anna is a VERY smart girl and the reason I think that is because she was gone do a three-thousand word essay.
Rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream, to expose it so it would loosen its grip on her.
Rose misses her dad terribly but knows he's just doing this job in Los Angeles to help pay for her brother's education. Anna misses him too and she says she doesn't care about the money. She just wants her father back.
Frustrated
She feels its her responsibility to help support Paul and the family, so that later in return he can finance both Rose and Annas college educations.
Rose is caring and wants to help people. When she is having a conversation with her aunt, she tries to avoid telling her that all the work she does for this family is really hard. She does this because she does not want to hurt her feelings.
She is caring. She talks to her sister, lessons to her and tells her that money isn't everything.
In the story your perspective is from Rose.  Rose, like other humans, has many traits to her personality.  One trait that you can see is giving.  An example of this is how she works to help her brother get through college.  She seems to be constantly busy, but doesn't outrightly complain about it.  This is an example of a trait I find Rose has.
To me, Rose seems like a competitive girl. She doesn't want to loose. Meaning by that, the fact stating, she has to write a three thousand word essay. Rose says, 'Even if I win, I won't get to travel to sacremento to recieve the prize.' This means she wants to win. She won't give up on her dreams.
I think Rose is decribed as a hard worker an is exhausted. In the passage it replies, 'The day, like most of her days, had been too long, too demanding. From school she'd gone straight to the restraunt to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After that it was time to do homework.' This example supports my answer why i think Rose is decribed as a hardworker an is exhausted.
Strong, in paragragh tweenty three she realized that her family could survive an ocean crossing.
'Anna,'Rose said 'What's wrong? You feel okay?' from this part of the story i felt that she was caring.
When Rose says that he has only been gone for four months and he is getting paid three times as much in Los Angeles. It shows that Rose a mature and understanding person, partly because she feels obligated to.
From her conversation with Anna, Rose shows that she is willing to do her part to make money even though it's a burden because she knows that, in the end, it will be beneficial for her and her sister.
She worries a lot about if she will beable to go to college or if she would be able to do anything. This is shown when Rose starts to talk about how her brother must have felt during the time he was there and that now that he is in college he might have to help pay to get his family higher in the world. Also with all the rsponsibility he had when he was there is now passed on to Rosa which is causing her to not have any time to do anything.
One trait that Rose has in the story is that she works hard for the success of others, and does not think about the affects on her. When Rose is tired from working and helping her aunt, she must then do her homework. She does not have much time to do so, and is often too tired to even finish. This proves that she believes she can help make a difference for Paul, and that he will return the favor. Even though Rose is extremely busy helping her family put her brother through college, she surpresses her real feelings to her family because she must do her part. In the story Rose supports this claim by thinking. 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.' This is showing that she does not want to work and instead focus on school, but she knows what she must do, and is afraid of hurting her family. In the story, Rose is a hard worker, and respects other's feelings.
One trait that Rose is dealing with is poverty. Rose feels she does not do enough to help. Rose's father moved else-where to get more money for the family. Paul is going to college trying to make it through. Poverty is sad to say is what trait Rose was stricten with.
One trait that Rose used was when they were agrueing, she was talking about how her family is poor and they dont have much money and her sister Anna said 'You sound just like mom.' Rose is like her mom in that way.
rose aunt and her are  family and they love each other and they are nice  but it seems anna is jleus.
Standing up and and helping there brother paul get off to a good collage.
they do think a like she think different but they both miss papa
One trait that can describe Rose from her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab is caring. Rose is caring as shown through the part of the story where she is cautious to tell her Aunt Kolab that she feels weighed down by the support she offers the family.  Rose takes time to ponder if she should tell her Aunt Kolab because she fears she will hurt her, and her mother.  Rose does not want to hurt her family, therefore she is caring.
Based on the conversations between Rose and Anna, Rose seems to be a person who is trying to be positive and strong for her family.  When Anna brings up their missed father, she blames him for leaving the family.  Rose tries to explain to her that he only left the family because they needed the money.
One trait that can describe Rose is determination. One detail that supports Rose being determined is how even though she feels busy and overloaded, she is determined to still work hard at her job and school work to make things easier for her family.
Rose tries to keep people happy. You can see this because rose does not want tell her family how she really feels.
Rose kept nodding when she was talking with her aunt Kolad or she pretend everything was going to fine.
Rose is a stressed out individual. She has many conflicts going on with her family along with school stressors. at one point she says that she must be insane to think she could handle all of her family issues along with her schooling.
Anna is a very strong young woman. She may not always like that her dad has to work in another town, or that her mother is always woking late into the morning, but she does it because she truly cares about her family.
Rose is a Cambodian girl and it tells you this in the story when it says Cambodia was here first country.
One trait Rose has show is her responsibility toward the family. She have been trying to work four hours after school everday to try to bring home some money to help support the family.
Rose doesn't depend on herself. She always looks down on the situation.
ROSE FELT AN URGENT NEED TO RELATE THE DREAM, TO EXPOSE IT SO IT WOULD LOOSEN IT'S GRIP ON HER. sHE HAS A TRAIT THAT SHE HAS TO GET ALL OF HER EMOTIONS OUT TO MAKE HER FEEL AT EASE.
Rose feels like she's responsible for helping take care of her family and dosen't have time to do anything due to the weight shes carrys for her family by helping out.
Rose dreamed that she swam through clear, green-tinted water, enjoying the pure simplicity of a fish's life: which means she loves doing cirtin things and other things not so much.Rose felt like she was too young for so much responceability.
Roes is caring. She worries about her whole family and wants to help make life better for them. during her talk with Anna Roes says 'we have to do our part to help Paul finish college.' showing that she wants what is best for her brother.
Based on her conversations with Anna, one trait that describes Rose would be that she knows that they've got to do what they've got to do to get by. For example, how Anna said she misses her father and that it seems like he's been gone for years but Rose said, 'He had to go. The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here.'
One trait that describes Rose based on her conversations would be Stubborn, I think that Rose is very stubborn and somewhat ungrateful. she is stubborn because she complains about everything, she doesnt take anything for granted and never wants to give up on what she wants. In a way its a good thing that Rose is stubborn because people cant take advantage of her and she wont stop trying something until she wins. But on the other hand she can hurt people and can be annoying. this is the trait I chose that best fits Rose.
Rose is very weighed down by all of the stresses in her life. Her Aunt Kolab infers her struggling and offers to help Rose in their conversation at the end of the story.
Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.
In the story rose felt lonely she said. maybe if her dad came home for a weekend or her mom took a day off to be with the girls and help them out with school work maybe she wouldnt feel that way.
Rose has many traits. T he one that stuck out to me the most is how hard wroking she is.
Anna dont really tell how she realy feels. In her conversation with Aunt Kalob she dont tell her how she really feels about helping the family.
'Anna,' Rose said. 'What's wrong? You feel okay?' One trait of Rose is that she is caring.
One of Rose's character traits is that she is hopeful for a brighter future regardless of the present problems in her life. As can be seen in her conversation with Anna, she recogizes her current stresses will help them get into good colleges in the long-run.
She gets worked up easy. She thinks about the essay that she has to wright and that even if she wins she cant go get her prize. Then she thinks about her brother and everything that her parents did for him and about money and why her dad moved so far away.
One trait is exhausted, she feels this way because she feels it is all up to her.  Her conversation with Aunt Rose verifies this.
One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversation with Anna is that she is lonely.  In the passage, she talks about how she misses her father and wishes that her mother was around more.  She shows that she really wants them in her life and is heartbroken that they are not.
rose dreamed that she swam
Anna is a helper. She helps a lot around the house even though she does not like to do it.
Rose is a very busy girl, often tied down with taking care of her sister Anna, and wanting her mother home. But she finds herself in a self centered position and would complain about how terrible her life is. At the end of this story, She realized that she can survive this family splitting all by herself when she said, 'Suddenly it occurred to her: here was the topic for her essay, although it was still vague. Cambodian tradition and sense of family, she realized, could survive an ocean crossing.'
Rose seems very overwhelmed. In paragraph thirteen, Rose is even troubled in her sleep about her overwhelming problems during the day. This suggest that her life has become busy to the point of an overwhelming capacity.
In this story, Rose bears a lot of responsibility. Everyone in the family must work in order to pay for Paul's education which will help the family as a whole. Rose feels too much pressure and she tries unsuccessfully to convince herself that she is alright with everything. She is conflicted to say the least.
Rose is a very caring person. She gave up basically her whole life just to take care of her family. One example of caring for her family that she portrays in the story is when she is writting her essay for the state competition and she gives it up because she knows that if she wins she wouldnt be able to go to Sacramento anyways. She would have to stay home and take care of her family.
She is stuburn and wants things her way because she just rolled her eyes and stormed out of the room.
In conversing with her sister, Rose continually reassures her of the brightness of the future, attempting to laugh and sound optimistic. She herself takes on the task of writing the essay, an unnecessary burden on top of her numerous tasks, suggesting that she is trying to repress a feeling of doubt that she shares with her sister. Thus a prominent characteristic of Rose is her unwillingness to accept the desparation of her family's condition, taking burdens upon her to help convince herself that things are going normally.
One trait that descibes Rose based on the conversation between her and Anna is that she is helpful in many ways. To me it seems that Rose is more of the mother figure in Anna's life and is there for her when she needs something. She helps tries to help out with the money situation by working. An example of the book of how Rose shows this trait is when Anna woke up and came into where Rose was, Rose asked if she was alright and if she felt okay.
In the story Rose is hesatent to tell her feelings because she doesnt want to hurt anyone. She says'if she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt'. I think that Rose is shy and that she wants to make things work for her family but she doesnt want to have to hurt anyone in trying to do so.
Rose is a hard worker and worries a lot. Rose is very persistent. One example is in paragraph two. Im paragraph it talks about how much homework she has to do. Then how she has to work to help support her entire family.
Rose is helpful.  She works to help support Paul and the rest of her family.  Anna and Aunt Kolab both talk about the problems that are occuring because of all the things that they have to do to support the family.
Rose seems a bit overloaded according to her conversation with Aunt Kolab
One trait I found in this story about Rose, would be that she is caring. Her Aunt Kolab asked, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose is to caring about her Aunt's feelings to tell her the truth and crush her feelings.
Rose is a hardworker. In the beginning of the story, she explains going to school, heading straight to work for a four-hour shift, and then straight home to help make dinner. After all of that, she still has to do homework.
She cares for her family. When she talks to Anna she said 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
Rose can be decribed as patient during her conversation with Anna.  When she tries to to explain to Anna why everyone is trying to work so hard to help Paul finish college, she calmly speaks to Anna, even though she knows Anna may not fully understand.  Even though Anna clearly did not understand what Rose was saying, she does not lose her temper or show any negative reaction towards Anna's retort at the end of the conversation.  Instead, she remains tolerant, which takes a great deal of patience on her part.
Rose is a person who puts others before herself and wants to be helpful. 'Rose didn't answer. If she to;d the truth she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mom' this describes her puting her familly before herself.
Rose tries to reassure her sister about their father working in a different place. When Anna says 'It feels like he's been gone for years,' Rose kindly breaks in that he has only been gone for four months, and that they needed the money.
I think a trait that Rose has is caring. Rose is caring because she cares about her family and understands what things are going on and tries to help her sister understand. She also is like a leader to her sister.
She seems somewhat self centered for example when her sister walks in the room she asks, 'whats wrong? You feel okay?', and when the sister replies that she had a bad dream she doesnt ask why or what happend.
She understands the importance of finacial need. When she stated that her dad moved away to another job that paid three times what he was making before, reveals that she has some intelligance in money.
Rose's conversation with Aunt Kolab suggests that Rose is very mature and responsible for her age. Rose's aunt can see how much stress she is under. Rose doesn't say anything though, knowing the family needs money to survive. When Aunt Kolab says something to Rose about being 'weighed down by helping the family,' Rose admits she's under much stress.
There mad that their mom has to work so late.''Mamas not home yet is he', 'I hate how late she has to work'
One trait that describes Rose would have to be that she hard working. She works for what her family needs so that there lives can become better.
She cares about her sister Anna. This is supported by Rose asking Anna 'whats wrong'? and 'are you feeling ok'?
When Rose's sister walked and asked what's worng? Rose tried to tell than she was fine that just she had another bad dream. Rose's sister said the money isn't everything, then Rose tell to her sister than they have to help Paul, so Anna dislike for that. 'You sond just like Mama'. Anna wants to mean that Rose start to think and talk like her mother.
One trait that can descibe Rose is exhausted.she is exhausted because of everything that she must do for herself and the family. She must work at a restaurant after school and then go strait home to make supper and she still has homework to do. Rosa is a very buisy person and does not have enough time for herself or her homework.
One trait that can describe Rose based on her converstation with Aunt Kolab is that she is caring. That she cares what other people feel and how what she says may hurt the other person. The statement that supports my answer would be 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mom.' That indicated that she cared what she could have said would hurt her aunt and that her aunt could very well tell her mom. She was probably scared it would hurt her mother too.
Rosa feels that she weiged down by her family, and theres is not much she can do about it.  The floashback that involved her brother  standing on top of her in the water, sybolizes herfeeling weiged down and no able to get much help.
The conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab was a good sisters relationship.
One trait that describes Rose based on her conversations with Anna is pessimistic. She doesn't believe that their life will get better as fast as Anna would like it to. You can see that by Anna saying that money isn't everything and her enthusiasm as she talks about how Paul will graduate college and help pay for their college fees. Rose acts accordingly and compares Anna to her mother, which shows that Anna and her mother are the optimistic characters of the story.
1. she doesn't like to see people disappointed or u- happy. for example 'if she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.'
Rose is a self-absorbed American teenager.  She feels sorry for herself and believes she has a great burdon on her shoulders.  She does not realize that all of her family has had to work hard.  Her Aunt realize that she is like this because of where she was raised.  Since Rose feels she has to much burden, Aunt Kolab says, 'In Cambodia, our first country, what we're all doing would be quite normal'.
I think that Rose seems lonely and that is why she has so much in her life. She works to help out the family but at the same time when she is home she does school work and helps out with supper. I think that she feels the same way Anna does but doesnt want to admit it. With her doing all of these things she has no time to miss her mom, dad, or even Paul.
She works hard for her family. She went to school, worked for four hours after, then had to help her aunt with dinner, after she had homework that must be completed. She had no time to finish the essay.
She is wanting to make everything good for her and her family because her dad is gone, so she is working very hard to keep up. But it is alot of work and she is having trouble getting everything done in time. Like she came from school and went straight to the resturant to work for four hours, then straight home to help her aunt make supper, and then had to try to get a essay done and she didn't have a topic yet.
Rose seems to be a very kind and caring person and wants to help other people. ''Anna,' Rose said.'what's wrong? You feel okay?''
She is a very hard worker. She works four hours at her job then comes home to help make supper and then writes her essay.
Rose seems like a truthfull person because she tells Anna about their dad being gone for only four months and that he is making better money.
Rose did not want to hurt her Aunt. She doesn't like hurting people. So she wasn't going to tell her Aunt that she felt so weighed down by what she was doing for her family.
Hardworking. Rose is a very hard working individual. She has school, work, housework, and homework. She takes on more responsibilites than she can probably handle but she does it all for the good of the family. You can see Rose's hardworking efforts as she goes above and beyond to win a essay contest. She puts more on her plate than she can eat but she takes every challenge head on. You can tell she is working hard from the stress that is related to us through her character. She is strong for her sister, making everything seem just peachy, but right when she has the chance, she breaks down to her Aunt, let's her know how she really feels.
One trait that can describe Rose is hardworking. Whether she wants to do something or not, she still gets it done. An example from the story is the fact that she goes to school, works a four- hour shift right after, home to help her aunt  prepare supper, and then does homework.
Rose was very busy on a normal day to day basis. I know this because of how stressed she is that she does not have time to write her paper, because of school, work, preparing supper, and doing homework.
Rose is heart felt girl who cannot let the past go due to some excructiating experiences as a young girl. Rose has re-occurring dreams about things of her brother. An example would be she has a vision of her brother recieving his diploma and she also has a dream of her brother jumping from a boulder and sinking down upon herself as if he was made of stone.
One trait that can describe Rose based on her converstations with Anna is that she knows how to push things to the side that she knows upsets her deep down and say what she thinks the true facts are.  One example from the story that shows this is when Anna and Rose are talking about her father being gone and to Anna it seemed like it had been years that he had been gone.  Rose jus responded with a simple answer of, 'It's only been four months.'
That Rose didnt answer if she told the truth or not
Rose said ' What's wrong? You feel okay?' that is a trait of love.
Rose is a rather optimistic person. Although she is very stressed out due to the work she must do daily, she seems hopeful that all her efforts will pay off, whether it be for Paul, her parents, or herself.
Rose feels very weighed down because she has too much on her plate and it drives her insane because she also has to do a bunch for her family too and she feels presured not to give up and to help as much as she can and I know this because of when she had that conversation with her aunt at the end she had her aunt explain what she was feeling in a different perspective.
Rose is very selfless, she shows this by not saying how she really felt when she was asked by her aunt. Instead of hurting her aunt and mother she kept it to herself.
Rose is very caring about her family. She sacrificed so much time to get a job and help pay, along with her family, to get her brother through college. Of course, it doesn't mean that she is happy about it all the time, but she still does care and wants to try somehow to help as much as she can.
She don't like to her peoples feelings because she don't tell her anut the truth about whats really makes her feel weigh down by what shes doing to help her family.
Even if I win, she thought, I won't get to travel to Sacarmento to recieve the prize.
To try to confort her the people that she see in dis stress. in the story she tries to make a  joke on how money isn't every thing to poeple that have everything.
She hides her feelings so she doesnt upset others, like when she didn't want to tell the truth and hurt her Aunt.
It is easily surmisable from the text that Rose can be described as burdened.  It is enough proof to deduce her burdened and troubled mind set when the story describes her dreams as she feels that the weight of her brother is crashing down on her.
One trait that I saw in Rose during her conversation with Anna is that she is a positive person she is telling her sister the positive things that will come out of it. Also, that even though she feels weighed down by everything she is still keeping her head up and staying positive. For example, Rose said to Anna, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
Rose is a nervous person, she's saying, 'even if i win, i wount get to travel to Sacramento to recieve the prize.
Rose and Anna both have a hard time writting an essay. When they get mad they don't want to do it anymore and they walk off.
Rose is paranoid. She is paranoid with how her life is going with her mother working late and her father moving away to work somewhere else.  This is shown when she keeps having bad dream.
'I feel asleep working on my essay,' Said Rose                                               Rose was doing her essay and she feel asleep and had a bad dream and she woke up scared and Anna ask if she was ok and Rose said yaq i am ok.
One trait I identified was that she was more preoccupied with what was going on with her then however eveybody else felt.A detail from the story is when Rose ignored what her sister had to say and went on about her essay. She was more concerned about the essay then Rose's bad dream or how she was feeling.
The one trate I would identify Rose with would be understanding. She shows this trait when she explains to Anna why Papa had to leave.
I think she is desolate and worn out. She works all the time to help her family and has no time for herself.
Rose feels overworked and wants an easier life. This based on when Aunt Kolab asked her if it's difficult for her to imagine life in Cambodia.
Rose is very responsible. She spends her days at school, then going to work, then preparing supper, and then doing homework. She is dutiful because she is trying to prepare for her future at college and helping Paul pay for his.
One trait that can describes rose based on a conversation with Aunt Kolab is that you can really feel what Rose is actually feeling. You can almost make a connection, with Rose and how she has to deal with life, for example in the passage it says if she told the truth she would hurt her Aunt. So you get a feeling of how Rose feels on the inside too. You feel that she really cares for her family and doesn't want to upset anyone.
Rose has a great trait, the trait she has is will-power. Rose does a lot for the family and she doesn't really ask for anything in return.'Rose didn't answer one of Aunt Kolab's questions because she didn't want to hurt her feelings.'
Rose is an caring person who cares about others and how they feel and she is not self-centered. She is an trustworthy person and is very reliable. And she tends to be shy sometimes but she overcomes it a little bit.
Rose is under a lot of pressure.Paragraph 3 says she has to write a flawless three-thousand word essay.
She had a lot of flash backs, and it was coming all back to her sister because it was about her brother.
Rose is a very afraid to let any one down.  This trait is both good and bad for her personality.  It is a good thing because, she is always there when someone needs something.  She would do anything to help someone around her.  It is bad because as Rose's dream shows us; Rose can be taking on to much and doesn't know how to let it all go, and tell people she can't handle it.
Rose is very well at thinking before she speaks. In paragraph 19, she thaught about what to say because she did not want to hurt her aunt.
Rose is a caring person. She wants her family to be well of and live a good life. She did not want to hurt her aunt by telling her that she felt weighed down by all she does. Rose was trying to calm her sister when she was sulking about missing their father. I see Rose as a caring girl.
One trait that can discribe Rose is she woulod like everything to be her way and if it does not go her way she does not wont to do it.'Ann is mom home yet .' 'Rose know i wish she would come home earlyer and not late all the time dad never did that and that would help me a lot if she came home earlyer.'
Rose is the type of person that is afraid to tell the truth if she thinks that it is going to hurt someone elses feelings.  The reason I say this is because in paragraph nineteen it says, Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probabaly her aunt would tell her mother.
When Rose is talking to Anna after anna pours two glasses of orange juice, Rose says that she is lonesome for Papa. He has been gone for four months which seems like he had been gone for years.
She works really hard and its for her family. She would do anything for her family and they would do the same for her.She is over working herself though. She needs to get her essay done and work at the restaurant and help cook at her house. But she does it anyway.For her brother.
In her conversation with Aunt Kolab, we can see that Rose is tactful because she does not tell her aunt the truth for fear that she would hurt Aunt Kolab's feelings or that the aunt would tell Rose's mother and it would hurt her mother's feelings.
Rose is not a person who will easily express her feelings. In her conversation with Anna, she sounded like she was perfectly content and not stressed by the fact that she has to help Paul get through college. It takes a strange dream and some probing by Aunt Kolab to get her to reveal her true feelings about the situation.
I think that Rose is strong. In the story, it says that she was talking to her sister in the kitchen and that she was trying to help her sister understand their situation and help her come to better terms with it even though she felt the same way.
I think that at the end of the story she finally understandsthe strength of her culture and how her aunt was using it to make her feel better and lighter.
One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab is that she is worried. She is worried that her older brother is going to weigh her down. The dream in which Paul sinks like a rock on top her supports my answer.
They are both kinda upset that their dad had to go to Los Angelous for his work.  They both knew that he was making more money that ever.
One trait that I can see in Rose is that she doesn't want to her her aunt by telling her the truth.  Also, by listening to her Aunt Kolab she is starting to think her life might get easier.  I think the reason is her Aunt Kolab seems to help people see the good in life.
One trait that can describe Rose's trait would be while shes listening to Aunt Kolab. She doesn't directly answer her aunt cause she's afraid of hurting her aunt, or her aunt telling her mother. For instance Aunt Kolab says 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose only nodded.
she is a busy body, cause she always has stuff to do.
BUSY'When would she have time to squeeze writing into her schedule
she is always busy
Rose showed that she is very understanding when she had her conversation with Aunt Kolab. As her aunt helps her think of other things and helps her keep her hope up by pointing out the bright side of things, Rose nods away at what Aunt Kolab says. Although she still questions it in her head, she understands that maybe there is still something for her in her future.
That she is worried about her family.
Rose seems to be very kind. She didn't want her aunt to feel bad and also stuck up for her dad in her conversation with Anna.
Rose is a very busy girl. She has to deal with being in high school, having a job, helping her Aunt Kolab with house work, and she has to write a three thousand word essay.
One trait that can descibe rose based on her conversations is that she is caring.  I think Rose is caring because her young sister is sad because she misses her dad.  Rose tries to comfort her and tries to tell her that their dad had to go away to make more money.
She grew up here and here mom and everybody else grew up in Cambodia. She has a dream that her brother is a heavy weight sinking  her down to the bottom of a body of water, and that gives her the oppurnity to see the situation through someone elses eyes.
Based on her conversation with Anna, Rose can be described as caring because she puts her sister's needs before her own. Although she needs to write a three thousand word essay, she is more concerned that her sister had a bad dream and is missing their father.
Rose is very thankful. Even if what her aunt offered did not work it still make a difference in how she felt. What her aunt did was take some stress away and give Rose a little hope.
One trait that Rose has is that she understands some things have to be sacrificed for the better of the family.  This appears when she is talking with Anna in the kitchen after they both wake up.  Anna says, 'I'm so lonesome for Papa.  It seems like he's been gone for years,' (para. 8).  Rose's response is, 'He had to go.  The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here,' (para. 9).  This shows that for her age and the amount of responsibility she has, she still understands that the sacrifice for a family is the most important thing of all.
Rose can be described by hopeful.  She is hoping or wanting more to come out of the future.  When Rose and Anna are talking at the beginning of the story, Rose talks about how once Paul finishes college, he will get a good job and help support the rest of the family and help pay for both of them to go to college.
Rose was nice to her sister at first, But then kinda got angry. In the story they were talking about their dad, and Rose made Anna mad.
I feel like rose is very stressed. In the second paragraph, the first sentence, rose talks about how most of her days were long and too demanding. Then it describes in the third paragraph how she doesn't feel like she will have time to squeeze in her essay.
Personally, I believe that Rose is sincere. She is trying to help her family, to the best of her ability, but she is heavily weighed down by circumstances. In this story, Rose goes through her to-do list for a typical evening. You would think that the list would be much shorter for someone her age, but then you realize what she has to sacrifice to keep her family going. I wish we could all have her sincerety.
The one trait that Rose has is to work hard fo rher family to get by without some of her family memebers. I get this support because her sister and her have a talk about mone yand that her dad is gone and her mother works a long shift just to get money for them to survive.
One trait that describes Rose is a hard worker.  She goes to school every day, then goes to wrork, and eventually she comes home and only has time to do homework.  She still get everything done and that is why Rose is a hard worker.
she isnt very happy
I would say Rose is an understanding person. In the story you can tell she just wants the best for her family. She is understanding of why her father has to live in L.A. and why her mother has to work so late. She is trying to win a prize for an essay but realizes she might not be able to travel to get. She is a determined bright young girl who is very understanding.
Rose seems to understand that everything she is in the best interest of her and her family, but the pressure only weighs down on her more. This is prevalent when she is speaking with her sister, Anna. Despite the feelings of stress bearing down on her, she explains their current situation to her sister calmly and sincerely.
She seems hopeful, even though she has it rough. When she was telling her sister about how Paul was gonna help them after he graduated college and got a good job, Anna was the one acting grouchy and like she didn't really believe it was going to work out.
She seems iritated and tired, because in the story she wakes up and says oh, no and groaned. This shows that she is very unpleased and that she is very tired and irritable.
She cares about others. She didn't answer her aunt because, she didn't want to hurt her.
She is determined to help the family but feels to young to take on the challenge of growing up so fast.
she is tiered of all the pressure that she is on like takeing care of her family, and writing 1000 word essay, than the pressure for paul.
Rose tells Anna and Aunt Kolab that she is in some way being weighed down. Rose had a dream that Paul was holding her down.
Rose is the kind of person that is very straight forward bout things. In the passage she tells her sister things that she may not wanna hear.
I believe that in the story Rose is a very brave responsibal girl. During the story she is charged with taking care of her familuy while also living in a new country.
In the story the conversation with rose and aunt Kolab would describe Rose as a helping person. She dosen't mind helping out in the family but, meanwhile at the end of the day she feels exhausted and wish she could tell her aunt but not in a way that will hurt her or her mother.
Rose is dismissive and a little passive. She answers her aunt truthfully, but only with non-verbal communication. This shows shes dissmissve for the subject.
Rose appears to feel overwhelmed by everything that is thrown at her- a rough job, taxing schoolwork, and a homelife that takes up most of the time she has that would normally be free to anyone else. '...From school she'd gone straight to the  restaurant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After that it was time to do homework.'
Well she is caring and nice.
Rose is exhausted but she is too nice to let anyone know when she talks to Aunt Kolab. She is caring because she didnt tell the truth because she didnt want to hurt her aunt or her mother.
concernedi think she is concerned for her family and how her brother is the one that has to be the one that suports her and her little sister anna. she says she is concerned about her mother having to work so late .
Rose seems to be worried about money in her coversation with Anna, a detail that supprts this when she brings up the fact that her dad is making more money now , away from them, than he did with them.
In the passage 'Crossing Over', Rose has many different traits, but the trait that is most evident to me is her mother like responsibility. When Anna wakes up from a bad dream Rose checks on her and asks her 'What's wrong?' This suggest that she is wanting to take care of Anna. Then when Rose is talking to her Aunt Kolab, her lets the reader know that Rose has a big resposibility with the family. When her aunt says, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'. This implies to the reader that she has a lot of resposibility to take care of the family. The two examples that are given are small but imply much more that, Rose is almost like a second mother for her family.
Rose is
One trait that can describe Rose is that she never get angry at the people she loves. Rose and Anna have to help Paul finish college and when Paul is out of college he'll pay for Rose and Anna.
One trait that Rose shows is compasion. She cares about everything that her family has had to work for to get to the United States. Rose knows that she needs to work hard just like her brother did to gradutate. She does so many things to be accomplished that she doesn't care how stressed out she is. All she wants is a good life for her and her family.
Rose feels wieghed down by everything and trying to help out the family all the time. When her aunt asks her if she feels weighed down she does not answer.
Rose is responsible when it says 'from school she'd gone straight to the restaurent to work a four-hour shitft' this shows he responsibilty and what position she holds in her family.
Rose feels like she is being weighed down and can't help her family. When Rose is asked by momma if she is weighed down and she looks at her and just walks away ignoring her.
In the tory, when Rose said to Anna when paul graduates he will get a good job and help afford to send them to college. This shows a trait of being optimistic. Also, whe talking to her aunt, although she said things probably won't get much better, she stayed on the plus said and said, maybe they will.
One trait that can describe Rose is that she cares about what is right for the family instead of what she wants because when Anna said she doesn't care about money and she wants Papa home, thats being self-centered.  Rose shows the positive side of her father being gone and just accepts it and is willing to keep helping the family.
Rose is unhappy, and supresses her feelings of how she really feels to make others feel better. She doesn't want others to see her as someone who can only take so much. An example of this is when Rose's sister walks into the room she acts as if falling asleep while working on an essay that is important to her is okay. She tells Anna that they need to do this for thier brother, and that in the end he can help them get to where they want to be. She also jokes about money with Anna as if things were alright with money at this time.
The one trait I think that describes rose is, that she is caring. I say this because, when she was talking to her aunt, she wanted to tell her the dream she had. She ended up not telling her aunt beacause she thought it would hurt her.
Rose seems like a very open person. She uses personification when the narrator said, 'Rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream, to expose it so it would loosen its grip on her.' This just tells you that her and her aunt would talk about it openly.
Rose is caring. Her conversation with Anna shows this. Rose asks Anna if she feels okay.
During her conversation with Aunt Kolab, Rose doesn't tell her how she feels. This shows great responsibility because she knows that it is part of her job to help her brother. She also says that to Anna, that he is the one that can help them get to college.She is willing to sacrifice her time to help her brother achieve his goal of graduating from college.
One trait that can describe rose is respectful because when Aunt Kolab asked her 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family' Rose doesn't say anything because she did not want to hurt her Aunt's feelings or her mothers.
She is very sincere and thinks about other people's and cares about other people's feelings. Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.
Rose feels weighed down because of how much she's trying to help her family. She feels like she has to carry most of the problems. In the conversation Rose has with her Aunt Kolab towards the end of the story her Aunt specifically asks her if she feels weighed down by what she's doing to help her family and Rose doesn't answer. It gives proof that she does not want to tell her Aunt or her mother.
They are in the same family and like roses
rose had a talk with her aunt and it made her ffeel alot better then she actually felt
Anna is very hardworking.  She says that she works a shift at a job somewhere.  She also has to keep a veil of confidence up for her younger sibling in order to keep her from being frightened.
Rose is frustrated, i think shes frusterated because she has a very big essay to do and no parents to help her and she has to take care of her little sister.
Rose is a girl who is always putting her family first. Though she fights with her sister and has terrible dreams about the weight put on her shoulders that she explains to her aunt, she still always tries to put her family first. She takes the dreams shes been having and relates them to everyday life in Cambodia and later finds a topic for a state championship essay that would help her family out greatfully.
Rose talks to her sister Anna and they start getting in a argument about there family and money.  Rose doesn't like that her mom works so late and her dad had to move so he could get a better job for his family.  Anna said it helps them a lot because of the money they make, but all Rose wants to do is see her dad and mom more.
She is very brave. It takes alot of courage to write a long essay like that and have to present it at a state competition. She is also brave for talking to her aunt about what is going on.
Rose tries to put things lightly so that she wont hurt others feelings. This becomes apparent when she is talking to Anna about their father and trying to comfort Anna.
Rose works too much she works after school and has to do her homework and come back and take care or her bothers and sisters.
I could tell that she was up set with the way that things were happening to her. Her aunt sees that and offers to make some stuff to sell that comes from her country.
One trait to describe Rose would be guilt because of the dream she has about Paul jumping off the boulder and landing on her in the water.
In Rose's conversation with Anns she seems very passive and not engaged in the situation. When she explains to Ana that 'He had to go. The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here' it is apparent that she is telling her this just to make her stop worrying. Rose does not really intend to comfort her sister in their conversation.
She understands how important school is
Based on her conversation with Anna, Rose is an understanding person. Anna is still young so she can not fully understand why her family is working so hard. Rose explains to her its for the enitire family; for her brother and themselves. Rose overworks herself with school and work but she knows its for her family so keeps on perservering, ignoring the fact that she feels too much responsibility for her age.
Rose, judging by her unwillingness to speak about how she felt to her Aunt Kolab, works as hard as she does because she does not wish to let her family down.
When Rose is talking to her Aunt Kolab, her aunt tells Rose that now she can tell that Rose is seeing the problems and situations through other eyes. I think what she is saying is that now Rose is seeing life in a new perspective, that now she doesn't just think that their family is having a hard time financially, that now she knows by trying to be a part of the problems and help to resolve them.
One trait to describe Rose would be optimistic. In paragraph 11, Rose is talking to Anna about money and Rose makes the comment that their part is help Paul finish college so he can get a good job and then help them go to college. Their family is having problems and their dad just moved away to have a better paying job and Rose is looking on the bright side and how the outcome will be good if they just don't give up.
Rose was a procrastinator, in the story she put off writing her essay until last minute then she couldn't think of anything to write.
She thinks its all about money.Anna glared at Rose. 'Money isn't everything.'     'Only if you already have verything,' Rose said.
One trait that can describe Rose is hardworking. The story shows this when it talks about how most of her days are long when she has to go to school, then the restaurant, then home to help with dinner, and finally to do homework. This relates to her conversation with Aunt Kolab when her Aunt can see how hard she is working and how exhausted she is when Rose comes down in the morning. Her Aunt then askes her is she feels weighed down by what she is doing to help the family.
Rose is very willing to persevere and accompolish her goals.One could seen this in the end when she is talking to Aunt Kolab,   'Rose kept nodding.  Mayber her life would get easier.'
Rose doesnt like to say her true feelingsParagraph 21 line 1 and paragraph 23 line 1 it says she just keeps on nodding.
Rose, to me, seems like a very understanding person. She listens to her sister when she is resentfull about there father and mother, and tries to explain it so that she can better understand the situation herself. Rose also shows that she is understanding when her aunt comes to her with more ideas on ways to help out there older brother Paul.
Rose's sense of responsibity is evident in her conversation with Anna. her ability to suppress her own feelings to try and make things easier for her sister is a great personal trait.
Rose is a very determined person. You can tell this from the story, because she is working hard in the resturant, making dinner for her family at home, and writing an essay to try to get a college scholarship all at the same time. By reading conversations she had with her Aunt Kolab you can tell she is a very determined and hardworking person. Aunt Kolab says , 'Do you feel weighed down by what your doing to help this family?' also shows that Rose is a very determined person.
She is hopeful that her future will be worth the work she puts in. She just needs to make out of this rough patch in life.
Rose is caring and trys to comfort her sister Anna, when Anna is down because her parents are never home. Rose says to Anna in the story that 'He had to go. The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here.' Rose was trying to tell her sister it was important for their father to go away.
Rose, to me, seems to be a very hard working person. In the story she tells us she has work most days right after school, then help with dinner, and finally do homework. By this point in the story you can already tell she is a busy just trying to please everyone. She doesn't like that she is also so busy but because she is a hard working person, she is making sure she never disapoints her family. She knows they have given so much and continue to work hard so her and her younger sister have an education.
'I'm so lonesome for Papa. It seems like he's been gone for years.' 'It's only been four months.' This tells me that Rose is a family girl. She is not happy unless her family is with her and supporting her. She is not happy about her dad having to leave for a job in Los Angeles.
She is strong inside, because even under pressure she tries to help her family.
Rose is a harworking young woman who would do most anything to protect her family.  Rose puts aside her life in order to help her brother through school.  She works instead of plays so that her brother can get through school and take care of her rather than the other way around.
One trait that that can decscribe Rose based on her conversation with Anna would be worried. My example from the context would be, 'Anna,' Rose said. 'What's wrong? You feel okay?'
She is very hardworking, and she cares about her family. In the story it says that after school she went straight to work and straigh home to help prepare supper.
She in a way feels like she cares about the essay but if she does win than she cant pick up the prize anyway so she feels that there isnt realy a point in trying to win and her schedual is already realy busy as it is.
Anna is from Cambodia, but grew up in the United States and she is seeing stuff diffrent then her Aunt who grew up in Canbodia.
Rose is a very responsible girl. She has more of a load on her than most girls her age would. She worries about money, her brother, and her father. Her Aunt Kolab says that what they are doing is normal in Cambodia. This makes Rose feel better and relieves her of some of the stresses that she feels in everyday life.
I think that Rose is a caring person and that is why she always tries to make everyone else feel better. Rose wouldn't tell Aunt Kolab she felt a big weight on her doing everything she had to do because she didn't want to hurt her feelings.
Caring, when she is talking to Anna she does as much as she can to be nice and comfort her about what is happening.
Rose thinks that there is something wrong with Anna.
Rose is a hard working lady, that wants to do good things for herself.She is wanting to write this three thousand word essay, but cant fit it into her schedule. She wants to become a winner.
I think she's affraid to tell people what's wrong with her. If there is something bothering her, she would rather keep it to herself and deal with it other tham telling somebody about it that will help her.
One trait of Rose seen in her conversation with Anna is a selfish trait.  Anna is attempting to confide in Rose, but Rose just pulls the conversations topic back to herself.
One trait that can be used to descripe Rose, is positive. Rose is always looking towards the bright side of each situation, no matter how bad the conditions. Also, she keeps a strong attitude when her little sister talks to her about her feelings and problems.
she is responsible . she has to do all these things such as  school, work, then home to make dinner. shes overworked
One trait that describes rose is hard-working. I chose this word because she not only goes to school,but she also works.
Rose is slightly bitter. A supporting fact is when she was talking to Anna after she had a bad dream. She tried to laugh but it sounded fake even to her.
Rose is a thoughtful person, she doesn't answer her Aunt Kolab so that she doesn't hurt her.
Rose is a carring person; when her sister came into her room she took her down stairs and gave a glass of orange juice to calm her down.
Rose is a the type of girl that wants to do anything possible to please everyone she knows. She wants to be known as dependable. The one detail that comes to my mind is when Rose is thinking about writing that essay eventhough she is very busy with working but she wants to win the prize.
Rose tries to hide how she really feels. When she talks to Anna, she tries to sound reassuring even though she is worried. For example, she tries 'a laugh that sounded fake even to her.'
Rose is very dedicated to her family. An example of this is when Anna says 'You sound just like Mama.'
She acts like her mom and says the same things. Her sister told her she sounded just like their mom.
Anna is very courageous. She doesn't mind working hard for the family even though it might hurt her. An example of this is how she works a four hour shift after school to bring in money to help pay for her brother's schooling.
A trait that Rose can be described by is realistic.  She realizes the importance of her dad taking a job in Los Angeles because it pays three times more than what he was making.  She knows that the money will go to good use by putting his children through college.
Hard-working; Rose understands that she and her family must work hard to get what they need in life. She works hard to help pay for her brother's college knowing that once he has finished school and gets a good job he will help pay for her college. In paragraph 11 she states this.
Rose is very considerate. Although she probably resents that her father must get a job in Los Angeles, she understands the greater goal behind his reasoning and tries to explain it to Anna. She knows that all of her family members need to help each other succeed.
Rose care about what everyone thinks.  She listened to Anna and helped her get over her bad dream.  She also cared about what Aunt Kolab had to say because she was trying to make live better for Rose.
Persistent.
In the story Rose feels depressed as if she has no way out. This gives her the trait that she is confused about her family.
She acts scared from her dream when she saw Paul sinking in the water on  top of her and she couldnt get out from under him
shes needs to be more open with her aunt instead of being scared
Rose is a realist. This is because after Anna says 'Money isn't everything.' Rose says 'Only if you have everything.'
Fatigued, at the beginning of the story she has a hard time staying awake because her daily schedule is so demanding.
fiesty ' you sound just like mama'. she stood and stalked out
That she puts stuff off till the last minute. My proof of this is 'I fell asleep working on my essay,'
She does not want to write her three thousand word paper.  She has two conversations with people but yet she doesn't work on her paper.
Her aunt talk about how life going to change.
Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.
Rose is obviously an optomistic person. During her conversation with Anna in the kitchen, she talks about how she thinks her brother will find a good job after college, and then pay for their college. This is a positive view that an optomistic person would have.
Rose is haveing to act more like an adult to help support the family and the wishes thay have for their younger brother. She showes that when she talks about being so busy with school, work, house chores, and then homework.
She is very smart and knows what she is talking about. Because in the story she talks as if she is a grown up and she actually knows what she is saying.
Although they have different views on life, Rosa is able to relate with everyone by understanding the way they think.
One trait that describes Rose based on her converstions with Aunt Kolab is that she is very respectful of her family. In paragraph eighteen she want's to tell Aunt Kolab how she feels but doesn't.
Rose is wanting someone to take care of her. Example is that when her brother gets out of college she said he will take care of us.
Rose asked her younger sister if she was ok and asked why she was up so early? Her sister said because I had a bad dream.
Rose doesn't want to let her family down but she feels obligated to keep quiet and not tell anyone how she feels. It's weighting her down and stressing her out. In the story Aunt Kolab can sense that Rose feels like she's being weighed down just by her emotions.
Rose is very mature.  She has numerous responsiblities, but she is mature enough to see how imperative it is that she complete them; she does not try to push all of her responsibilities onto someone else.
One trait that can describes Rose in her talk with Aunt Kolab would be attentive. Rose was attentive when she kept listening and nodding to what her Aunt Kolab was telling her.
In paragraph 11, Rose states to Anna that they both have a part in helping their brother Paul through college, and in return he will put them through college. This shows that Rose is generous. She knows that by doing all she can to help her brother, he will return the favor to not only her, but her sister Anna also.
Rose is a positive person. She thinks the best of each situation, and hopes and dreams that things will get better. In the story, Rose told Anna that Paul would pay for her and Anna's schooling once he got a good job and earned a lot of money.
She wants to be selfish but know she can't so she does small selfish acts like ignoring Anna.  ''Anna,' Rose said. 'What's wrong? You feel okay?''I'm fine,' her sister said. 'I just had another bad dream.''I fell asleep working on my essay,' Rose said.'
Rose is kinda like the mother figure in this story. she has alot of responsibilies to take care of.  in paragraph 14 line 2 she says she felt too young for so much responsibilty..
Rose has a trait that makes her look like she is not confident in herself. In paragraph 11 when she was talking to Anna, Rose said that 'She tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her'. This tells you that Rose is not confident in what she says, because if she was she would have laughed like she meant it to cheer up her sister. This also means that she is not confident in what she does, because she thinks that she can not get her essay done in time and turned in. At the end of the story in paragraph 23 however Rose does get some confidence in her, and thinks of an idea for her essay.
SHE IS A HARD WORKER.  SHE GOES TO WORK RIGHT AFTER SCHOOL FOR A FOUR HOUR SHIFT THEN GOES HOME HELPS WITH SUPPER AND THEN FINISHES UP WITH HER HOMEWORK.
'It's only  been four months,' Rose said as gentily as she could. 'He had to go. The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here.'
Rose seems very responsible. She is taking care of her sister alot, and looking out for her brother like in paragraph fourteen. 'She felt too young fo so much responsibility.'
Based on her conversastions with Anna and Aunt Kolab, the reader knows that Rose is a very understanding young women.  During her conversastion with Anna, Rose explains that Papa had to go to Los Angelos so that he can support the family.  She understands what he had to give up to go work there, and she knows that he is doing it for the good of the family.  Rose also understands that she needs to keep her job. in order to help support the family.  She understands that even if she does win the essay contest she will not be able to travel to Sacramanteo.  She cannot attend because she is willing to work to keep her job.
Rose is mean towards her little sister.Anna is being a good sister, and a good friend to check up on her older sister and make sure that she`s alright. Thats what family suppose to do.
I think that Rose is loving. When she was talking to Anna all she tried to do was cheer her up. That is the sign of a girl that really cares about her family and wants the best for them
Based on the convestations Rose had with Anna I would describe Rose as supportive. Rose is trying to convince Anna that what their family is doing is really what is best for all of them. She has to support Paul and her parents in the choices they are making.
Rose is a very optimistical person. She looks to the bright side of things when talking to her aunt.
Rose is caring. Even thought she didnt sleep much and works hard during the day and into the night she still has time to ask Anna if something is wrong.
That though she is worried about something she is understanding about what is going on in her life and that is waht allows her to deal with the problems in front of her.
I think that Rose feels very overwhelmed because she has a job, on top of school, on top of a three thousand word essay, on top of helping her brother get to school, on top of being a good role model for her sister. There are lots of things that Rose has to be doing.
She thought maybe her life would get easier.
Rose is very blunt with Anna. When Anna told Rose, 'Money isn't everything.' Roses's response was, 'Only if you already have everything.'
One trait that she has is that she isn't someone that is going to give up easly. She shows this by working a four hour shift and still helping out her aunt while worrying about an essay that is due soon.
Busy but wants her aunt to be happy, like at the end of the story she starts suggesting other things for her aunt to do to make money, because she feels like she's un happy.
Rose was a caring niece and daughter because she did not want to hurt her Aunt nor her mother by admitting that she felt weighed down by what she was doing for her family. Rose did not reply to her Aunt's question if she was feeling weighed down for this reason.
shes kind of snoby
One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversation with Anna is that she believes money is everything.  Anna said 'money isn't everything', and Rose said, 'Only if you already have everything.'
One trait to describe Rose is nice and thoughtful. an example from the story is that when she is talkin to her sister sh does her best to make her sister feel better about the situation and help not feel so bad.
Rose is loyal to her family. She feels pressure but still feels the need to help the best way she can. When Rose spoke to her sister about why their father had to leave, telling her the job in Los Angrles paid more, it shows that she is loyal to her family members actions.
Rose see's things differently then her aunt and parents, in the story her aunt said 'you're seeing the situation through other eyes-as you should because you grew up here.'
she is a vary good person she help the famaly.
That she don't like to talk to people about how she feels. 'Anna,'Rose said. 'what's worng? You feel okay?''I'm fine,' her sister said. ' I just had another bad dream'
I see Rose as being a Stubborn little girl that was very close to her dad, but when he had to go away for his new and better paying job they grew apart which made her really lonely
Rosa has many traits. One trait she has is greed. In her conversation with Anna she does not seem to care that her dad is gone. All she seems to care about is the money.
Cambodian tradition and sense or family, she realized,could survive an ocean crossing.
Anna doesn't want to hurt her families feelings by tellin them what she thinks, and that makes her seem nice.
Rose is hopeful in the story she realizes maybe her life would get easier.
responsible
Rose is very thoughtful, she is always thinking of the future and is worrying about other people and not just herself. Rose is thinking of how she's going to get to college when her family has no money. Rose doesnt want to move to Cambodia and her aunt understands that. Rose is being thoughful when she doesn't tell her aunt the dream becasue it would hurt her feelings.
Rose is trying to comfort her little sister by asking her if she is okay when she saw Anna rubbing her eyes.
She is afraid to speak her mind
I believe that Rose is doing a lot for the family, and is stressed out about everything she is doing. As Aunt Kolab said, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' In return tells me that Rose is stressed out not only about the family, but about school also. With the three thousand word essay she has to write, and also her family she helps take care of.
She is hardworking. I can see that from the conversation she has with her little sister Anna. In that conversation she talks about how it was their duty to pay off Paul's college loans. She isn't indifferent or mad, she only has one thing in mind, and that is that she and her family will pay off the loans and things will be better.
Rose doesn't want to hurt anyone's feelings. During the conversation between Rose and Aunt Kolab, Rose is asked if she feels 'weighed down' by everything she has to do to help her family. Rose does not answer this question, because she doesn't want to hurt her aunt's feelings.
Rose is conflicted. In her conversation with Anna, she realizes that she is helping to pay for her brother's college, even though she doesn't want to do the work.
Rose is always busy and has no free time to do anything, because Rose tells her Aunt Kolab that about her dream. Aunt Kolab asks if Rose is weighed down because of the family, but she doesn't respond.
Rose is clearly open and feels her Aunt is trustworthy. When she has that bad dream she goes straight to her to let it off her chest. She has a good relationship with her Aunt in which case she could express her feelings to help herself.
Rose feels helpless in her situation to help pay for her brother's college. This is shown in her dream when she is drowning from the weight of her brother.
shes stubern
One trait would be courage. Courage, because she decided to tell her aunt about the dream and let her aunt know that she was being very over worked.
From reading this passage and Rose's conversation with Aunt Kolab, I believe that Rose is very self contained. She seems to keep her thoughts and feelings to herself so she doesn't hurt the thoughts and feelings of another person.
optomistic. then he'll get a good job, anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.
Rose is hard working to help her family in need from Aunt Kolab point of view.
Rose seems like the type of person that is nice, but doesn't want too share her feelings because shes afraid of hurting other people.
Rose respects her elderes and doesnt want to hurt their feelings.  Because when she is talking to her aunt she didnt want to tell the truth and hurt her feelings.
Rose is someone who feels like the weight of the world is one her shoulders you can see this in paragraph 14 sentence 2, 'Paul's fate lie partly in these.'
Rose cares, she is worried about other rather thank just herself. When Anna had stated that she felt like their father had been gone for years, Rose reasurred her that it had not been that long.
Rose is a depresd person. When doesn't want to ever talk about what is truly wrong.
Rose is stressed throughout the story. When she wakes from her dream, and Aunt Kolab comes into the room, Rose feels she needs to talk about what is going on in her mind. When asked if she feels weighed down by what she is doing for the family, she answers yes.
Rose doesn't like to hurt anybody. When she was taliking to Anna, she wanted to make Anna feel better by telling her about how her dad will be back, and get a better job to pay for Anna's and her's college. When her aunt asked her if she felt weighed down by this situation, she didn't want to tell her aunt the truth not to hurt her, and she also thinks that Aunt Kolab will tell her mom, and it will hurt her mom too.
She's very helpful, going to school and then a four hour shift and then coming home to make supper. And then to do her homework. She's really trying to help her family out.
That she feels forced into what shes doing and wants a easier wayand time for herself. During the story she felt like she had to squeeze in time to do her essay and have no time to herself
She is very helpful because her aunt asked her if she felt weighed down by her helping the family.
One trait that describes Rose is that she is a hard worker.  One detail from the story is that Rose is constantly busy.
Rose is a deligent person. 'The day, like most of her days, had been too long, too demanding.' Even though her days had been too long, she still made it through each one, doing what she was suppose to do to help her family and herself.
She is stressed. Example When would she squeeze in writing a flawless three-thousand word essay?
One trait that rosa has is that she is a very hard worker you can tell because she falls asleep working on her essay which mean she was not going to school with out it.
Rose is a very hard worker, but is feeling extremely stressed and fatigued by all the tasks she has to complete each day.  In one day, she went to school, worked at the restaurant for a four-hour shift, and then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper, then she finally began writing her three-thousand-word essay.  She wonders if her aunt feels weighed down by her family problems like she does.  She is very stressed and needed someone to talk through her problems with.
Rose seems to have many traits in this story. But the one that sticks out the most to me is being independent. Rose has a lot of different obstacles but she seems to be alone. Even though she is not forced she feels it has to be done and without her everything will fail. Anna seems to help her refocus and give her some positive feedback but Rose just seems to get even more upset and become once again independent about her issues. An example from the story would be 'Anna,' Rose said. ' What's wrong? You feel okay? 'I'm fine,' her sister said.
Rose is surrounded by lots of things and is having to grow up fast. She does not have that much time on her hands ever. Rose has to struggle with the fact that Anna is upset about there father and that there is alot of things having to be done, which she can not do everything.
When Rose speaks with Anna you can tell that she wants to be hopeful. She says that Paul getting a job will allow money for her and Anna to go to college, but the fake laugh shows that she is sceptical just like Anna.
One trait from the story that describes Rose is her understanding  like where she was okay with her dad beeing gone because he was helping the family.
She really misses her dad. This is true because his jod includes him to never be home. In the future they hope he has enough money to send them to collage.
'I fell asleep working on my essay' rose means that she is a very very busy girl and don't have time for other stuff.
One trait that would describe Rose based on her conversation with Anna is that she is good with giving her sister hope. By saying to her, 'Then he'll [Paul] get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.', Rose is giving Anna the hope of going to college and having a successful life.
Rose works hard to help her family. Rose is easily pressured from all the work she has to complete. Rose does not want to work as hard, to experience more childhood dreams. She is very concealing of her true feelings and tries to agree with others in her family not wanting to disappoint them. This feeling is evident when she speaks with Anna, trying to laugh at her own joke. Rose's fake laughter amplifies her true feelings.
Anna could be desribed as understanding. When Anna walks in the room, she immediately asks her what the matter is, 'What's wrong? You feel okay?'
'WE have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'This shows that she is an incourager, and also how she is an adult to.
Rose is very exhausted and worried for the family.Rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream, to expose it so it would loosen its grip on her.  'Do you feel so wighed down by what you're doing to help this family.
Rose is emotionally strong and hopefull.  She provides words of encouragement to her little sister when Anna is doubting their family.  She is responsible in the fact that she has a job, goes to school, and helps out around the house when her parents are not there.
Rose has a temper. She has a temper; When talking with Anna. Anna glared at Rose.  'Money isnt everything.' Rose got mad and said you are just like mama then she pushed her chair away from her and got up and stormed out of the kitchen. She was mad.
One trait that best describes Rose is that she is caring.  She is caring because she loves her family and she is willing to work hard so that they can have a better life.
Rose can be described as stressed. When Aunt Kolab says, '...Maybe we can find a way to do things differently. A better way for you,' she is noticing that Rose is very busy, so she wants to help her with her difficulties
She is a laid back, calm girl. She just wants to make others happy and try to keep the peace beteen people. She is a smart young girl that knows what she wants in life.
Rose is positive and kind. I think she is kind because she tries to make others stay positive and see the glass half full. She tries to make others feel as if they are helping and make them feel strong and good about themselves.
One trait is that she seems grateful. One detail is in her conversation with Anna she is defending her parents decision.
Rose is caring for her family. Such as when Rose talks with Anna she tries to encourage her and keep her spirits up.
If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.
Rose can be emberassed. When Rose was talking to her aunt Kolab she just kepted nodding, she didn't say much. that makes me think that she is emberassed.
Strength of will. You can tell she is stressed and hopeless from the first couple paragraphs, she puts on a reassuring demeanor for her younger sister to try and help her morale, then she has this dream and confides in her aunt about her stress. Not once does she even consider giving up, but she wonders how she can do all the things she needs to. I think it is a great feat of strength that she is pressed by all these obligations, but is not crushed.
Rose is responsible, but over works herself.'when would she squeeze in writing a flawless three-thousand word essay?'
she is supportive.'Hmm. Maybe we can find a way to do things differently. A way better for you.' Her aunt's face lit up. 'Maybe I can sew for ladies. Or I could make special treats from our country and sell them.'
When she kept nodding her head, thinking that her life would get easier. That tell us that she care about her family. Cause she work just to get her brother throw college. And she always talking to her family.
I think that Rose is an over thinker. She over thinks things and then makes herself think differently like that she wont be able to do this or be able to do that. ' Im insane.' Rose says. She thinks that she has no time to write this three thousand word essay because she has work and has to help out with the family. She also says that even if she did write the essay she dont tihnk that she would win.
Rose is a good person.
A trait describing Rose is resentful. Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.
Rose is very compassionate to her sister. It's a lot of responsibility to take on when you're mother is not around and you have a little sister to take care of. Rose tries to make her little sister feel better about their situation, even though she is already so weighted down by it.
Rose seem's very stressed, but she handle's it very well. She doesn't give up and she alway's tries to stay looking at the bright side of thing's. Rose show's this when she's talking to Anna and tell's her 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
You can tell that she cares about her little sister. In the story, she tries to calm her little sister down by saying that once they help pay for Paul to graduate, then they will be able to go to college and get good jobs. She's making sure that Anna knows everything will be alright.
That Rose don't only think about herself, she also thinks about others.  She didn't just come out and say I don't like the way we live, because she didn't want to hurt her aunt.  She told her aunt her dream, but didn't say that she was bothered by the way that they live.  She let her aunt do most of the talking and let her aunt see things from her point of view.
Rose feels as though that she is weighed down by someon in their family, and she feels ashamed, so she doesnt answer her aunt. She wants to be able to do and go places in life, but she feels that she willl not be able to do this, under the circumstances she is pu in.
Rose is a young girl in her late teenage years. You can tell that she has s high stress level and while she trys to complete all of her tasks without complaint, that it is something that upsets her a lot. A trait you can see Rose has it that she is very respectful of her family. While she is talking to Aunt Kolab, she did not want to tell her that she is so weighed down with everything she has to do so she did not give a response to her aunt when she asked.
She doesn't think she can be helped very easily.
as stated in story that Rose  kept nodding and maybe her life would get easier and Rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream to expose it
Trough the conversation with Anna gives Rose a Comforting older sister personality. 'I'm so lonesome for Papa. It seems like he's been gone for years.'      'It's only been four months,' Rose said as gently as she could.The dialog and the description of how she tried to say it only proves she is trying to comfort her younger sister.
Through Rose's conversation with Anna, one can tell that Rose cares about family first.
Rose is a leader. She reveals her dream to Aunt Kolab to find out what her dream could have possibly meant. She feels like she has a ton of weight on her shoulders. She also has to take care of her little sister in the meantime.
Rose is overwhelmed. In her conversation with her Aunt Kolab, she admits that she feels tied down by everything she does for her family and that she is not use to it.
She feels like she must be completly responsible; it has caused her to over work herself. She has that dream that Pauls body falls on her and she drowns, signifing that she feels his wieght on her
She seem like she like to keep to herself alot doesn't really care to talk much to people. like when she was talking to her sister she was being short answer with her wasn't really talk to her like normal sister talk.
Rose tries to look on the bright side of things and does not want people to know how she really feels.  Rose has a hefty load to carry, and she feels that if she tells anyone, they would be hurt by her words.
WorrisomShe worries about how Pauls fate lies in her hands partially.
Rose really cares about Anna
Based on her conversation with Aunt Kolab, the reader can tell that Rose is a caring person. She doesn't want to hurt others around her so she keeps many of her feelings inside. In paragraph 19, it shows Rose thinking of others before herself. 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. An probably her aunt would tell her mother.'These lines show how Rose doesn't want to tell her aunt how she is really feeling to keep everyone happy.
she is understanding about the whole situation with her dad because she isnt upset that he left.
one trait is that she could probably one of those workaholic people who only needs or has to work to make it throuh life one example is listed in the entire 2nd paragraph
Rose is caring and wants to help. She is understanding and when talking to her sister and aunt she expresses how she feels but also understands how she needs to help out.
One trait that can describe Rose from the conversation with Aunt Kolab is conflicted.  When Aunt kolab asked Rose if she felt so weighed down by what she does to help her family, and she couln't answer becuase the answer she wanted to say would hurt her aunt and she didn't want that.
One trait to describe Rose is loyal. There are many things she wants for herself in life. She puts that second though. Her family comes first in everything she does. After school she goes to work, then she goes home to help her aunt cook dinner. When all of this is done she finally has her own time to work on homework. All of this is to help her family. Aunt Kolab asks if she is weighted down by all of this work. She doesn't answer truthfully, so they don't know how hard all of it is on her. She puts her family first in everything she does.
Rose is compassionate. This is easy enough to tell from her reaction when Anna walked into the room. Rose immediately took in her sister's body language and asked her what was wrong. She then proceded to try and comfort her sister throughout the conversation by explaining why their parents and others chose to do as they have done.
Based on the story I read, patience is a trait that can be used to describe Rose. Although she has a heavy load on her shoulders, she does not take her stress out on others. When her sister came into her room she calmly asked her if she was okay. Rose was there for her sister and had a civil conversation with her Aunt despite all of the stress she was feeling. Rose is a patient person.
Rose feels as if her life is just going to get somewhat worse then what it is but at the same time it might get better for her because Paul is going to finish college get a good job and pay for Rose and Anna to go to college as well.
That she's very busy and always doin something. Like she has to work, but also has a state contest for an essay she really wants to win to go to Sacromento. But then she is on the verge of getting fired because she is taking to many days off for the essay and to watch her little sister. Her mom works late and she misses her dad for being gone for  4 months for work. She just feels exhuasted and cant do anything.
One trait i can tell that Anna has is determination. she said, 'Even if i win, I won't get to travel to Sacramento to receive the prize.' She still has to work or her supervisor is going to fire her.
She was a very busy person, and if she won she could not go to Sacramento.
She worrys a lot about the future and her family.  She says in her converstaion with Anna; Anna says 'money isn't everything.' Rose says 'only if you already have everything,'
she says her aunt might tell her mom and if she does she'll hurt her.
Well one trait that I cans ee is that she believes that she always takes things the negative way.. Her glass is always half empty.
Rose is some that represses her emotions, and it shows when she is talking to Anna about the money issues. Rose believes that everything will be better because of her dad working in Los Angeles. She tries to hide her emotions, and also hide what she feels by making it seem like everything is going to be okay, when she knows there is a possibilty that it won't.
Rose seems like she respects her elders, and listens to what the have to say. In the story; Rose listend to what Aunt Kolab interperetted about her dream.
Rose is a very selfless character. She gives up so much time of her own in order to help her family, specifically her brother, and she can only hope that in the long run it will pay off. In her conversating with Aunt Kolab, her selflessness becomes evident when Rose struggles to reveal how pressured she feels all the time because she does not want to let her family down.
Rose is the type of person that knows her purpose and that her actions are for a reason.  In paragraph 11, she tells Anna that, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.  Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'  Rose shows that she has faith in Paul and faith that working hard will pay off in the end.
She doesn't like to talk about her feelings, its shown in how she fake laughs at herself while talking to Anna.
Rose is a caring person. She tries to help Anna realize that what is happening in the family will turn out to be a good thing. The event of their dad moving away was for him to get more money. Their brother, Paul, is going to college to get a good job so he will be able to pay for his sisters to go to college. Rose is trying to be optimistic about the situation even though she does not feel it. This is what she tries to portray to Anna.
She works way too much to where shes falling asleep doing her work. ' I fell asleep working on my essay,' Rose said.
Rose is very strong and tries to show her sister that there is nothing to worry about even when Rose her self is as little worried. 'She tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her.'
Rose is a shy person when it comes to describing her feelings to others. A detail that supports this is when Aunt Kolab asked her if she felt weighed down by what she is doing to help the family Rose didnt answer her, she just nodded her head.
One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversation with Aunt Kolab is that she is nice. One detail from the story that supports my answer is she didn't answer Aunt Kolab question.
'only if you already had everthing...' Rose has already discovered that lifr IS in fact about money, without it there is barley any survival.
Rose is a caring person; she wants everyone else to be happy even if it puts more stress on her. In paragraph 19 Rose thinks to herself that she can not tell the truth, and say the way she really feels because it will upset her aunt and her mother. She did not want to desappoint them but she was too stressed to work all the time.
Rose is a very responsible girl. She helps take care of her family. She poured her sister some juice, even though she didn't have to. And she's been helping take care of the family since her father moved to get a new job, and her mother was no working.
Rose is an extremely brave and responsible individual. Already in her teen years she is seen working and being so helpful to her familys' financial state. She is often portrayed as having her familys' best interest in mind throughout her life, no matter what she does. And is very gentle and kind as she explains to her younger sister, Anna, why things are so hard. She tells Anna why she can't see her Papa as often as prefered, because he is working in California for the better of the family.
One trait that describes Rose is caring. When her sister came into the kitchen, Rose asked what was wrong. 'Anna,' Rose said. 'What's rong? You feel okay?'
Rose is someone that looks out for others and cares more about the good of the group rather than her personal situation.  She likes to put herself in other's shoes to understand what they are going through and how she can help.  Her aunt sees this same quality in her when she states, 'But now I realize that you're seeing the situation through other eyes-as you should, I suppose, because you grew up here...'
You can tell from the story that Rose is a considerate person. You can understand this from her converstation with Anna. She fakes a laugh, and pretends everything is okay, even when it is not. She tries to make sure her sister is okay in paragraph 5. 'What's wrong? You feel okay?'
In the story, Rose is hopeful. In Paragraph 11, she stated that her brother Paul will finish college, in addition, he will get a good job, and then pay for the two sisters college education.
Rose is optimistic about situations.Her sister Anna thinks it's been a long time since she's seen her Papa but Rose tries to make it seem like it wasn't a long time by saying 'It's only been four months.'
One trait that could describe Rose is that she is trying very hard to support her family and still be able to succeed in her personal goals. In the story, the writer states, 'From school she's gone straight to the restaurant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After that is was time to do homework.' One can see that Rose's life is very busy.
QUIET AND HARD HEADED
If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. Rose doesn't want to hurt her family becasue she is caring.
Rose asks her younger sister, Anna, what's wrong and if she is feeling okay. This shows that Rose is a loving person and respects others. She loves her sister very much and you can see that by what questions she asked Anna.

Rose is tired of her family. She always has to work and never gets any time to herself. but her aunt is trying to make it better Rose gives suggestions as ' Hmm. Maybe we can find a way to do things differently. Away better for you'
Rose is a caring person. When Rose and Anna were talking, Rose asked her what was wrong which showed that she cares about how her sister feels. Also she cares about her family because she doesn't want to let them down with writing her essay.
Rose seems to be a negative person based on the way she avoids anything truly positive in her conversation with Anna.
anna is hard working and so is aunt kolab.

Rose is optimistic about her future in life. 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
Rose's conversations between Anna and her herself show how independent she is. When talking to her younger sister, she acts like her mother and watches over Anna. Instead of ignoring her sister like some older siblings may do, Rose asks Anna what is the matter and checks to see if she's alright. As Anna continues to worry, Rose tries to reassure her that things will be fine in the future as long as they work together. Rose assumes the responsibility in the absence of her mother and doesn't rely on anyone to do work for her.
Rose  felt  an  urgent  need  to  relatd  the dream,  to  expose  it  so  it  would  loosen  its  grip  on  her.

She is not a very happy person, even though she tries to come across to others as being hopeful and joyous.Rose kept nodding. Maybe her life get easier. Maybe it wouldn't.
Rose does not want to her family to assume that she is lazy or that she feels overworked by helping her family because she cares for her family and feels guilty in a way by feeling overly busy.  An example of this is when she says, ''Do you feel so weighed down by what you;re doing to help this family?' Rose didn't answer.  If she otld the truth, she would hurt her aunt.  And probably her aunt would tell her mother'.
Rose is very responsible, as her telling Anna about their duty helping Paul finish college shows.
Rose is very strong, she had to show no emotion with little sister, Anna. Anna was angry that her father has been away for so long. But Rose is explaining to Anna that he needs to make money to  keep Paul in school. Rose misses her dad too, and wishes they didn't have to work so hard to make money, but she has to be strong for her sister.
She tried A Laugh That Sounded Fake Even To Her.
Anna rolled her eyes and shoved her chair away from the table.
Rose is a lonely person, 'Rose had glanced at her parents' faces. Four eyes shining with tears'.
Even though she's as stressed as she is, she still cares about others. It seems like she is used to putting others before herself.
One trait that can describe Rose is caring. Rose is caring because she works hard to earn money for her struggling family so they can pay for Paul, Rose's brother, to finish college.
She doesn't like hurting other peoples feelings especially her familys. Rose didn't answer. if she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.
That Anna is her little sister and that they hate when they mother is always working late.
Rose is overwhelmed, you get this idea because whenever you look at the things Rose says you can imagine the feelings that are going through her. One of the examples would be the essay- Rose is overwhelmed with her busy life that she's barley having enough time to just write an essay for the contest.
One trait that best describes Rose is responsiable. Rose show a great deal of responsablity because she is dealing with a lot to help support her family at such a young age and when he little sister begins to feel tired of the situation, as does Rose. Rose explains to Anna, without grief, that what they are doing is the best for the family. 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.' Rose said to Anna. She explained that in the long run, and the troubles have settled, that it will benefit them.
Rose has sympathy for people. She does not want to hurt others feelings. In the story it says that if Rose told the truth than it might hurt her aunts feelings.
In Roses' conversation with Anna it was clear Rose is very supportive of her family. Rose work's a part time job that takes up most of her time trying to make enough money to help her brother attend high school. This shows that Rose is very responsible and knows that she is doing what she must to help her brother with his future.
One trait that describes Rose is caring. In her conversation with Anna, she not only asks if she is okay, but speaks gently to her in order to try to ease her pain.
one of Rose's traits in the story is being insercure about herself.
SHE IS JUST LIKE HER MOTHER.
One trait that can describe Rose is she is a  understandying person and takes advice from her elders very well. An example from the article is; (last paragraph) Rose kept nodding. Maybe her life would get easier.Maybe it wouldn't. But her aunt's offer had somehow made her feel lighter. (line 21) Rose nodded.
On trait that describe Rose is that she has alot on her mind like resposiblities when she is having converstions with her aunt and sister she often thinks about other things.
i believe rose is forgiving and it shows she is when her and anna are talking and rose said, 'the job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here'.
Rose cares for others feelings in the 19th paragraph rose didn't want to teel the truth to her aunt because it would hurt her feelings.
her sister walks in and she ignors the eassy and tends to her sister'anna,' 'what's wrong?you feel okay?'
I think that Rose can be described as caring but once it gets to a certain point she just starts to care about herself.
When Anna walks in from her bad dream, Rose is nice to her but than when they get to talking about her mom not being at home and working they start to argue a little.  Like when Rose said, 'He had to go. The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here.' Anna said, 'Money isn't everything.'
Rose is busy.  Rose is always doing something, wheather it is writting an essay, dreaming, taking care of her sister, or talking to her aunt.
It is evident that Rose is stressed based on her conversation with Aunt Kolab, who simply nodded instead of showing a positive attitude when Kolab told her of how normal her feelings are and her hopes.
One trait that identifies Rose is that she likes to make other people happy. With her siste, Anna, she hid how she was feeling weighed down and tried to make her sister feel better. With her Aunt Kolab, she didn't want to tell her the truth because it would hurt her and her mother.
Rose realized she was a stronge person and could get through anything.
Rose is the type of person that is curious, someone that gets to the bottom of things.'Rose felt an urgent need to relaye the dream, to expose it so it would loosen its grip on her.'
One trait that can describe Rose would be concern. The morning when her and Anna talked about their dad being gone and all the problems within the family, Rose asked Anna if she was okay and Rose tried to talk to Anna and make her feel better and try to get Anna to believe everything that was happening was happening for a good reason/cause.
One trait is that she is really upset. as stated from the text 'four eyes shining with tears'
She's helpful. She doesn't quite like all the work she must do but she continues to help and tries not to complain even though her Aunt Kolab can tell how Rose feels by listening to her dream. She didn't ask for a relief of her helping efforts but she did appreciate it but is still willing to help if she is needed to.
Rose is a very kind hearted person, I can tell this because she listens and talks to people when they need someone to talk to.
Rose akways looks on the bright side of things.she knows she can do anything.
FRIGHTENED, ROSE WOKE GASPING FOR AIR
She is caring of her family by trying to make Anna feel better about their situation.
Rose demonstrates a very hopeful attitude in her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab. When Anna complains about never seening her parents, Rose responds by explaining how their jobs and the family's current situation will eventually work out for the better.
Rose is carimg. I think she is this way because when she is Aunt Kolab she doesn't complain on how she feels about working to help pay her brother through college and how her mom is never home and how she isn't getting her school work done very well because she is tired. She just moves through the day because she has to do this because its her family and she would do anything for them.
Rose is somewhat selfish compared to the rest of her family.  They had had to brave coming to America from Cambodia.  Rose had no idea what Cambodia was like and how bad it was there.
Rose doesn't beleive in Paul.
Rose is a postive and mature influence on her sister, Anna's life.  Anna feels discouraged and resentful towards how hard she and her family must work to put her older brother Paul through college.  Rose reasures her that once Paul is through college he will pay for them to go to college. Rose selflessly suppresses her stress and anger for the sake of her sister.
rose is very busy with her life and doesnt think that she has time to appreciate or have time to do other stuff she really wants to do
She is caring because she mentions how hard she is working to help out her family.
Rose is compassionate because even though she is exhausted and trying to work while going to school she still tries to calm her sister. She tried to make Anna feel better about her father being away.
That they are like each other.  They talk like each other.
Based on her conversation with Anna, one can deduce that a defining characteristic of Rose is her selflessness. It is evident that she wants nothing more than to help her brother to finish college. She is understanding of the family's position and is doing everything in her power to improve it.
She seems uncaring and ignores what her sister Anna or how she is feeling. For example, when Anna says 'I had a bad dream,' Rose continues on with her problems and never asks  about the dream.
Exhausted, 'I feel asleep working on my essay,' Rose said.
She tries to find a away to suppres her feelings
Anna cares for and wants to know if there is anything wrong with anyone, Anna is not greegy but likes to share with others.
Rose is sympthatic person towards Anna.  When Anna came in to the kitchen at the start of the story Rose asked, 'Whats wrong.'  Anna said, 'I'm fine, I just had another bad dream.'  Rose replied, trying to be funny and sympthatic at the same time, 'I fell asleep working on my essay.' She gets up and goes pour her sister a class of orange juice.
One trrait that Rose has is she's self-centered.  She's self-centered because in a conversation with Anna she hinted her that money is every and in a conversation with Aunt Kolab she wanted her to go to work to make more money.
Anna's trait is that she is truthful. She told her sister what she had to do which was get over dad being gone and help Paul get through college.
Rose has a maternal trait.  This has been shown through her conversation with her sister Anna.  For example when she speaks to Anna the author says she uses a gentle voice.
She is very angry for some reason
NOSYASK TO MANY QUESTIOPNS
When Rose was talking to her Aunt Kolab. I think that Rose is just being selfish and just doesn't want to help out with anything. She's basically only thinking about herself. 'Maybe I can sew for the ladies or make special treats and sell them'. Her aunts offer made her feel lighter.
I think that she is faithful, becuase in both conversations she wants to do something to help. In the conversation with anna she wants life to be easier so that they can go to college. Also in the conversation with her aunt she wants to do something to help people see some thing from their country of Cambodia. Things like sewing some things for women from there or make special treats.
She is very devoted to her school work, she won't give up. In the story when Rose is talking to Anna she talks about her essay, then when she talks to Aunt Kolab she talks about her topic for her essay.
That Rose and her aunt both know how Rose feels in their family situation.Rose's aunt asks her 'Do you really feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'
One trait is that Rose is a caring person, that loves and respects her aunt. During her conversation with Aunt Kolab, Rose did not expose her dream to her aunt because she did not want to hurt her's or her mother's feelings.
I think Rose felt frustrated or weighed down on by her family. Aunt Kolab mentioned to Rose that her parents and Aunt Kolab went through similar situations in Cambodia.
Based on her conversation with Anna, the reader can conclude that Rose is a strong person. For the sake of her younger sister, she puts on a brave attitude and sincerely assures her sister that all the promblems and conflicts within the family will soon be ressolved. We know that Rose works very hard in everything that she does, mainly for the sake of her family.       In the begining of the story, we read that Rose feels very worried that she won't be able to finish an essay for class, do to the fact that her life is too busy work and and taking care of the family. However, when she is having her conversation with Anna, Rose takes time out of working on her essay and pours two glasses of orange juice for both herself and her sister. This suprised me a lot because of how much she stressed on her essay in the begining of the story. I believe that this little action shows that Rose is a strong and hearfelt person.
She is very wise like in the conversation with Anna as she said that they needed to get their parts so thier brother, Paul, can pay for their colleges.
' Do you feel so wighed down by what you're doing to help  this family?' Rose feels too much pressure on herself. She has bad dreams
Rose is a friendly person. She does not get mad or upset with Anna when she came into her room.
Rose is a very worrisome person. She worries about what her future holds for Anna and herself. She feels that the weight of the family is coming down on her and can't help but to be bothered by the situation that she is in. She feels the her brother will not be able to pull throw and will hurt her and her sisters futures of going to college just as he did. My supporting detail is as she lies in the dark she cups her hands and say's 'Paul's fate lies partly in these.'
Rose is conflicted. She feels like she has too much responsibilty in helping the family, yet feels like she must help.
Caring Rose says 'We have to help paul finish college so he can get a good job.'
One trait that describes Rose is the way she supresses her true feelings.  She knows that Paul getting a good job and paying for both herself and Anna to go to college is basically impossible, but she wants to believe it's true so she doesn't have to worry so much.  One detail to support this would be the when Rose cupped her hands and though about how hard it must be for Paul to have all of that pressure on his shoulders.
Rose is strong. In her conversation with Aunt Kolab, she is careful because she doesn't want to reveal to her aunt that she is exhausted from working and going to school. Rose fears that tis may dissapoint her aunt and her mother. She feels weighed down from all of her responsibilites and doesn't think that all of this is necessary. But she does this with a good heart.
Rose is dedicated, but feels pinned down. Shes wishes for alone time and free time, but knows she has the duty of helping her family. You know this because she has a part time job and because of what she says to her little sister. 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay foe you and me to go to college.' This shows that she feels pressured to help so that she can be helped in return.
Rose has a tendency to not let others know how she is really feeling. An example of this is in paragraph 11, sentence 2 when 'she tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her.' This shows that Rose is hiding her true emotions so that she can make Anna feel better about their family situation. Instead of voicing her doubts, she laughs in an attempt to brighten the situation.
she is talkative
Rosa was kind to Aunt Kolab when she didn't answer the question.  She didn't want to hurt her aunt.
She believes what she wants to believe. According to the passage, the quote 'we have our part to do to help Paul finish college' and then he'll help pay for you and me to go to college. Rose believes this because if she helps Paul finish school then she is putting her foot through the door.
She's a very busy girl and tries to get tasks done. She goes to school then goes straight to the restaurant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help her aunt prepare a quick supper. After that she does homework.
One trait about Rose that is gotten from this story is that she cares about her family and loves them. During her conversation with Anna she is constantly trying to make Anna understand what's going on so Anna isn't so angry at everyone in the family. During her conversation with her aunt she is able to explain everything to her aunt, and because her aunt understands she givers her ideas for better jobs that wont weigh so much on Rose. Through these ideas Rose realizes how important family is.
'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.'      This statement shows that Rose feels like she is under a lot of pressure but doesn't want to say anything because she will feel guilty for not helping. Aunt Kolab realizes this and tried to help by saying that things were done differently where they grew up in comparison to Rose. This helps Rose a lot because now she knows that someone is there to help because Rose is too young to have to be worrying about helping get money and should be worried about school.
I believe that rose feels tired, but she still wants to help her family. In the story her aunt asked ' Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' I believe she does feel weighed down, but she is a hard worker and that is her trait I am speaking of.
Rose is just do down and depressed with her whole life. The way that she talks and the way that she tells t he events that are going on in the story.
Rose is  careing person. She firsts askes her sister is she was okay. then Rose states that she and Anna play a big role in helping Paul finish college.
Rose is very considerate. She did not want to Aunt Kolab her real feelings on the situation because she was afraid it was going to hurt her. Instead, she decided to take in all the responibilites given to her and do the best with them and that concluded to Rose possibly having a change in her life.
Rose is very considerate to the feelings of others.  When speaking to Rose, she does not tell her that she also feels hopeless about their situation.  She speaks about Paul and how he will eventually come back to help them.
she is very imaginary. the walls of her room were bathed in pale sunlight.
Rose is a hard working girl, who is trying to support her family now because her father is away for right now. She goes from schoolto work then aunts then she has to try and get her homework done all in that days time.
Rose always thinks about her family. Rose said to her aunt, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you are doing to this family?'
One Trait that would describe Rose would be helpful. Rose is help ful because she help around the house and help Paul finish college. In the text it says 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
Rose is a good listiner, when she is talking to her Auant Kolab she dosnt say anything and just nods in consideration.
Rose is very optimistic when it comes to a conversation/arguement with her sister because she put in all kinds of examles that could be put as relieving or helpful.
One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab is maturity. Rose is very mature for her age. Rose gets out of school, goes strait to work for a four hour shift, comes home to help her Aunt with dinner, and then tries to find time to complete all of her homework. Rose does all of these things and is always busy because she wants to help out her family who came to america from Cambodia. Rose also shows her maturity in her conversation with Anna, although Anna says she misses her dad and that money isn't everything while Rose says that they need the money, and they are just doing what is neccisary to support the family and put both of the girls in college.
One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab is responsiblity. An example from the story is when Anna comes into the kitchen and complains about her and Rose's parents being gone so much and Rose explains to Anna that their parents need to be where they are to help give their brother schooling which will in turn give them an opportunity at schooling. It is also revealed that Anna sees Rose as responsible when she says 'You sound just like Mama', who is a mature and given to seem as a responsible person.
Rose cares about other people because she doesnt want to hurt her Aunt Kolab when she asked 'Do you feel so wieghed down by what you're doing to help this family?' (sentence number 12)
Rose i think is like basically any other child , i mean she didnt want to make her aunt feel bad so she didnt actually claim a lie. She seems sad and depressed , cause if her dad not being home and all  the work she has to do . I mean thats hard on a teen , and depressing.
Strong. This is purely in the mentally and emotional sense since there is no evidence given for physical. She is strong because she does not give up no matter how hard it is. She works, goes and most likely excells at school because she is involved with the competition, and also helps support her family.
Rose is very respectful and thinks before she speaks. In the story Rose kept nodding to Aunt Kolab. She did not want to answer Aunt Kolab because if she told the truth, she might hurt her aunt, and her aunt would tell her mom. Instead of saying anything, she just nodded and her aunt already understood.
One trait that can describe Rose is that she has a strong duty and respect for her family. One can see this when she says, ''We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.''
She dont pay attention too anna, and anna dont pay attention too her.
Rose has faith. At the beginning of the story she was almost stressed at the fact that she had to write an essay and hadn't started yet, but then by the end of the story she realized that her family and the way they were doing things is to help each other. Then since she never gave up on the essay all of a sudden the idea came to her of her essay topic.
She feels very stressed about the burden she has on her. She has a job, a three-thousand word essay to do, and a little sister to worry about.
One of the main characteristics that appears in the story is burdened. When she is dreaming of her brother like a stone on top of her in the water, it displays the pressure and the burden that she is plagued with.
Rose is a caring person. One reason she is caring is because in line 19, she didn't want to hurt her family by telling them the truth. The truth was that Rose did feel weighed down by having to help provide for the family.
That Rose see it as she the olny one that matter and don't see it from another person point of view. Rose see it as family is way more important than anything. One thing about her is she get angry to fast and don't sit down and think about things.
A triat of Rose's is that she is a queit person.  In both conversations Rose didn't say much.  In the conversation with her Aunt Kolab, Rose kept nodding, rather than speaking.  This trait has a likely cause and can be related to the situation, showing that the trait can be proven to be true; Rose is has a very stressful and abnormal life at home with her family.
One trait that i thinks descibes rose would be hardworking. She goes to school and then straight tp her job and then has to worry about typing a huge essay.
Rose optimistic person. When Anna says 'money isn't everything,' Rose responds with 'only if you already ahve everything.'
she is very responsible by trying to help paul finish college, and shes doing everything she can to help her family.
They are try to see if Rose is having too much work for her to handly by herself. Since she have school to do to, the restaurant for a four-hour shift, then help out with the family.
Rose is caring. She cares about her family, even though it is not her resopnsibility to do so. She also worries about her brother and sister and wants what is best for herself and her family.
Rose is doing everythimg she can to help her family, because she knows its what her family is expecting of her. She supresses how she feels, because she doesn't want to sound ungrateful, nor does she want to make her family upset.  She hesitates about telling Aunt Kolab that she does feel weighed down by all the heavy responsibility being given to her, because she doesn't want to hurt her aunt, or have her aunt tell her mother. She speaks grimly to herself when she wakes up, almost discouraging herself from doing the essay she has to, but she doesn't agree w/her sister, because she feels it wouldn't be fair and her sister wouldn't understand her.  She is a very honorable, responsible, and helpful daughter, but she needs to learn to stand up for herself before she has so much responsibility that she can't take it all.
Rose is hopeful. When she talked to her Aunt Kolab, it had said 'Maybe her life would get easier.' When they had that talk Rose saw eye to eye with her aunt, and no matter how bad things had been, she had hoped for better days.
Rose has a helpless attitude. In the story, her little sister says 'money isn't everything.' Rose responds to that by saying 'only if you already have everything.' This shows that Rose has, in a way, given up.
She seems like an optimist because she doesn't get angry about her dad like Anna does.
Rose is stressed. Aunt Kolab can see that Rose feels weighed down by what she is doing to help her family.
Rose could be considered protective towards her family. When her little sister Anna says, 'I'm so lonesome for Papa. It seems like he's been gone for years', Rose attempts to consul her sister by saying, ' It's only been four months... He had to go. The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here'. Also, Rose is working extremely hard in school and at work to help support her family a sure sign of a desire to protect and help her family.
Rose is a girl who seemed to always be stressed out. She freaks out an Anna which kinda gives it away.
Rose is a very responsible girl. She just wants what is best for her family; you can tell my the conversation she had with her little sister Anna. Although they are going through rough times Rose understands that her father is doing the right thing for the situation, and she is greatful that he will pay for their college. Although she isn't happy that her father isn't around she is very mature in the sense that she can see her fathers good intentions.
One trait that can decribe Rose is caring. She cares so much about her brother and wants him to graduate from college and will do anything to help him do so.
A trait I can identify from Rose's conversations is that she cares about people in her famil.  For example in paragraph nineteen it say's Rose didn't answer.  If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.
doesnt want to hurt anybody;  'if she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. and probably her aunt would tell her mother'
She's caring, because she doesn't want to hurt her Aunts feelings by telling her that she did feel weighted down by what she's doing to help the family.
Rose is very mature.  She helps support her family and tries to do her best at what she can.  Including her school and job.      She shows this matuirity in the conversatin between her sister where her sister describes her as being like their mother.     'You sound just like Mama.'
One trait is that she is busy all the time but yet she is a hard worker.One detial that supports my answer is that she can barely squeeze in a three-thousand word essay.
Rose ithinks money is everything and that she needs to have it. A detail from the passage is when she says 'The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here.'
Rose is hard working and a very respectful girl,the story states, 'if she told the truth,she would hurt her aunt.And her aubt would probably tell her mother.'
She's a caring person because she asks her little sister how she is feeling and whats wrong.
She is very kind. In both situations she never raises her voice and tries to tell her point of view without making any one mad.
One trait to describe Rose is that she is caring. On top of her three-thousand word essay she has to finish, she still makes time for her sister. She gives her sister some supporting words. Also, she is worried about her brother and parents.
Rose cares about her aunt because in paragraph 23 he aunt is telling her how she can make things different and Rose says 'Maybe her life would get easier' as a sing that she cares about her.
stressed out because she has to help out her family and do her school work.
Rose is a hard worker and always is pushing herself to the limit. This is proved by her taking on the tasks of helping her aunt as well as the essay. Even though she is busy, she tries to make time for all that is necessary.
Hard working. From school she'd gone straight to the restraunt to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After that it was time to do homework.
Rose is helpful, because she helps her aunt make dinner.
Based on her conversation with her sister Anna, Rose seems to be quite understanding. When Anna complains to Rose about their father being away Rose takes the time to explain to Anna why it is their father is in that situation. Instead of instantly reverting back to her own interests Rose makes the effort to consider everyone else and absorb the whole situation before talking about it to her sister.
Anna is understanding in what is going on with in  her family and how she plays a part in working through the situation.
In this story an example used to describe what kind of person rose is would be: 'we have our part to do to help paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job , Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'(paragraph 11, line 3&4)Reading this and the part of Rose talking about her job and school and home life makes me think Rose is a person that wants to succeed.
She said that she just wonted to be like a fish and beeenin the water all the time. When she was talking to to her Aunt she told her she was just misssing her home country of Combodian.
durring Rose's conversation with Anna she sounds like she feels that she has to understand that her pappa has to be away from home and that she has to look after Anna and help her family.
Rose try's to be thoughtful of her sister and aunt, but she has the essay that she has been working on. she goes on to say that if she wins we wont get to travel to Sacramento to reive the prize she wants.
I would say a good trait to describe Rose would be that she is very caring. An example from the passage would be when Rose professes that 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.' I beleive this quote shows Rose's willingness to sacrifice part of her own happiness to help her brother to gain his own happiness in life. Only a truly caring person would make such a sacrifice in their life.
One trait that describes Rose, based on her conversation with Aunt Kolab is caring.In paragraph 19, Rose supresses her feelings so that she wouldn't hurt her aunt. This is just one example of how Rose is a kind and caring person.
That she is stressed out on helpping pay for pauls college funds while shes in school doing work.she fell asleep, and had a nightmare of paul drowning her with the weight he has bringing
One trait that can describe Rose is respectful. She did not tell her aunt the truth about how she felt because Rose did not want to hurt her aunt.
Based on the two conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab, you can tell Rose just wants to get rid of a lot of stress in her life. most of the stress is caused by her parents, but her brother is also a contributing stress factor.
Rose is very understanding. We see an example of this in the story during the conversation she had with Anna. She understood that Papa had to work to put Paul through college, while Ana did not seem to be so understanding.
Rose seems to be very stressed and has had a lot of responsibility put on her. After telling Aunt Kolab about her dream, her aunt looked at her and asked, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'
Rose is understanding about everything. 'We have our part to do to help Paul finsh college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
Rose is a dedicated person with a kind heart which is obvious to see as she tries to justify her parents actions to Anna and won't risk answering how she truly feels to Aunt Kolab for fear of hurting her. Rose is more concerned with the well-being and feelings of others than her own, and it seems plain as day as you read this story.
She seems like she is overwhelmed. She has to do this essay for a state competition ('When would she sqeeze in writing a flawless three-thousand-word essay?'), help her sister calm down to go back to sleep('I just had another bad dream, Anna says. Rose talks to her until she exits to bed.), she has a job that she is struggling to keep('...and her supervisor was on the verge of firing her.'), a family to help take care of('...straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper.'), and a lot of expectations to do as her brother did.('She felt too young for so much responsibility...imagining how her brother must feel.')
In the story Rose is a very mature girl.  She realizes the pressure that is on her to make her family succeed.  It shows how mature she is in the story when she explains to her sister the importance of Papa being in Los Angeles.  Rose helps explain things to her younger sister leading her younger sister to say she sounds just like Mama.
She is simalar to her mother.'Anna rolled her eyes and shoved her chair away from the table. 'You sound just like Mama.''
One characteristic that we see of Rose is her sense of realism. When Rose is talking to Anna, she talks to her about helping Paul finish college, toward which Anna feels resentment. Rose talks about money and other worldly things that trouble her.
Rose is very busy and has to much on her hands and she doesn't get enough sleep. Rose goes to school than she goes to work and works a four-hour shift than goes home and cooks dinner for her sister and aunt and has to still finsih her homework.
One of Rose's traits include being always busy.  She always has something that she needs to do.
Rose is very lonely and she feels very sad. Like when she had a convorsation with her aunt she wanted to try something new to make her happier.
I would have to say that rose is a hard work because it said she worked a four hour shift after school then came home to help with dinner nd then had to work on her essay.
Based on Rose's conversation with Anna, you can tell that she cares for her younger sister and the rest of her family. She tries to comfort her sister by gently saying, 'It's only been four months,' when her sister talks about how it seems so long that her father has been gone.
That she is real open but hessitent to to say what she really wants to, because she doesn't want to hurt aunt if she tells the truth.
The one trait I would use to described Rose would be helpful. I believe Rose is helpful because she not only goes to school but she helps support her family. In the story it said that Rose's brain must have surrendered to exhaustion, and it goes on to explain why. Rose had a paper to write but she fell asleep because of the school day she had earlier and the four-hour shift she had worked at the restraunt prior to her coming home.
Rose is a type of person that think s about her furture. She can just picture her brother getting he diloma and makeing her parents pround of him. Knowing that their lives rest in what her brother dose, it makes her think about a lot of stuff.
A trait Rose has is believing. In the passage she is worried at first about her family and isn't sure if things will get better because her mom's never home and her dad doesn't live with them because he got a better job in Los Angeles that pays three times more than his old job when he lived with them. After Rose had a talk with her Aunt Kolab she started believing that she can help make things better and she would do her best to make that happen.
She is really caring and sincere. When talking to her aunt she tried to hold in her feelings about her responsibility in the family so she wouldnt offend her aunt or hurt her feelings.
One trait that Rose possesses is being compasionate towards others.  An example of this is when she is talking with Anna and says, 'Anna, What's wrong?  You feel okay?'
Rose is worried about if she will be able to go to college or not, because it all rests on her brother's shoulders. In the story she talks about paul finishing college and getting a good job to pay for them to go to college.
I believe she could be seen as a patient person. Because in both conversations she listens to anna and her aunt, and then gives her opinion on the issue at hand.
When Rose was talking to her Aunt Kolab it showed that she was hard working. That she was tired of all the things she had to do for her family.
Rose was aften discouraged and did not feel positive towards many things, and hurt her loved ones at times.
Rose exemplifies the trait of self doubt. Rose constantly ponders the idea of her life becomming easier but never truly beleives herself. When talking to Aunt Kolab, the author states; ' Rose kept nodding. Maybe her life would get easier.' Rose is showing self doubt in this situation by not thinking her life cause become easier and instead thinking her life may become easier.
In the conversation with Anna, Rose shows that she is encouraging and an optomist. She tries to help her sister understand the situation as kindly as possible.  Rose even tries to lighten the situation between Anna and her.  'She tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her.'  This shows that she knows the seriousness of the situation, yet wants to make her sister happier.
Rose never loses hope.  She always, no matter what situation she is going through, is hopeful.  She knows if she pays her dues now and helps get Paul through college, then he will return the favor.
Rose is considerate. She works hard on her school work, and she does her best at her job so she can help her family even at her young age. When Rose is talking to Aunt Kolab she refrains from telling her aunt how she really feels because she doesn't want to hurt her or her family. In paragraph 19, 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.' She is considerate of her family's feelings and their situation.
assuring, 'We have our part to do to help paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and hel'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
Rose seems to be the kind of person that, although she knows and feels that she has way to much on her plate, she doesnt show it in a time like when she was talking to Anna. When it would be most important that she kept her cool and assured anna that it was going to be alright.
THhey all have regrets in life about one important thing.
Rose is hopeful.As Rose is listening to Aunt Kolab offering to help, she realizes that her life might get easier, and that a sense of family could surivive through anything.
The conversation between Anna and Rose makes Rose seem like she is hopeful. Rose is stressed right now from having a job, helping her aunt cook, and going to school but in the end she knows her brother will help out when it is her turn. A detail from the story is when Rose tells Anna that Paul will get a good job and he will pay for the both of them when they go to college. Rose knows family is important and she does not give up no matter what the scenario is. This story is an excellent example of being there for your family when they need you.
Rose is able to be helped.     'But her aunt's offer had somehow made her feel lighter.'
Rose feels overwhelmed with the burden of responsibility that her family has placed on her. Her dream of Paul's body weighing her down underwater exemplifies this.
Rose is very gentle. She is very gentle because when her sister Anna was talking about how she hated that her father had to go to Los Angeles to work, Rose was trying to talk to her and tell her that the job pays more, and that it is important, and that he was helping them for their futures.
Rosa seems to be a hard-working young woman. Despite how weighed down she felt, she was willing to do whatever she could to support her family. She even got a job and went to school and was struggling to write a very long essay. She said to Anna that they had their part to do to help their brother finish college.
Rose wants to be the big person. She wants to preted to be happy and optimistic but she really doesn't on the inside. This is brought out especially during her dialougue with Aunt Kolab. She doesn't want to tell Aunt Kolab the real situation because she is afraid that she will tell her mother.This is apparent in paragragh 19 when she thought,      'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably        her aunt would tell her mother.'
she go to the high school
Rose is responsible within her family. She cares about her sister Anna when Anna feels disheartened. Also, Rose feels that she needs to help out her family and do all she can to help, even when it is difficult.
Rose seems very selfish when she was talking to Anna and she talkes about money and when Paul finishes college he will get a good job and pay for Anna and hers'. Anna makes a point that money is not everything. It seems like to Rose that it is.
Rose can be described as a hard worker. I think this because of the only line in paragraph seven, 'I fell asleep working on my essay,' Rose said.
When her sister walked in the room and Rose sead. what's worng? You feel okay?
She is very determined. During her conversation with Anna she says, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.' For a teen, working very hard to put someone else through college is an act that would take a lot of determinition.
Rose is young, but she is also very responsible working to make some extra money for her family even though she doesnt get to do some of the things she would like to.
cares about family, Rose goes from school straight to work a four hour shift before she comes home to so her homework so that she can help support her family.
She isn't self centered. She realizes how other people sees her situation.'But now I realize that you're seeing the situation through other eyes-as you should, I suppose, because you grew up here.... This must be difficult for you. Yes?'Rose nodded.
Rose is caring as you can tell from both of the conversations she had in the story. In neither of the conversations does she want to hurt the other ones feelings so Rose hides her fellings to make sure the other is not hurt.
Rose is curious about her life and if it will ever get easier. A detail I can use to support this theory is that in Paragraph 23, Sentence 2, she worries about her life and the aunt giving her advice that life would get better.
That Rose is a thoughtful girl because she wouldn't tell her aunt something that would hurt her.
Rose has a trait of unselfishness. There is something that is bothering her but she hesitates to share it, in fear that it may hurt the people around her. This trait is evident in paragraph 19 (sentences 1 and 2).
Rose is an over all hard worker, she has a job she takes care of her sister and she has to go to school.
One trait of Rose's is that she is very caring. She asked if her sister was ok when Anna walked into the room rubbing her eyes.
Rose represents herself as a very strong-willed person. Despite the situation that she is in with a geographically distant father and a working mother, she is able to live a busy life. While working and going to school, she maintains the mental health to interact with her family and help them as well. Though she may feel overwhelmed, when Rose speaks to her Aunt Kolab, she quickly regains her positivity, and moves on. This ability to continue under the pressures of a busy life is associated with a strong-willed personality, possessed by Rose.
When she was talking to Anna they was sayin that they hate her work sceduile because it was so late. Then they start talking about there brother Paul, and Rose said somthing about him graduateing from college and that when he does and he gets a good job and saves up money then he will pay for them to go to college as well. Anna got mad at Rose and stormed off.
Rose doesn't care about much of anything else besides herself. In the story Rose just completely ignores her sister after she comes out and says she had a bad dream.
A trait I see in Rose is that she tries her best at trying to keep her life togther while keeping a job and doing a three thousand word essay. She is a very busy but dedicated person. She's a person that likes to take control over the situation but in the end she just seems to become stressed out.
One trait that we can see in Rose is that she doesn't like to hurt people.  This is supported when her aust asks 'Do you feel weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'  She did not answer because she did not want to tell the truth and hurt her aunt.
Rose speakes her mind and tells how she feels about things.
Rose is very upset with her family.  She works all the time for her brother and doesn't get anytime for herself to do school work or hang out with friends.  In paragraph 23 her aunt offers her something that somehow make her feel lighter.
One trait that can describe Rose is her loyalty to her family. In Roses's conversations with Aunt Kolab, Rose shows how much she cares for the family even though it is hard for her to go to school and work both at her job and her home. Rose's dream is an example of this loyalty; even though her brother was sinking, she didn't leave him until she couldn't go on any longer.
Rose is optimistic, even when everything seems to be very hard for everyone.  When she is talking to Anna, she laughs and tries to lighten up the situation and make it seem better, even when it is negatively affecting everyone in the family.
She has patience and lets the problems work out.
If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.
Rose is truthfull'Rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream, to expose it so it would loosen its grip on her. After she'd finished, her aunt said, with a puzzled look.' Do you feel so weighed down by what your doing to help this family?'
Rosa feels like she has far too much responsibility than she should. Her dream of being weighed down by Paul shows that she thinks that everybody else is free of responsibility, yet she is forced to handle responsibilties nobody else has.
Anna poured two glasses of orange juice and handed one to Rose.
The trait that Rose has is responsability. In her conversation with her sister Anna, Rose brings up money and how it is some of their responsability to help their brother, Paul, finish college.
Rose takes after her mother.
One trait that I think can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab is overworked because in the story Aunt Kolab asks Rose, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' I think that quote from the story shows that she is overworked.
A trait that describes Rose is that she is worried about how things are in her family's lives.  She worries about her father being so far from home just for a job.
The conversation they had about the family, Aunt Kolab asked Rose if she was feeling weighed down by what she was doing to help her family. She didn't answer, because she knew if she did Rose would have hurt her aunt and her aunt would probably go tell her mom.
I think she is caring. I believe this because when her little sister comes in all worried she pretty much tells her that everything will be okay.
She is not able to stay focused, 'I fell asleep working on my essay.'
Rose is full of perseverance.  She constantly tries to help her family in every way possible, even though she has a busy life.  She expresses how her family relies on her when she states, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.'
Rose is a bit selfish but a dreamer. When she talks to Aunt Kolab she finally startsto comprihend that lateron her life might get easy and that all along she was just looking for a topic for her book that would show her personality and life style.
Rose is willing to work for her family and do anything for them. For example after she got done talking to her Aunt Kolab she thought to herself, 'Maybe her life would get easier. Maybe it wouldn't.' This shows she is atleast giving it a shot. Also another point that shows that Rose will do anything for her family is when she was talking to her sister, Anna. Anna said, 'Money isn't everything.' Rose said, 'Only if you already have everything.' This shows that Rose is willing to sacrifice what she wants to do, in order to make her family's needs.
she feels like she is running out of time in her life and this essay is really putting her down
Rose is easyily discouraged.
Rose can be described as a responsible person because she feels the pressure to help out her family by having a job to pay for her brothers college.
The relationship between Anna and Aunt Kolab sems good because in the story they are able to talk out there problems with each other nd can also express how they are feeling.
One trait that describes Rose is responsible. A detail that supports this is her dedication to her job, schoolwork, and chores at home. Rose continues to work on all of these things despite how stressed and busy she has become.
She thought she would she could get a trip to Sacramento to receive a prize, and she had already missed a lot of shifts, and her supervisor was on the verge of firing her.
Rose tries to be gentle with her sister Anna.
Rose is somewhat of an independent when it comes to accomplishing her goals, and holds back on telling others of her problems and hindrences. She prefers too complete these tasks by herself, and has no desire to cause stress on the people around her. This is demonstrated in the sentence, 'Rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream, to expose it so it would loosen its grip on her.'
I beleive Rose is very caring and understanding 'It's only been four months,' Rose said as gently as she could.
Rose is optimistic, because she lets Anna believe that she knows that when Paul gets out of college, he will get a job that will put them both trhough college as well.
Rose feels stressed because she fells too young for so much responsibility.
rose has one trait that makes her want to get in and feel for the person like whan it says 'she felt and urgent need to relate to the dream'
Rose is a very busy person. She has so many things that she has to keep up with throughout the day with her mom working so late, and her dad not there. She reveals how busy she is when she talks about trying to work on an essay that she does not have time for. She tells her sister that she fell asleep working on her essay. It is obvious she is overwhelmed.
A trait that can desciribe Rose would be that she is very sincere. When she was having a conversation with Aunt Kolab, she didn't want to answer the quetion that her aunt asked, which was 'Do you feel weighted down by what you're doing to help this family', because Rose did feel weighted down. She did not want to hurt her aunts' feelings by telling her the truth.
Rose is feels stressed or wieghed down by having to support her family. She shows this when she tells her aunt about the dream she had.
One trait that Rose is hopeful. She tell Anna that their brother will get a job after college to pay for their college education.
She cares for her family. It show when she does not answer her aunt to keep from hurting her aunt's feelings.
I believe that one of the traits Rose displays is optimism. In paragraph 11 ( sentence 5 ) , Rose says,' Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.' This shows that she understands the severity of the situation, but chooses to keep her chin up, for her sister and herself.
Rose is hard-working, the story told how she went from school to her job and then home to work some more. She's constantly busy and doesn't complain much, a good trait to acquire.
One trait would be that Rose understanding.  She showed this during her conversation with Anna when Anna showed her frustration when Rose agreed with Mama.
She is a care person for not telling her aunt that she really is overwelmed by all the things she has to do. but insted is willing to go through them so anuther family member does not have to doo something else.
Rose is very respectful and conconcious about other's feelings. She didn't tell her aunt how she fell because she didn't want to hurt her feelings.
Rose feels guilty about feeling not wanting to have so much responsibilty in her family, but she is a very nice and sincere person because she didn't want to tell her aunt how she felt.
Rose is a very understanding character in the story because obviously she doesnt like all the work she has to do and how much is getting put on her all at once. However she knows that it is for the good of the family, she knows that by gathering the money needed for Paul to finish college and get a good job he will be able to pay for them to go to college. As she says ' We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he will get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.' So she knows he responsibility, she may not like it but she know that she has to do it.
Rose is proud.  She does not what her aunt to know how hard it was for her to do so much work.
optimism, when rose is talking to her aunt she says that her aunt's offer makes her feel lighter and she even says that her life might start getting easier.
Rose is always trying to be positive in the way she talks to people. The conversation with her sister proves this point because Rose is telling her about how everything will be alright, and that Paul will help us, her dad will be coming back, and her mom will be too.
Rose is very caring, she wants the best for her family and her little brother that is going to be putting her sister and her through college when he goes up. Until then, she is doing everything. She doesn't want to tell her aunt because she might tell her mother or hurt her aunt.
Rose is pessimistic, she looks at the upside on uncomfortable situations. When Ana described how she felt lonley for her father and how long it feels that hes been gone, Rose explains that what he is doing is helping the family. She also says that he is only been gone for four months, making the situation realistic.
She is sad due to all the events that have occured in her life recently. Im so lonesome for papa it seems as if he hasnt been home for years.
Rose can be described as caring and considerate of others' feelings.  In her conversation with Aunt Koleb, she hesitates to reveal her true feelings about the burden of helping Paul get through college because she does not want to offend her aunt.  This shows that she values others and puts them before her personal interests.
One characteristic that can adequately define Rose's personality would be hard-working. She is willing to devote what seems to be the vast majority of her free time towards helping out her family and setting them up for a more enjoyable future. The day that is described early in the story included zero downtime for her. She went from school, straight to her work, and then right back home to help her aunt. When she finished those tasks, she had to attempt to complete her homework assignment while fighting exhaustion.
One trait that describes Rose is that she's helpful. She likes to help all of her family members in this time of need when her family depends on her the most. Although she does get stressed out about it, she still fights through all of the stress she has.
She is taking on alot of responsibility in her house, for her family since her brother is not there anymore.
Rose is an overachiever. She's doing so much, in so little time. Working & school, doing the essay. Trying to go to college. She just feels overwhelmed.

The trait that can describe Rose is she likes to tell others where she came from her background and what she feels about things. She talked about where she was and what she disliked about stuff. She also is hiding something that is important.
One trait that Rose displays in her conversation with Aunt Kolab is that she is selfless. Even though Rose feels weighed down by her responsibilities, she does not complain to her Aunt Kolab because she knows that it would hurt her feelings. Roses' life is very difficult, but she puts the feelings of her aunt and her mother above her own feelings.
Rose feels responsible to help her brother. Rose says to Anna that 'we have our part to do to help Paul finish college.'
One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversation with Anna is that she is an overwhelmed young lady. This is expressed when she says, 'I fell asleep working on my essay,' and also when she says, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good a job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
One trait described in the story from Rose talking to Anna is caring. Rose is having a rough time trying to handle school, work, and everything else. Even though Rose feels as if she cannot breath when Anna stumbles into the kitchen Rose puts Anna's feelings before here own. Rose trys to tell Anna that everything will be okay, and that she will have nothing to worry about.
Rose's aunt sugests making treats from their country and selling them. Aunt Kolab wants to share their Cambodian tradition with the people of their new country and help them understand Cambodian tradition, while at the same time she wants to make some money to help the family out.
She is a selfless person. An example of this is how she is willing to help out around the house even though it stresses her out because she realizes how it will improve her family's future.
One trait that can describe Rose is optimistic. After the conversation with Aunt Kolab she was confident that her life could get easier.
One trait that describes Rose would be that she is understanding. An example was in the conversation with Aunt Kolab when whe nods her head as a response.
One trait that I noticed of Anna was that she is very caring and has a big heart. When she had her dream, her aunt had woken her up, and she wanted to so badly tell someone but she didn't want to tell her aunt because she didn't want to hurt her aunt's feelings. That shows how caring she is and that she has a big heart.
Rose is kind of fake for example in paragraph 12 she said i tried a laugh that even sounded fake even to me.
Rose is very protective to her family.  She works had every day by going to school, working four hour shift, then home to help her Aunt.  Rose tries to be the best she can for her family by never giving up even if she is exhausted.
Rose is very hopeful. In the passage the author states 'Rose kept nodding. Mayber her life would get easier.'
Anna is really looking forward to getting all that weight lifted from her shoulder's because she is only in high school and trying to help her mother support their family. 'Only if you already have everything,' Rose said. She tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her. ' We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.' (Paragraph 11)
One triat about Rose is that when she tells about her feelings she doesnt really express them too much. Anna seems the same way, like if she does have alot to say and that she feels a certain way she doesnt express it well. Anna just keeps everything inside, like in paragraph 9-10, when Anna && Rose were having a conversation the topic about their father was that Rose felt he's been gone forever. An that the job he has now in L.A pays really good money than the job he had at home. Ana who look at Rose she was like 'money isn't everything', to me it sounded like she is very upset that her dad is so far away and that Anna does really miss him.
She understands and listens to what others have to say. When Anna was talking to her, Rose helped her out. She explained and help Rose understand some things. She tried her best to make Anna not feel so lonely.     When she had a conversation with Aunt Kolab, Rose didn't really talk about much. She doesn't like to talk about her feelings. She likes to keep her feelings bottled up inside.
One trait that describes Rose is, overwhelmed. I think Rose is overwhelmed because of the 3,000 word essay that she has to write to help get her brother into college, and also haveing to work a job and help make supper.
One trait of Rose is she is very faithful. She wants her family to be happy even if she is not. You can tell this when she is talking to Anna, telling her that everything will turn out for the best, it will just take some time.
one trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab would be that Rose is a very busy girl with very little time on her hands. ' The day, like most of her days, had been too long, too demanding. from school she's gone straight to the resturant to work a four hour shift, then go straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper.
Rose is caring because when her sister walks in rubbing her eyes, the first thing Rose asks her is if she is alright.
Rose is caring when she talks to other people because when she was talking with her aunt she thinks, 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.' This shows that she cares about how other people feel.
According to this particular story, Rose is depicted as discouraged. The story explains how Aunt Kolab asked Rose if she felt weighed down by what she was doing to help her family and Rose had no response, signifying a sense of discourageness or hopelessness.
Rose feels in urgent need to relate to her dreams, but yet she is very exposed to the fact that the truth might hurt. She is starting to relize she needs to see things throught others eyes not just her own.
Stressed because she is in a situatuion where she has to support her family and when she talks to her aunt she expresses her stressfulness.
Rose wants the best for her family.Because she talks to her sister about going to coledge.
She is a very worried person that has alot riding on her shoulder. So that she can go to collage and then send monry back so that her sister can go.
Rosa tries not to upset others. She tries to make them feel better by saying, 'We have our part to do to help paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college,' to Anna.
Rose is very sincere. In paragraph 8, sentence 1 it says that Rose said, ' It's only been four months,' as gently as she could. She wanted to help her realize why and wanted to do it so Anna wouldn't get mad at her.
I think that Rose is stubborn, because when she and her sister were talking, shen got mad and walked out of the kitchen.
She tries to be the mother of the family for her sister Anna. 'Its only been four months.' Rose said as gently as she could. 'He had to go. The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here.'
In the story, Rose feels that she is having to work on things and can not get them done.  She feels that the weight of the world is resting on her shoulders.  In her second dream when she dreams that she swam through clear, green-tinted water she is struggling to get out from under her brothers weight when he accidentally jumps into the water on top of her.  This symbolizes that she can't get out from the image that her brother has set for her to live up to.  When she talks with her aunt after the dream, she feels that someone understands that she is going through a lot and that she just needs to do what she will to get through it.  One trait in the story that stood out is that she is a hard worker and that she feels that she can't live up to the standards that her brother set for her to accomplish.
She trys to help her sister out when she thinks her father is not spending enough time at home with their mother. Rose tells her sister that their father had to go and that the job paid more and it would help to go to college.
She is always looking to the future. Like in the second sentance of paragraph 23 she said 'maybe her life would get easier'.
One trait that best describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna is hateful. She didn't like the fact that her mom is working extra hours at work. Also, she hated that her father is gone away on a bussiness trip.
Rose had many traits in this story but one that stud out to me was her welling to do everthing. She gos to school, works helps her aunt, and deffends her father about what Anna is saying.
Rose was always determined to write the paper and win the trip. she never really enjoyed the paper but she set her mind to it.
Rose is very determined because when she first talks to Anna she doesn't seem to care about what Rose is trying to accomplish. Then when she talks to Aunt Kolab she knows almost automaticly what she wants to write about thanks to her Aunt forgiving her encouragement.
A trait that describes Rose would be her great helping attitude with her family. After school she would go to the restaurant and work four hour shifts. Then she would go home and help Aunt Kolab with supper for the family. After that she had time to work on her homework. She put the needs of others before the needs of herself.
She was stressed about the competition and how she was going  to enter when she has a job to attend to. She talks about this and the dream she had because she was also conserned if it meant something in her life that has been currently being going on. To support this answer she says, 'Even if i were to win, she thought, I won't get to travle to Sacramento to recieve the prize.'
Anna is a dreamer, not in a sense of sleep, but of ambitions. She's always talking about going other places like the green tinted water in her dream.
Responsible would be a trait to describe Rose. She has a job to pay for Paul's college.
One of Anna's traits is that she is jealous of Paul because he is in college. She gets mad when other people try to stand up for him. One example is this passage is when Rose told Anna that Paul will get a good job after college and even pay for them to go to college, she just rolled her eyes, pushed the chair aways from the table, and told Rose she sounded just like their mom.
Rose is, first of all, stressed out because of the things going on in her life, with school, working a 4 hour shift at a resteraunt, coming home and helping the family with supper, and then homework, and sure enough it'd be time for bed soon after. So during her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab, you can  tell she has a stressed out tone, and is very serious about getting the things she needs to get done, done.
She feels her life is hard since she is trying to help the family get through hard times. Aunt Kolab: 'Do you feel so weighd down by what you're doing to help this family?'
Rose is sensitive and cares about others feelings. when Rose was thinking that if she told the tuth about how she was feeling and thinking that she would hurt her aunt's feeling's it shows how she feels about tother's feelings.
Rose feels weighed down by what she is doing to help her family but cannot tell her Aunt Kolab because she would hurt her Aunt's feelings. This trait comes from Rose's conversation with Aunt Kolab when Aunt Kolab asks her, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'
One trait that can describe Rose is supportive.  As Rose talks to Anna in this story she keeps telling Anna how everything will work out.  Rose has other thoughts about the situation, but she keeps them to her self to make her younger sister feel better about the situation.  She tells Anna, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.  Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'  This shows that Rose, no matter how weighted down she feels, will always give a supportive answer for her sister to make things seem alright.
Rose is mature for her age therefore she can understand the importance of everything that her family is doing. An example from the story would be 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
In this short story, Rose is having a conversation with her sister about how she is sad that her Papa has to work somewhere else for money. It states 'She tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her (Rose).' which tells the reader that Rose is trying to hide how tired she is, and the ridiculous amount of responsibility she has for her family. From that aspect of the story, Rose seems like a very brave young girl to work hard for her family.
respectful. 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.'
Rose seems to care more about family then a lot of things. I think that the reason she is having bad dreams is because she stressing so much about her family and the 3 thousand word essay that she has to write and hasn't done yet. But i think that she just had to realize what he most important thing was after all.
She worries about everyone except herself.She feels that she has to take on a big responsibility for her family.
Rose is very strong-willed because when Anna said to her, 'money isn't everything.' Rose immediately snapped back and disagreed with her.
When Rose wanted to expres who she feel and the dream  she had but she didn' know how to. A example is when 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell  her mother.'
Rose wants to help her brother get to college to get a good job in the future so her and her sister can hopefully go to college someday. One detail from the story is when she says that her brother has both of his little sisters fate in his hands.
Rose has a lot of stress and responsibiltiies. After telling her aunt about the dream
She is scared. 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother'.
She is only thinging about the money end of life and not about living for the moment Anna tells her this by saying 'money is not everything'.
I believe that two obvious traits that Rose possesses is hope and courage. Though she was troubled by how her life had been, upon talking to her Aunt she felt a lighthearted peace within herself. She knew that things may or may not change but she also knew she could make the best of whatever happened.
SHE DOES NOT TELL THE TRUTH TO HER AUNT SO SHE DOES NOT HURT HER.
I think her conversation with Anna made her seem like she is a very caring person of how she was asking whats wrong or are u feeling ok.
Dragged, because of the dream she had the night before that she told her aunt.
Rose has a positive attitude towards papa being gone. She reminds her sister why he's gone, and points out he will be able to pay for thier college, when he is done working.
Rose is guarded. She doesn't want to let her guard down and this is obvious when her laugh 'sounded fake even to her'.
One trait that can describe Rose is selfless. During the conversation with Aunt Kolab, Rose doesnt want to answer Aunt Kolab's question or tell the truth about her true feelings of being such a big part in supporting the family. Rose didnt want to hurt Aunt Kolab, or make her feel bad.
Rose felt tha her life would get easier.
Rose is a hard worker. She takes many things upon herself such as helpinh her brother graduate.
I find her stubborn, or rude really. In her conversation with Anna, Anna is upset because her father is away. Rose completely subsides the sadness Anna feels and begins speaking of money.
One treat that can describe Rose would be positivety.  During her conversation with Anna, Rose told her that they have their part to do to help Paul finish college, then he'll get a good job and that he'll pay for Anna and her to go to college.  Even during hard times Rose still told Anna that eventually things would work out and they would get to go to college as well as Paul.
She is busy because she has school, work, and help make dinner. It also says 'When would she squeeze in writing a flawless three-thousand-word essay?'
hopeful.           maybe her life would get easier.
From hearing her aunt's point of view, Rose not only found her topic for her essay, she felt lighter from her aunt's offer to help her. Rose kept nodding. Maybe her life would get easier. Maybe it wouldn't. But her aunt's offer had somehow made her feel lighter. Suddenly, it occurred to her: here was the topic for her essay, although it was still vague. Cambodian tradition and sense of family, she realized, could survive an ocean crossing.
Anna is very caring about other people's feelings. In paragraph 19 it reveals Anna didnt want to hurt her Aunt Kolabs feelings. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.
Based on her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab, Rose seems to have trouble with internal conflicts.  She is fighting a war with herself that makes her feel that she has too much resposibility placed on herself.  For all of the work she has done for her older brother, she wonders how her life would be different if she had not been forced to do so much work.
One trait that can describe Rose when she is talking to Aunt Kolab is when she thinks that her life might get easier, maybe it won't, but she has a topic for her paper.
Rose is very responsible, and she states: 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.'
Rose is patient. She tells Anna how all their struggles will be worthwhile when Paul pays for them to go to college.
One trait Rose has is maturity. Matuirty is represented in paragraph nine when Rose is explaining why her Dad had to move away. She is explaining it like it is what is best for the household.
One trait that I believe can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab is calm. I think this is a good trait to describe Rose because while she was talking to her younger sister Anna, she came up with reasons to help her sister understand why her father and mother are out working and not there with them. Another reason is because while her aunt was talking to her, her Aunt was talking about ways to make Rose feel better. As Rose listened to her aunts suggestions, she calmly nodded her head, in agreement to her aunt.
One trait that can describe Rose is stress. Why I say stress is because in the begining she is getting home from having to work all the time. Also she has a long essay to write along with fixing food. With all of this going on its going to cause stress on her which is causing her dreams. Since she realizes this she goes and talks to her aunt even if she wanted to hold it all inside.
She is someone who can get very discouraged easily. Cause she is always worried about how late her mom has to work. Also about getting all her homework done then going strait to work. She thinks she is always pushed for time.
that rose always had a understand of her aunt kolab because she will kno what her aunt will do
She has alot of frustration in side that she wants to let out but has to hold back and the reason that i think this is because she says if she would of answered and told the truth she would of hurt her aunt.
When Rose is talking to Anna in the kitchen, you get the sense that Rose wants to please her family. She feels weighted down by all she has to do, yet she puts on a smile and attempts to act like she's fine. When Rose and Anna are talking about money, Rose tries to make light of the subject by making a joke and laughing. Although, her laugh sounds fake even to her.
In the convorsation Rose had with her younger sister Anna, she seem to be strong. She was being postive about the situation with her father. I feel she was being this way towards her sister to give her comfort, and make it seem like things arnt as bad as they seem.
One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab is with Aunt Kolab, Rose is an American, she doesn't remeber Cambodia, therefore Aunt Kolab has to teach her of Cambodia, with Aunt Kolab deciding to bring a little of Cambodia to America when Aunt Kolab says, 'Hmm. Maybe we can find a way to do things differently. A way better for you.' and 'Maybe I can sew for ladies. Or I could make special treats from our country and sell them.'.
In Rose's conversation with Anna, Rose's leadership shines through.  Despite her exhaustion and discouragment, Rose patiently encourages her sister.  Rose reminds Anna of the overall goal of Paul's graduation and him paying for their own college education.  Rose overlooks her own problems to help lead her sister.
Rose seems dedicated because even during her talk with Aunt Kolab she thinks of something she could use for her essay. In the beggining of the story, it talks about how even though she has so many other things to handle, she still makes time to write her essay.
Rose seems to be a very caring character throughout this story. When she talks to Anna and tries to make her feel better, her caring personality shines through to the readers.
Rose is very caring. An example of this trait can be seen when she asks Anna if she is alright. After asking her if she was ok she went and poured her a glass of orange juice.
Rose is determined. She's not only worried about herself, but Paul also. Rose said, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.' She's willing to do whatever it takes for her family so Paul can get a good job and her and her sister Anna can go to college.
she is a very egar person  .
Faith, in the story she says, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job.'
They both worry.
'Only if you have everything.' Rose always seems negative with no hope.
Rose is misrible, and she knows it; however, she tries not to show it, and wants to stay strong for the sake of the rest of her family.  Aunt Kolab asks Rose, 'Do you feel so weighted down by what you're doing to help this family?'  Rose didn't want to answer her aunt out of fear of harming her or her mother.  To Rose, other peoples' feelings matter more.
One trait to describe Rose would be pressured. Rose is constantly busy. Her job, family ,and a three-thousand-word essay are occuping her time. 'In Cambodia, our first country, what we're all doing would be quite normal,' Rose's aunt said to Rose near the end of the passage. This detail suggests that Rose's Aunt and parents are used to the pressure that they might not be able to see things through an American girl's eyes.
Rose was fed up with everything she had to do, and she wanted her dad to come home. She still worked and did her homework. rose did not complain, so I would say she is patient.
Rose is very caring. She encourages her sister that everything is going to be alright and life will get better for them, even though she is feeling doubtful in herself. She assures Anna that their dad is away to make things better for them and be able to send them both to college.
She is always hopeful.  'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
I think Rose seems to be caring about not just herself, but of her family. In the beggining of the story she asks how her sister is feeling. She cares fro Paul. She also helps out Aunt Kolab.
they both have attitudes
She is very mature because of the way that she talks to her sister about helping the family out at such a young age.
She feels very stressed out. Why is that, because the story says, 'She felt to young for so much responsibility'.
helpful greatful and loving money isn't everything
She is a very worryfilled person when she states that she dreamt of the weight of her brother on her shoulders in the water.
She seems very confident that something may happen. When she was having a conversation with her sister in the kitchen she looked at the positive of their father working is Los Angeles.
Anna is stuggling hoping her life would get easer
Rose can be described as hardworking. In this story she is very hardworking because she goes straight from school to her job, and then home to help Aunt Kolab cook supper.
she's a little grumpy because when she comes in sounds like she's giving attitude to everyone which dont make her look good
One trait that Rose has is that she is very cautious of others feelings and tries to not upset them. An example of this trait would be when Aunt Kolab asked Rose if she felt weighted down by what she was doing for the family, and to avoid hurting Aunt Kolab she didn't respond.
She is very weighed down, but at the same time she is doing it cause she has to help her family.  She is a very giving person by giving up her time to work for her brother and make money for him to finish colledge.  'From school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper.  After thst it ws time to do homework.'
She is very unopen with how she really feels to the rest of the family. Even though she is struggling with everything she tries to make them see positive.
Rose shows that she can be very understanding of other peoples' thoughts.  When she was talking to her sister she tried to show that she understood how her sister felt.  When she was talking to her aunt she understood that life in Cambodia was much different than hers.
Burdened, 'His body sank as if it were made of stone, pushing her beneath him down under him, but he seemed unaware of her.'
Rose wants to please the people in her family.  She often held back from expressing her true emotions in order to spare the feelings of the others in her family.  For example, in paragraph 19, Rose held back from telling her Aunt Kolab that she did feel weighted down by helping her family.
I believe that Rose is overwhelmed by having to go to school and work. One example is that her aunt offers to sew for ladies or make special treats from their home country and sell them to bring in some extra money.
In the story, Rose changes the subject when Anna reveals that she had had a bad dream. This shows me that Rose is too concerned about her own problems. Also, Aunt Kolab starts offering to do extra work so that Rose wouldn't have to do as much work, and this also shows to me that she is to concentrated on how busy she is.
SHE DOSEN'T WANT TO HURT HER AUNT'S FEELINGS SO SHE DOESN'T ANWSER HER AUNT. THAT PROVES SHE CARES FOR HER FAMILY AND IS A KIND AND CARING PERSON IT DECRIBES HER.
One trait that can  be described about Rose is that she is a very hard working person who just wants the best out of her familys' life.One detail from the story that represents my answer is when she was talking to Anna about how she was explaining the situation about the family and how if they help paul finish college, he could get a good job and help support the family.
ON trait that can describe Rose based on her conversation with Aunt Kilab is that she cares about others' feelings. 'Rose didn't answer.  If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.'
Rose has the trait of responsibility.  She has to go to school, work a four-hour shift, then prepare homework.  After that she must finish homework.
one trait is haveing to help others no matter what it takes and seeing what other people think about things. I no this from the conversation with her aunt, and her aunt thinks the same way as rose does.
One tof many traits Rose has is selfishness. Rose knows deep down the troubles and problems she has, most people have also. But Rose makes it seem like she only cares about herself. For example, her sister told her she had a bad dream, and all Rose had to talk about was her essay.
One trait that can describe Rose is that she is hard working, one detail from the story that can support my answer is that she goes strait from school to her job which is a four-hour shift, and then when she gets home from work she goes right to doing her homework.
Her trait is that she can see things form another's point of view. Eplination. When her and Rose were talking she was looking at the situation from Pauls point of view.
I think one trait that describes Rose is that she sounds like her mom.  When Anna and her are talking on paragraph 12 ' You sound just like Mama.'
I think Rose tries to help the family out a lot, but being so young and trying to do everything is hard for her. While Rose was talking to her Aunt Kolab, her aunt said, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose only nodded and fell silent. I think this shows that Rose is young and does a lot for her family/
One trait that can descibe Rose would be that she is opptimistic she keeps thinking everything is going to get easier. In the last paragraph she is thinking maybe my life will get easier.
She doesn't want others to be upset and keeps her bad comments to herself. She is not use to the way they are living because she didn't grow up in Cambodia
A trait that describes Rosa is caring. Not only does she care about school and doing her best, she cares about her family. In the conversation with Anna, Rosa tries to help Anna understand the difficult situation, but also show her that she cares. In the conversation with Aunt Kolab, Rosa wants to tell her aunt how she feels, but since she cares for her family, she remains silent so she wouldn't hurt her aunt's feelings.
A trait that Rose has is overworking herself. She goes to school, goes to work, and worries about finishing her essay assignment. She's so involved with her family struggles and her job, that she can not even take the trip to Sacramento if her essay is the best.
That she is very selfish because she thinks that everything needs to help her via the quotations of her saying that it isnt fair that their dad has been gone for 4 months.
Rose wants to help her family no matter the cost. This shows that Rose is an unselfish person, as stated in the story, 'Paul's fate lies partly in these, she thought. She felt too young for so much responsibility. Then she shivered, imagining how her brother must feel. Only three years older, he held the fate of two people--both his sisters--in his hands.'
Rose seems to be very responsible. When she was talking with her sister at the table in the kitchen, she tried to make her sister feel better and comfort her. She assured her that her father was doing the right thing by working in Los Angeles.
Rose seems to be a concerned person. One example i'll use, is when rose had a convrsation with her aunt. Rose needed to talk about the dream, to expose it, so it woluld loosen a grip on her.
One trait than can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab is sincere. An example that supports my answer is that when Anna was walking in the kitchen, rubbing her eyes.
Over run, Rose is so busy with all of her responsibilities that she has reached a point of hoplesness.  Ahe also feels wieghed down by her brother and his  hard times.
Rose feels very pationate about the conversations she's having with her sister and her Aunt Kolab. She feels like she has to do a lot for her family to keep her brother in college until he graduates. A detail that supports this is her dream she had.
That she is a hard worker and that she really cares about her family.
Rose cares about other peoples feelings. She tried to save her brother from being crushed by a boulder.
Rosa is caring of her sister, she really wants to know whats wrong and wants to help the situation. Rosa said to Anna 'What's wrong/ You feel okay?.' They also talked about there grandpa moving away and how its been hard on them both.
She is hopeful saying maybe life would get better.
Rose is under stress/ pressure over all her school work, falling asleep while doing it.more stress is added when she has to help her brother graduate, and her mother being gone for work.
Rose trys to be adult as she can be and has so much wieght on her shoulders she isn't sure what to do but she still trys. I think she has adult traits to her, she is willing to try and help her brother get a good job as well as talk to her aunt about her need for help.
Rose is a caring person.  She feels bad for the way she is feeling about her familie's situation right now.  Rose doesnt want to tell her aunt the truth because it would hurt Aunt Kolab and her mother.
She is very rude because she interupts everyone else. When she asked if her sister was alright she just interupts her and tells Anna what happend to her instead of letting Anna finish what she was going to say.
Rose is the type of person that makes the situation seem less difficult by holding her own doubts in from her sister. In a way she is protecting her sister and keeping Anna's hopes up. Her sister probably looks up to Rose so she needs to seem confident, so Anna won't lose confidence. But when talking to her Aunt, she felt comfortable enough to let her true feelings go. Because her Aunt has the role of helping Rose. And Rose helps Anna. And together, they can help each other have faith.
One trait that describes Rose is hopeless. At first in this story, Rose is talking to her sister and seems very down. She is explaining to Anna that maybe one day they will have it good. She doesn't even seem to believe her own words. When Rose is talking to her Aunt Kolab she is also coming off as a hopeless person. Aunt Kolab says something that turns her attitude around.
Rose is a responsible, young woman who tries her best at everything she does, but is facing some tough times after Paul left. 'When would she squeeze in writing a flawless three thousand-word essay?'
One trait that can describe Rose is hard working. Most of her days are long and demanding, 'from school she'd [go] straight to the restaurant to work a four - hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After that it was time to do homework.'
One trait that decribes Rose would be caring. The way she talks to her sister, Anna, lets you see she cares about her. One detail from the story that shows this is when her sister walked in rubbing her eyes. Seeing her like that made her worried about her and asked what was wrong and if she felt alright.
ose is givingRose dose stuff for eveyone else such as get a job and try to make her sister feel beter and dosent ask for anything in return.
ONE TRAIT TO DESCRIBE ROSE IS CARING. IN THE STORY WHEN SHE IS TALKING TO HER AUNT SHE HOLDS IN HOW SHE REALLY FEELS SO SHE DOESN'T HURT ANYONES FEELINGS.
In their eyes Rose was a self-centered little brat, and only cared about what she wanted and not anyone else. When Rose went in and told Anna about her bad dream Anna began telling Rose about how she fell asleep writing her thousand- word essay.
Rose is loyal to her family for what she is doing to help her brother pay for college. It shows she is loyal when she can feel the weight from her family, but still continues to do what she has to do.
Rose is optimistic. You see this in her conversation with her sister Anna when she says that after they help Paul graduate, he will be able to help them go to college.
She is caring for her sister. She asks her sister what is wrong and if she feels okay.
She is  helpful, because in the story it said, ' Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Which make it sound like she is a very helpful person.
Rose is a very determined individual. She has a very busy schedule consisting of school, work, housework, and homework, but she never gives up. She keeps pushing herself for the better of her familiy, and even tries to squeeze in extra work for the satisfactory of herself.
In the first conversation she has she seens concered but yet she also seems like her mind is in another place like she can't focas...
I think that Rose is very responsible, because she has a job, has to go to school, and she has to help around the house and cook dinner.
Rose is a caring young lady. She cares for her sister and cares for her family. she treats her sister nice by tlking to her in the middle of the night when she had a bad dream.
Rose is very hesitent, 'Rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream, to expose it so it would loosen its grip on her.''Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'
That Rose is always stressed out.A detail from the story is the three-thousand-word essay.
Rose can't see how her family is trying to help her, with giving her inside clues that she doesnt see or get, until the end with her aunt.
Responsible. She's trying to do everything right, and not hurt anyone. But, she's just a kid. And, it all becomes to heavy of a load to carry.
Rose is the type of person who doesn't express her thoughts because she fears she will upset someone. In the conversation with Aunt Kolab, Rose doesn't answer her aunt when she asks, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose feels that if she gave an honest answer to Aunt Kolab, her aunt would be hurt.
One trait that Rose described with her conversation with her Aunt Kolab might be that shes actually understood, her Aunt Kolab sees her stress and her fustration. Rose wants to do everything she possibly can but its too much for one person. Shes working at a resturante for four hours after school. Shes going to school. She helps her Aunt Kolab with supper and she finds time to do her homework. Shes feeling a bit stressed with her situation. When her Aunt Kolab realizes that Rose is working really hard and is fustrated with everything, she talks to her to try and understand or see if theirs anything she can do for Rose. The talk helps it shows that Rose is being looked after and that her family can see how hard she is working.
She works hard because her aunt offers to  do some work to make some money.
Rose is troublesome, she thinks that she has no time to get everything done.
Rose is a hard working young lady. She works a four hour shift every night and then comes home, cooks, and completes her home work
The first trait that I think of when I read this conversation is how caring Rose is. She has a lot of responsiblilities with her school work and her job. Although she seems very tied up all the time, she still finds the time to ask her sister how she is doing, and try to comfort her with her problems, while also encountering her own. We can tell right away that Anna is very upset, but Rose is acting very mature, and tries to help her in any way so that she will feel a little more relaxed. In conclusion, I feel that Rose was very caring. A person that can endure all of the responsiblilities that she has, and still be as caring as she is shows us one of her greatest traits, caring.
Rose is optomistic. He hopes for the best but doesn't always see it happening. When she talks to Anna, she tells her that things will change after Paul's college is paid off. Yet, she doesn't seem to confident in what she is saying.
Rose is an optimistic person. When talking to Anna, she stays optimistic about the fact that her father is far away at his job, but he is making more money, and he hasn't been away too long. She also is optimistic because her brother is in college, and when he graduates and gets a good job, he will be able to pay for Rose's and Anna's college education.
Rose is respectful. She doesn't want to hurt her aunts feelings by telling her the truth that she feels to weighed down by the responsability she has for the family.
Courageous becuase she has the courage to tell her aunt the way she feels we she feels all alone and no one cares.
rose is a had worker bacuse she has no time to work on her essay.
The one trait about Anna from the story Crossing Over that I would pick is dedication. Anna is very dedicated to her job and helping her family when they are in need of it most.'The day, like most of her days, had been too long, too demanding. From school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four-hour shft, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper.'
One of Rose's traits is that she does not like to admit her feelings to others. In her conversation with Anna she acts as though she does not care about how long her father has been gone or how long her mother works.
One identifying trait as to who Rose is that, she is a studious person as describle in the passage.When she first talks to  her sister in the first paragarph,she says 'i feel asleep doing my essay' and that intitles to me that she cares about her school work
The essay she has to write is complicated for her to do. 'I fell asleep working on my essay'
SHE NEVER HAS FREE TIME.SHE HAD TO SQUEEZE STUDING IN HER SCEDUAL
Rose is very conflicted by her responsibilities. She has to work a job, go to school, and help around her house to help send her brother to college. She is conflicted by her responsibility to her family and her exhaustion. the dream she experiences about her brother Paul confirms this.
One trait that describes Rose based on her conersation with Anna is, that she is sincere and cares about her. I think this because she asks Anna if she is feeling okay, and tells her the truth about why their dad had to go away. And later after Anna left, Rose went in her bedroom to check on her, but Anna had already fell asleep.
She is sad because of her Papa, because he had to go to Los Angeles to work and she doesn't like that.She feels so lonely.She said that the money are not the most important thing in life and she would be happier if Papa was there with her.
Rose is responsible, and she just wants to do good and be a good sister.
I think that rose is a shy girl and doesnt want everyone knowing her business. The essay she has to get done for the state competition is making her feel exhausted and moody.
Shy busy is very busy and doesnt use her time wisely, she needs to plan out when she needs to do stuff.
The trait that describes Rose based on her conversation with Anna would be helpful. 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
Greatfull 'Cambodian tradition and sense of family, she realized, could survive an ocean crossing'.
When Rose is talking to Anna she shows that she is supportive of her parents decisions.  An example would be when she supports her father decision to work in Los Angeles.
Figuring stuff out. She has to write this essay and she does all this other stuff so she has to figure it out.
'Ana,' Rose said. 'What's wrong? You feel okay?' 'I'm fine,' her sister said. 'I just had another bad dream.' 'I fell asleep working on my essay,' Rose said.
One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversation with Aunt Kolab is determination. She is determined to help make a better life for her and her family, even though it isn't easy. Her Aunt Kolab is willing to help her by selling special treats from Cambodia and selling them, or by sewing for ladies.
Even though Rose has a lot going on in her life, she still takes the time to be caring for her sister. When Anna has a bad dream, Rose says, ''What's wrong? You feel okay?'' When Anna is feeling down, Rose tries to lighten the situation by saying, ''It's only been four months.'' This clearly shows that Rose is caring.
One trait that can describe Rose from her conversation with Aunt Kolab would be when she didn't want to tell the truth to her Aunt. Her not telling the truth to her Aunt, shows that she is very conserned on other peoples feelings. She doesn't want to tell the truth and then hurt her Aunts feelings so she remains quiet. She also doesn't want to tell her Aunt because she belives that she will go and tell her mom about what she told her Aunt on how she really feels.
One trait about Rose is that she thinks through things.  She thought about every thing in her days.
Rose is discouraged because of the dream she has and the conversation she has with her sister.
When Rose talks with Aunt Kalob, she listens to what she has to say. Rose makes sure to think about what Aunt Kalob is saying and takes it to heart. In the story, Rose didn't want to tell her aunt the truth about how she felt about being weighed down by her family, but she still listened to her aunts suggestions for making money.
She is very hardworking. When the story tells you that she is constantly busy and doesn't have the time to work on this essay.
She is a good sister.Rose slid into the bed with Anna.
When Rose speaks with her aunt she seems tough. She trys to stay strong so she doesn't worry or upset her aunt or mother. When she really does have some stuff going on inside she would like to talk about.
Anna cares about other people, even when it causes stress for her.  She really shows this when she talks to Anna about Paul going to college.  She tells Anna that they have to do their part to help him finish college.  She says this even though it is obvious that the situation is hard for her.
Rose is a very posistive individual. The way that she keeps up a happy appearance when she is talking to her little sister proves this statement. 'He had to go. The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here.'
One trait that Rose has is that she can be very reasurring. An example is when she explains to Anna that their dad was gone for a very important reason and that they have an important part to do to help Paul finish college.
One trait that can describe Rose would be hardworking. I would use this because thru out the whole story she is working on somthing if it isn't homework it is somthing around the house that she is doing.
Rose is stumped on if she could squeeze in the essay or not, and that if she tries then she'll be even more packed than what she already is with trying to help out her family already. Rose feels like she is doing her best, but that it also might not be enough. She doesn't really want to tell anyone about her problems either because they might make their problems a little bit more worse.     Aunt Kolab said, with a puzzled look, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.
I would say that Rose is a smart girl. She seem to be a hard worker as well. Going to school then going to work and then making dinner for her family and in between doing homework. The one thing I see in her is that she cares about her family alot. She trys to tell her little sister that in the long run this will help her out. It takes alot to tell someone what they do not want to hear but it shows that you care for them.
Rose tries to do what is best for her family, she always put others in front of herself.ex. 'In the dark Rose clasped then cupped her hands. Paul's fate lies partly in these, she thought.'
One trait that can describe Rose is worried because in her conversation with Anna she is worried about life with her need to bring up talking about paying for college.
Rose has a hard time focusing on hey essay.  Because in the story she fell alseep working on it.
A word that describe her is caring. Rose kindly asked her sister if she was ok.
Rose is a type of person who tries to hide her feelings.
In her conversation with Anna rose appears to be really hopeful. She tells her sister that if they do their part and help out with the Paul's college fees then he'll get a good job and help them go to college.
Rose does not like to burden others with her own problems. She likes to keep to herself and try to help others even though she is hurting inside.
In this story, Rose is a hard worker.  She does everything she can to juggle her life and to try to keep it in order.  Rose was trying to write an essay, take care of her sister, and go to the restaurant and work all at the same time.  She is the type to never give up, to keep doin all that she can to keep her life in check.  Rose was given so much responsibility and it is weighing down on her, but she keeps striving to make things right.
She feels all tied up with life. Trying to do everything she can to stay on track. Staying up late working on school work to get in finished for the next day.
Rose is very caring. She is doing everything she can to make ends meet for her family while she is still very young. She wants to help Paul, her brother, finish college, so when he gets done he will help her and her sister get through college. The passage states, 'Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
She is feeling ashumed becaused she feels that she is depended on to much then a normal teenager should be depened on. She tells Aunt Kolab about the dream that is the exemaple that is being used
She takes resonsibility for her family because after her four hour shift she go straight home and helps her aunt with supper.
One trait that can identify Rose is hopeful. When Rose talks to Anna she tried to make things seem better than they actually were: 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college'.
Rose feels like she has alot of stress on her to complete duty that have to be done. She said ' her brain must have surrendered to exhaustion.' That lets the readers know shes dealing with stress that has her overwhelmed.
Rose has an over-developed sense of responsibility as she is pressured to work herself into exhaustion to help support her brother.  She feels an obligation to work, yet she does not like it.  Her aunt asks her if she feels 'so weighed down by what [she's] doing to help this family.'  She suppresses her answer, which shows that she is embarassed by it so it must be yes.  Once her aunt offers to help support the family, Rose feels 'lighter.'  Her family's culture prevents her from freeing her burdens from herself and that causes her to become responsible.
When Rose is speaking with Anna Rose says that they must help out sence there brother is trying to get through collage so he can pay for them to go to collage.
She feels like she is not responsible. Her parents and family are counting too much on her.
She is trying to find a way to help her family. She needs help because she feels gilty for something she couldn't stop.
Rose is understanding because she explained to her younger sister Anna that their father had to take the job in Los Angeles because the money was supporting the family.
Rose is considerate of other people's feelings. 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.'
Rose is not living an easy life. But she is doing what she can to make the best of it. One trait Rose greatly exemplifies is hardwork.      Rose goes to school and has a part-time job. I know from first-hand experience that that is very hard work. Juggling the two is very stressful at times. When Rose explains what her day consisted of, it truely shows that she is a hardworker and is striving to achieve a greater goal.      'From school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After that it was time to do homework.' (paragraph 1) This example shows how busy she is, but it also proves how hard she must be working.
I'm not sure if being depressed is a trait, but I feel like Rose is very stressed out. When her sister tells her that she had a bad dream Rose completely ignore her. I believe that Rose wasn't ignoring her on purpose, but had her mind on a million things, and couldn't focus.
During Rose's conversation with her aunt, the passage says, 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.' I think this clearly identifys that she feels this need to help everyone. She feels like it's her duty to help her brother through college, and to protect her aunts feelings. In a lot of ways she has the leadership trait.
One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations is she is responsible. An example of this is when Rose was talking to her sister Anna. Rose is worried about the family and how they don't have enough money while Anna isn't worried about it because she believes all she needs is family. Rose knows that if they want Paul to graduate college then they are going to need more money. That's Rose's main concern.
Rose feels over-worked and feels like she has to do everything by herself. She feels like she has no time to do anything. 'When would she squeeze in writing a flawless three-thousand word essay?' (par.3 sent.1)
rose is hard working. she goes to school then she goes to work, then she comes home and helps with dinner, then she does her homework. that is alot to do in such a short time period.
Rose is really trying not to let her feelings show. 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.'
Rose seems to be so tired and frustrated with how busy and different her life is that she doesn't feel like doing anything. She seems like she doesn't want to hurt anybody's feelings, such as her aunt when she asks if she feels so weighed down by what she was doing to help her family. It seems like Rose just needs a break and a day to relax to get back to normal.
Rose is a good listener and can make good judgement calls.
she is lonely
Rose is vey independent, she knows what she has to do in order to have the life that she wants, and she will do whatever it takes. When Anna tells her that money isn't everythings, Rosa replies, ' Only if you already have everything. We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.'
Rose is trustworthy, she listens to what people say and believes that everything will work out in the end. In her conversation with Anna she repeated what her mom said would happen after her brother gets out of college. Showing just how much she trusts them.
The trait that I think Rose on her conversations is she should be more like Anna cause Rose thinks more like Anna and then Rose tries to do her three paragraph eassy.
One trait that could describe Rose based on her conversations with her sister and aunt would be Conflicted. 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.
She is very strest out of all the things she has to do. She is tierd of all the things in her life that she has to do.
One trait that describes Rose would be hopeful, because from the story she tell her sister, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college'.
In her conversation with Anna, the reader can see that Rose realizes the extent of her responibilities and duties to her family, specifically her brother. However, she shows that she wants to appear mature to Anna, and instead of telling her how she really felt, she tries to look at the situation from a practical and adult-like viewpoint, and appears 'just like Mama.' Rose's responses to Anna, such as 'money isn't everything' show that she is unwilling and embarassed for Anna to see how she really feels.
She want to tell her sister how she really feel. May be its because she does not want her sister to worry. She tells her sister that she is fine and that nothings wrong but her sister nows better.      When she is talking to her aunt she says nothing to her at all. Her aunt tries to talk to her but nothing. Exept at the end of the conversation she at least nodes at her aunt. She feels very overwelmed.
Rose is a very positve person. This trait is shown when Rose remains positive when talking to Anna, for she does not want to upset her.
Rose wants to be a helper, by doing things to help her family get through the hard time. As she said 'Maybe I can sew for ladies'.
One trait to describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab would be overwhelmed. She is overwhelmed because the article says 'she'd been struggling to think of a topic. Her brain must have surrendered to exhaustion.'
Rose is very stressed, so much has happened and she does not know what to do. She feels that she has to do something to help the family. the family is poor and she is trying to graduate so she can help them.
Rose tries to hide how she really feels so others wont be upset, for example, when she is talking to Anna she tries to fake laugh so Anna doesnt know that she is missing her father also.
Rose is caring and helpful because she tries so hard to help the family out and her aunt even said that it must be hard on her.
Rose is quite mature for her age.
One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab is that she is willing to do anything for her family. She has many things going on in her life that she would like to spend more time on, such as writing her essay. The fact that she has to work at the restaurant and come home and help with supper shows that she is doing everything she can to help her family through their problems. Even if that does mean that she cant always do what she wants to.
She felt weighed down by what she was doing to help the family.  The detail is that she does not want to answer and tell her Aunt the truth because it might make her sad.
One trait that I found that could describe Rose is she is a kind person. One example of this is when Rose is talking to her aunt, and her aunt asks her if she feels weighed down by what you are doing to help this family. What Rose did not say should how she was a kind person. In paragraph 19 when she does not answer because she does not want to hurt her aunts feelings shows how Rose is a kind person.
Rose is very caring. She wants the best for her family and trys to look out and whatch over them. She thells her sister that they have to help there brother and look out for him so he can get a job and help support them.
Rose is a very hard working person. She is basically handling and adults job at a very young age. Rose had a job at a dinner, she went to school, and she took care of her sister.
hopeful, after talk with Aunt Kolab she felt lighter.
Rose and Aunt Kolab are both hard working. Kolab works late every day.
When Anna fell aslepp doing homework. She always seem tired and lonely. She doesn't like how her mom has to work late hours and she think that she shouldn't have to.
Based on Rose's conversation with Anna, Rose trusts her logic more than she trusts her emotions. Whereas Anna complains that she would rather Papa be home than making money in Los Angelos, Rose reasons although she misses Papa, the job in Los Angelos is better paying and they need the money for Paul to finish college.
One trait that describes Rose is that she is like a mother.  She is always thinking in advance about the future and what she can do for the family.
Rose likes to be looked at as a leader. She wants to show her sister a good example, not to be afraid or iratated.
One trait is that Rose is optimistic; she looks at things positively. Rose said 'We have our part to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.' Even though it's a rough situation, she's looking at what good can come out of it.
Rose is empathetic, and can understand what others are going through even when she is haveing a hard time. Example: She felt too young for so much responsibility. Then she shivered, imaginining how her brother must feel. Only three years older, he held the fate of two people-both his sisters- in his hands.
She cares a lot about her family, and she doesn't want to let anyone down. One Example in the story is she says ' I feel like I got a lot of responibilty and i have no idea what to do.'
Rose is a little bit selfish. When her sister came into the kitchen form just having a bad dream Rose didn't say anything but 'I fell asleep working on my essay.' instead of comfortig Anna.
Roes thinks that she's the only one trying to do good for the family, when she speaks with Anna, She has a tone about her that explains how she thinks she knows everything. But she also felt to young for all the responsibility that paul put on her, that's why she couldn't tell her aunt about her dream.
Rose is hardworking. She goes to school, then heads off to the resaurant she works at for her four-hour shift, heads home to help her Aunt make a quick super, and then she started on her homework.
Rose has a very devoloped sense of family. She didnt want to answer Aunt Kolab's question beacsue she thought it might hurt her aunt or her mother would be upset. She also decided to write her essay on the topic of Cambodian tradition and that same sense of family.
Anna feels like she needs to do her part in helping the family out but she feels like it is taking away from her life as in not having time to do what she wants such as writing her essay.
She's not used to the business of America. Like her aunt says, 'In Cambodia...what we're all doing would be quite normal...Now I realize that you're seeing the situation through other eyes-as you should, I suppose, because you grew up here'. Aunt Kolab means how Rose is more used to the way life went in Cambodia then the way life goes in America.
A trait that Rose has is caring about her family. She's not selfish at all. In the story Rose states that money isn't everything and even though she missed her father she understood that he had to go to Los Angeles for the money.
One trait that can describe Rose is hard-working. The author of the story says that she feels she needs to do her part to help Paul get through college. She is working to help him because she knows he will return the favor to both her and Anna.
I can tell that she is very open minded about things that she has to say!!And she doesnt have an attitude problem,and she loves her little sister!!
Rose seems like a person that is caring. She seems willing to help her family even though she is having a difficult time with everything going on. Just as it says she has an essay to write, work, school, and other things at home.
Confused, because she has an urge to talk about it with people to find out what to think of it.
She tries to hide the way she feels.  Rose does it by not telling her aunt how she feels when she asks if everything is ok.
Rosa is always busy she never has time to do anything. She always goes to school then she turns around and goes to work, when she is done there she goes home and helps her aunt cook a quick supper. She is a very busy girl, she hardly ever has time to do anything.
The conversation with her Aunt Kolab was good when the one with her sister, Anne, was not so good.
rose seems like she is not verry caring to anyone and i think this because of how she was rude to anna in their conversation
She sticks up for her Mom and Dad, in the story Rose and Anna started talking about their mom's job and how she works so late and how her dad had to leave for a job that payed almost three times as much and how she hated it but Rose stood up for them and said they had too.
One trait Rose has is that she is a hard worker. She has to work, go to school, and fine time to do homwork, but she gets is done.
When Rose is talking to Anna she tries to tell her sister how much she cares for Paul to get his education in college that way so that he can pay for her and Anna to go to college.
Rose is a caring person in the way that even though she feels strongly about a cause she doesn't want to concern the rest of the family with the matter so she keeps it to herself.
She is not rude. When she told her dream, she was not rude about it. She was more respectful.
'We have to do our part to do to help Paul finish college. then he'll get a job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
Rose is kind with her sister. She shows this by being compasionate with her sister when she wakes up in the middle of the night and she explains that dad left because the pay was three times what it is where they live.
Rose is a sympathetic person who does not want to hurt her relative's feelings. After Rose's aunt asks Rose if she feels overwhelmed with responsibilities, Rose does not answer because she does not want to hurt her aunt's feelings or her mother's feelings.
Anna gets angered really easily. An example of this would be while talking to Rose she tells Anna one thing and she storms off to her room.
Rose can be described as considerate because she is reluctant to tell her Aunt Kolab that she feels very weighed down by her familial obligations because she fears her aunt may be hurt..  The author writes, 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.  And probably her aunt would tell her mother.'
Resentful, she is trying to just push away her feelings by hiding how she really feels about her dad going away for his job.
It seems like to me, that she tries her hardest to make light of the situtaion with her and her sister. She made a joke about money, Anna said that money wasn't everything and Rose tried to make a joke and said 'only if you have everything'.
Rose is strong, she manages to comfort Anna instead of giving into the tiredness she feels.
She is responsible.  At least she feels responsible for everyone.  If she didn't she would have ignored Anna and got on her paper. But istead, she tried to comfort her and make her see the situation differently and that it will change.
Rose's charcter can best be decribed as stressed. She had to take on so much responibility for her families sake and she just can't take it. Like when she didn't say anything after her aunt asked her if she felt weighed down by her family, she didn't say anything because she didn't want to up set her aunt but she secretly wnated to say yes.
Rose is busy a lot, and does the best she can. I say that because of this quote: 'From school she'd gone staright to the restaurant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper.'
Rose is a overcaring person. She care for her family and want to help, however the story shows that she is far too concerned and feels as if she must support the entire family by herself.     It is proven to the reader that this is true when she has the nightmare. She envisions the weight of her brother unbearable and she strugles to survive. Ultimately she is drowned when she attempts to tell her brother to get off of her and  water enters her lungs. This suggests that she feels that she must help her brother get into college and her family get money, and that she feels guilty for her shortcomings.
Rose likes to caarry the weight of the world on her shoulders.
I think that Rose worries a lot and that she is afraid of hurting others, and that she is afraid to express her real feelings. It says that she was afraid to tell the truth because she thought she would hurt her aunt. Rose doesn't trust her voice because she doesn't want to say anything offensive and therefore, most of the coversation she had with her aunt she remained quiet. She seemed ashamed at even telling her aunt the dream but felt she had to so she wouldn't feel alone.
One trait that describes Rose would be fighter. She fights to keep a job, and go to school. She fights through being tired to help her aunt with her sister. She fights with knowing that her essay, and her dream to winning that award may not come true, becuase she loves her family enough to help out.
She dont care. When her sister Anna was talking to her she did not care what she was ssaying because she started on another subject.
Rose is an overachiver because she has to do so many things and yet she still participates in things. She had to do a flawless three-thousand-word essay, if she wins she gets to go to Sacramento to receive the prize. When she was talking to Aunt Kolab it is obvius that the Kolab knows what she is going through and that going on this trip will relax her but at the same time bulid up stress and anxiouty for when they get back.
Scared and troubled, if you ask me. I think she is scared to not able to support her brother are help him. She is troubled, because she is not seeing a way to help she just took it in her hands.
Rose is quite uncaring, considering how she ignores her sister and how she complains that she does too much work.
Rose is responsible because she goes to work making money to help her family out.  She does this while also keeping up with her school work and with urge to help her family.
She is understanding like she understands why papa has been gone
I would describe Rose as comforting. She tried her best to make her sister feel better and understand the situations taking place within the family when she woke up from a bad dream.

Rose is very compassionate and is always mindful of others. This is shown in her conversation with both her sister Anna and Aunt Kolab. When she talks with anna, Rose tries to make Anna feel better about the fact that their father can't be with them. When she talks with Aunt Kolab, Rose avoids telling her how she really feels, in the interest of keeping from hurting members of her family.
One trait that Rose claims is the fact that she does not wish to hurt her family members.  Although she is very stressed out, when her aunt asks, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family,' Rose does not answer because she does not want to hurt her aunt's feelings.
When she  talks to both of  them it seems  like she  does not want them to worry about her because in both of the  conversations she avoids telling them how she  truely  feels and whats wrong to keep them from worring.
Even though things are not going so well in the family, Rose tries to make the mood lighter by trying to laugh that sounded fake even to her.
Hopeful because when Anna mentions missing Papa, Rose assured her that they didn't need him and that if they were to help Paul finish college and get a good job, and then he could pay for them to go to college.
Rose is a very mature young woman. You can see this when she explains to her sister why her mom and dad do the things that they do to get money. It would be very easy for her to complain but she doesn't and this shows her maturity
Rose's family is always busy working. Her mother and father, and even herself after school for a four-hour shift.
When Rose talks to Anna,'Only if you already have everything,' she feels guilty.
One trait that describes rose is cautious, just because of the way she chose her words carefully in both conversations.
Rose is a very giving and thoughtful person. Rose is helping her family by getting an education and even though her aunt asked of she felt weighed down for what she was doing for her her family, Rose didnt tell her the truth on how she really felt.
I can see that Rose tries to be positive about life with her sister Anna. when she is telling her sister that they have to do their part so her brother can finish college and pay for Rose and Anna's college.
Rose is a very conflicted person. Although she loves her family, she feels resentful that she has to put so much time and effort toward trying to support them. For example, when she is trying to convince Anna that supporting Paul is important, she doesn't completely agree with what she is saying.....'she tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her'.
Rose is a hard worker and is trying to do her part to help her family. For example Rose states that Anna and her have to do their part to help Paul finish college.

In the conversation between Anna and Rose, Rose asked Anna what was wrong, but didn't really care for the response. She just went on to say how she fell asleep writing her essay. Anna then refers to her as acting like mom, which is a role she is trying to play since there mom works late.
Rose feels that she is being weighed down with all this responsibility of helping the family. She told her aunt about her dream and her aunt asked her if she felt weighed down by what she was doing for the family.
Roses trait would be that she is strong emotionaly. I know this because even when she is stressed and sleepy she helped her sister when she needed it.
One detail is that she is tried from work, school and homework and she has to get ans essay done for a state compition
I think one trait of Rose from the conversation with Anna makes her seem like she really likes her dad and wants him to be there but understands that he has to make more money for the family. I also think she is the one that is overwellmed with this essay and is stressed out.

Rose is a very caring person.
One way to descibe Rose would be scared, because she don't like fighting and argueing with her mom or her aunt.

She feels guilty for not wanting to help out. When her aunt asked Rose wether or not she felt weighed down by what she was doing to help their family, Rose didn't answer because she did feel weighted down, she just wanted to do what was right. By that particular converstation a reader can see that Rose is respectful and only wants to do whats right to help her family.

When her and her sister talk in the kitchen and get in a fight.
Rose seems hardworking and matierialistic in her conversation with Anna. She seems this way to me not only because she fell asleep working on her essay, but because she thinks it's okay for her Paul to move away from his family just because it is a better job that is better paying. While Ana believes family should come before work and money.
Rose cares deeply for her sister. Despite the hopelessness that she feels, she tries to make her sister Anna feel better about the situation when, in line 12, she says 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.' Despite her internal struggle, Rose pretends that things will work out to give her sister a sense of hope.
Based on this story, Rose's one trait that I can tell is that she feels like she has so much to live up to. Because, from the dream she had with her brother pushing her into the bottom of the ocean. And her conversation with her Aunt Kolab she seems stressed like she needs to take some pressure off herself.
Rose is optimistic. At the end of the story it says 'Suddenly, it occured to her: here was the topic for her essay, although it was still vague.' She never gave up on the essay even though she had stress in her life.

She is very sensitive when it comes to talking to her family members. 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.'
Rose is hopeful because of her conversation with Aunt Kolab.  Aunt Kolab offers to help Rose and tries to put herself in Rose's shoes.

This lifts some of the burden off of Rose an she starts to have a hopeful look towards life.

I think that she doesn't like to tell people about the way she actually feels because, she's afraid that it might hurt someone in the family or make them worried . When she was talking to her aunt she didn't mention her dream to her even though that's what she felt like she should do to make herself feel better.
One trait that Rose has, is that she is overwhelmed and kind of frightened. She thinks that she wants to tell Aunt Kolab about her dream because she thinks that it will relieve stress on her.
One trait that Rose posseses is that she is motherly.  While talking to Anna, she was talking about their Papa and how he had to take the job in Los Angeles because it paid good and the family needs the money.
Rose makes the best out of the situation and the detail is the her aunt was born in Cambodia and rose was not so Aunna had a hard time adjusting to the new scenery when she got here.
Rose is a caring girl who wishes to not hurt her aunt's feelings. In the conversation they had at the end of the story Rose's aunt asked her if she felt weighed by helping the family. Rose didn't answer the question because she felt she would hurt her aunts feelings.
Rose is helpful and you can tell this from the conversation she had with Anna. This is shown when Rose tells Anna that 'we have our part to do to help Paul finish college.'  Rose is younger and shouldn't have to take on a responsibility like that but she does to help out her family. She knows she can't have everything but still she is willing to help out her family as much as possible.
Rose gets ery stressed out from being busy, and from all the work she has too do. In the story it stated that she was very close to getting fired from her job. It also talked about how she wouldnt have time to find that she can use to squeeze in her essay.

Rose does what she needs to do then helps her aunt and holds a job all at the same time. That is very responsible to me. Also knowing she has a paper to do, but not enough time to do this paper. Rose does it anyways.
One trait is Hard Working. I believe she is hard working because most days she goes to school, then she goes to work a four hour shift, then she goes straight home to help make supper, and then she does her homework.
She cares about what she says to her aunt. In cambodia what they were doing would be quite normal.
1.Rose is caring because she is trying her best to help support Paul in college.
Rose is a very stressful person. She always has something on her mind and something that is always causing her to veer off her own path to help others.
Rose trys to act that every thing is ok when around her sister to make sure her sister dosent worry, for example when Rose realized she was over worked and had to finish her essay ,and Anna walked in and saw the look she had on her face and asked if everything was fine, and she replied that she just had a bad dream.
Rose can be descirbed as hopeful. She believes in her brother's abilities and she also is hopeful that her Papa did what was best for them, even if the situation upsets her.
I think Rose is Sincere to what she does, but when she has to work or has to do an 3000 word essay, she gets overwhelmed and doesn't know what to do
One trait that describes Rose based off some of her conversations would be that she misses her father alot. A detail from the story that would help support this is when she is talking to Anna and she says' I'm so lonesome for Papa. It seems like he's been gone for years.'
When she has something in her head, she's going to do it. She cares a lot about everything in her life.

She is hard working, and doesn't give up on anything easily. She is going to work after school and then is going home to help with the dinner.
When she was talking to Anna she seemed to be at a stump in her life and that trait that she doesn't have is confidence. Confidence that she knows she can get through it and make things better for herself. I think she is very busy with her life and doesn't have time for herself, or atleast doesn't make time for herself. It seems like she is missing some things in her life that she needs at that point in time. 'I'm so lonesome for Papa. It seems like he's been gone for years' (Paragraph 9)
That Anna is trying to put stuff in her schedule so she can get them done. But most the problems she is having is that she can't half of them done. So through out this whole story Anna is trying to found a way to do this.
One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab would be troubled. You know this because she feels weighed down, I know this because she agrees but doestnt tell Aunt Kolab about being weighed down.
Rose seems very overwhelmed. When she is talking to her sister, she gets very aggravated and storms out of the kitchen.
Rose is very loving because she works hard to try to help her brother get into a good college and would do anything for him, even if it ends up hurting herself.
Rose is fearful of letting her family down. Aunt Kolab saying 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?', shows how much Rose is afraid.
One trait that could describe Rose is that she has alot of flashbacks and emotional problems. Another that could also describe her is determinded because she wants to get this done and she stayes up all night trying to write this three-hundred word essay that she will say and she fell asleep writting it so i find that she is very determind about the situation and the essay that she must write.
Rose is overwhelmed because she feels like she has to do everything. Rose has to work at the restaurant for a four hour shift, then help her Aunt prepare a quick supper. Afterwards she has write her three thousand word essay.
Rose is a strong person. When Anna says she is lonesome for papa, Rose says it's only been four months, and he had to take that job in Los Angeles.
One trait that can desribe rose is that is is difficult, because Rose grew up here. Like when she said This must be difficult for you. Yes'
Rose is very hard working and caring.  She believes that when you help someone, they will help you in return.  When Rose is having a conversation with her sister, Anna, Rose states, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.  Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'       Rose is trying her hardest to pay for all of the expenses that her family has.  She is a very dedicated lady, who seems to find success in a lot of different situations throughout her life.
Rose is very stressed out from haveing to do so much, it says 'from school she'd gone straight to work for four hours, then home to help aunt kolab prepare a quick supper, and then do a three thousand word essay.'
Rose has taken on a adultlike responsibility. This is evident when Anna says to her, 'You sound just like mama.' This trait could be described as she was growing up too fast. she was not the typical teen that people would think of in the world. The best example of this is in the second paragraph where it talks about what her daily routine is like. This shows that she is busy with helping. This fact is shown when she talks to her aunt in the end when it talks about her being weighed down because she is helping her family.
Rose wants to help her family out because of the hard time they are going through. She is what you call it a 'people pleaser' and she wants to help out and win the essay contest to help out her family.
Rose is considerate. She is stressed out and feels like there is too much responsibility on her, but knows the family needs help. When Aunt Kolab asks her if she felt weighted down by helping the family, she doesn't respond because she wants to help, she just doesnt know how much she can.
Rose is a very hard working person she has many tasks to do in one day including, school, help around the hose, supper, work at the restaurant, homework, and her essay.
Rose feels overwhelmed with all of her responsibilites; however, she is very understanding about what she needs to do to help her family. She displays this understanding attribute when she cups her hands and thinks to herself that her brother's fate lies partly in her hands.
Resourceful, Suddenly, it occurred to her: here was the topic for her essay, although it was still vague.
I believe that Rose has traits like a mother would have. When she is talking to her sister, anna, Rose takes care of her. rose makes sure she is feeling ok and puts her to bed. when rose is talking to aunt kolab, it shows that she is under a lot of pressure because she has to be the mother figure for anna since their true mother is always out working.
Rose is a caring person because as soon as she saw her sister walking into the kitchen in the middle of the night, she immediately asked if anything was alright.
Guilty would describe Rose because in paragraph 19 Rose was afraid to tell Aunt Kolab because the dosen't want to hurt her aunt and she also thought that her aunt would tell her mother so Rose just kept it to herself.
Rose is a hard worker.  We do not know how old she is but by the description I would say she's in her teens.  Though at a young age, she works a four hour shift then has to go home and help her aunt make supper, and this is all before she has time to do her schoolwork.
Rose wants to please everybody. When she's talking to Anna she talks about how they have to do their job to help their brother, Paul finish college so he can get a good job.
She feels like a burden.' rose kept nodding. Maybe her life would get easier.Maybe it wouldn't'
Rose sounds very responsible. She has a lot of responsibilities and she is still concerned about school work and other important things in her life.
Rose can be described as overwhelmed. She is noted quite a few times through out the story as being overly busy.
She belives that money is everything. She feels that she and everyone else has to pay for her brother. Than, he will get a job and have to pay for his two siters to go to school.
Rose is very hardworking. This is demonstrated by the fact that she works a job in addition to her schoolwork, and also competes in other areas, like the essay-writing contest. Teh fact that she can manage all of those activities at all, even if they do leave her exhausted, is proof of her hardworking character.
There is one trait that can be picked up from the two conversations in the story. Rose wants to help her Mom and her Aunt but she has alot on her mind. For instance when she was talking about writting the essay and she said'when woud she have time to write a flawless three thousand word essay.'
She is willing to heklp her brother work his way to college. She tries her best to do what she can.
the anna told rose head jerked up from her chest.anna, what wrong? you feel okay. that what anna told rose.
Rose is angry. She has to work and school work at the same time and she just can't take it much longer.
Anna knows that no matter how stressful everything is on her, she needs to continue to reassure her sister and let her know that everything will be ok.  When Anna asks about their father, Rose says, 'It's only been four months, He had to go.  The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here.'
confused. I think she wonders why her father would choose to go so far away just for a job and she wonders why her aunt is doing what she's doing to help their family.
I do not know.
Rose seems to not talk a lot, she just nods when her aunt tells her something.
Rose is a very busy person.It said that her aunt' offer had somehow made her feel lighter. It made the weight on her shoulders lighten up a bit.
One way to describe Rose would be respectful, because through out the whole story Rose never talks back to Aunt Kolab.
One trait I can think of would be unsure of herself. She seems to be unsure if she can help out her family like the others. like she questions whether or not she is capable.She feels as though she would be a let down if she was not able to help out. One detail would be when her aunt ask her ' Do you feel so weighed down by waht you're doing to help this family?', she was unable to answer because she did not want to hurt her aunt.
I think that Rose is Open Minded. Because She could be like her sister and be bitter and angery but, even when she talks to her aunt and sister she still concidered about her family because her sister at the table is telling her there's no hope for their family.
With Rose having school, work, chores, and homework I would say that she is strong. Rose has a converstation with Anna talikng about their papa and even though Rose doesnt like the situation any better, she trys to stay positive.
In 'Crossing Over', the author displays Rose as a helpful child, but one who keeps her feelings inside. Although she feels pressured by what she needs to accomplish, she does not complain to others or stop doing what needs to be done. For example, as she was speaking to her sister, she explained how they needed to 'help Paul finish college...and he'll pay for [her] and [Anna] to go to college'(Paragraph 11, sentence 3-4). Not once does Rose express her worry about the situation.
As is widely known, people do not always show their true emotions, for a multitude of resons. Even though her feelings told her otherwise, during her conversation with Anna, Rose still gave her sister a rational explanation concerning their family's situation rather than be thoroughly honest. Then, when speaking to her aunt, Rose felt an apprehension about expressing her true feelings because she believed that perhaps she was being weighed down by her family obligations and that to admit it would hurt her family. What Rose has done, being able to set aside her emotions for a greater purpose, however difficult it is has shown that perseverence is a key part of her character.
Muted noises. Aunt Kolab making muted noises in the kitchen.
Lonely, 'Mama's not home yet, is she. I hate how late she has to work.'
One trait that can describe Rose is that she is jelous of Paul. An example is when she says, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a ggod job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
Rose doesn't want to tell her aunt how she really feels at first, because she doesn't want to hurt her or have her aunt tell her mother. so one trait would ne that she is mature.she takes care of her little sister while her mother works long nights.
Aunt Kolab cares about Anna and she knows when Something is wrong with her. 'Anna,' Rose said. 'What's wrong? You feel okay?'
From reading this story, I have come to find that Rose is a self-centered person. When young Anna came into the kitchen and told Rose that she had had a nightmare, Rose quickly changed the subject to herself by saying, 'I fell asleep working on an essay,' without giving a second thought to how her sister might be feeling.
The trait is that Rose kept an 'Open Mind' during the talks and ultimately found a topic for her essay, which pretty much worked out in the long run.
In both conversations they talk about being flustrated and weighed down with stress. Rosa feels she almost can't go on because of the fact her fathers gone and she's left to work. Rosa feels,' that she is too young for so much responsibility.'
Rose can be optimistic'Rose kept nodding. Maybe her life would get easier. Maybe it wouldnt.'
'Anna,' Rose said 'Whats wrong?' You feel okay?' It shows that she is caring
One trait that can describe rose based on her conversations with Anna or Aunt Kolab could be that she is a very family person she wishes to make people happy and try her best to keep the family togather.
Rose is a kind person and she seems to always be thinking about someone else. In her conversation with her little sister Anna, Rose feels overwelmed but she doesn't let her sister know and she even tries to compfort her. When Anna complains about their mother not being home and their father being away, Rose explains to her little sister why things are how they are in a gentle way. This shows compation and caring.
Rose was cautious. She didn't want to make a mistake that could result in someone being mad at her. One passage in the story that would support this conclusion is, 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.'
One trait Rose shows is caring. The reader can see this in the 19th  paragraph because Rose doesn't want to tell her Aunt Kolab what she really feels for fear of hurting her feelings.
Rose says Anna 'Sounds just like Mama' she trys to make things work with what they have.
I think that rose should've taken this a little bit more calmer, because the rest of them moved on and so did she.
Rose is a very busy young women.
Rose is very diligent. In the story she is talking to her sister when she tells her that she fell asleep while working on her essay. That shows that she was working hard enough to make her tired.
Rose is a very closed person, she doesn't say much until she really has to or is somewhat forced to.
Rose is very open sighted. She see's things through her eyes and through the eyes of others. One support for this is when she is talking to Aunt Kolab and her aunt says, 'But now I realize that you're seeing the situation through other eyes--as you should, I suppose, because you grew up here. . . . This must be difficut for you. Yes?' This quote shows how Rose's aunt didn't see through other eyes, and had to have Rose point it out to her. The eyes maybe of a different person or a different culture, but she was seeing differently.
Rose can be described as consoling.  In her conversation with Anna, Rose attempts to make sense of the family's load to Anna who is distraught and doesn't quite understand the whole situation.  She justifies their helping Paul with college, by telling her how he'll be able to pay for them  to go to college once he has a job.  Rose also tries to make a quick joke about money to lighten the mood.
Rose cares because in thestory of crossing over she trys to help with the money. but the three thounds-word essay was messing with her.
that she is always worried
One trait is caring. It can be seen when Rose was asks her sister, Anna Whats wrong. This shows she cares about whats upsetting her sister.
Rose, while feeling overwhelmed, tried to be optimistic in most situations. She feels like she has to be a role model for Anna. If Rose expresses her true feelings, then she is afraid that Anna will lose faith in their situation as well. In paragraph 11, Rose explains, with a maternal tone, how her and Anna have to appreciate what Paul is doing for them. He is going to school so he can get a job, and ultimately help pay for the sisters' college funds. Rose tries to point out the importance in helping out Paul. Rose would much rather talk about how she wants to give up, how she is tired of working so much, and how school is constantly weighing down on her. Despite these feelings, Rose tries to remain positive for Anna's sake, and holds her tongue.
Rosa coul be feeling a little hust at the dream she had. She told Anna that 'I'm fine, I just had another bad dream.'
In this story the character of Rose is in a tough situation. Her family is struggling to make money and this puts alot of pressure on her. As a result, when she is talking to her sister Anna you see you get a little angry. This is a result of the high amount of pressure that she is feeling. You can see this when she resonds to Anna saying 'Money isn't everthing' with 'Only if you already have everthing.' This is a rude resonse and is a result of the pressure Rose is feeling to not only finish her essay, but to also make money for her family.
Rose is a very smart person who thinks of things differently than others. This is shown in paragraphs 10 and 11 when Anna says that money isn't everything, and Rose says only if you already have everything. Most people wouldn't think of the situation in that way.
One trait that describes Rose is understanding.  When Anna says that 'It seems like he's (Papa) been gone for years' Rose understands it is for their good because ' The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he is making here.'
Rose is trying to be a rock for the family, she has to keep her head up for her little sister, and Paul. It shows when she tries to console her sister by saying 'He had to go.' when she says this she is using an excuse to make her sister feel better.
Rose is a thinker. She analyzes everything and will search for the meaning inside herself.
Rose is a very caring and respectful person. She does many things to help around the house. She does these chores before even doing her homework. She dreams that Paul jumps from a cliff and is weighing her down under the water. Paul in her dream refers to her caring and missing him since he has been gone for four months and him weighing her down refers to all the responsibility that she has at home.
That her mother is always late when getting home from work.
One trait that Rose has is the feeling of responsibility. She shows that when she is looking at her hands and says 'Paul's fate lies partly in these'
Rose is timid she shows this in both conversations were she either kept quiet or she didn't speak out very much at all.
One trait that describes Rose based on her conversation with Anna is that she is fearful because of the essay and helping her brother. A detail from the story is 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay fro you and me to go to college.'
Rose is very rational. She shows this trait in her conversation with Anna.  She tells Anna the reasoning behind her father's job, and she knows that they just need to do their part to get to a better life.
guilty 'Rosa didn't answer. if she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt and probably her aunt would tell her mother.
She wants to find something better for her aunt and whole family not just one person. Rose is not a selfish person which makes her trait outgoing.
From paragraph 19 I could tell that Rose is a very modest person. I got the feeling that she doesn't like to bother people. She even says 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.' Therefore she clearly does not want to burden anyone.
One trait that can describe Rose is that she is outgoin and is a hard worker even if she is trying to help out a nother family member.  'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'
Rose is always busy and doesnt feel like she should be doing all that she does at her age. The conversation with Aunt Kolab, she trys to come up with ideas to help Rose with everything she does.
Feeling the family is on her shoulders, as if she is the one holding everybody together. Paul's body sank down on top of Rose, pushing her to the sandy bottom. She was unable to breath because of the pressure she gets from her entire family.
She is very self-sufficient. While conversing with Aunt Kolab, she was very weary about letting her true feeling show. Aunt Kolab thought up the meaning of Rose's dream and asked if Rose felt that way. Of course Rose, not wanting any help or pity, avoided expressing her true emotions.
parragraph 22 sentence 1:maybe we can find a way to do things differentle.she wants to help and is a good person and try that everybody is happy.
One trait that Rose has is responsibility.  She takes care of all her problems and situations in the story.  After school everyday she goes straight to work then home to help Aunt Kolab prepare dinner.
One trait that describes Rose, based on her conversations with her family is that she is determined. She is exhausted and overwhlemed with all this stuff she is suppose to do, but yet is still determined to make it through because she knows she has to do this for her brother. Even though it isn't easy for her, she knows that in the end it will all pay off. Paul will return the favor by getting a job and putting his sisters through college. One detail from the story to support this is that Rose says, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college'
Rose is hopeful because during her conversation with Anna, she would say how when Paul gets a good job after college he would pay for her and Anna to go to college too.
Rose seems very caring and always think about others. She is so worried about helping her brother go to college.
Rose is a young girl having to squeeze in time for her school work while she has a job and also a younger sibling to take care of. Even though she had many things to do she still is caring for her family and is willing to do it all for them.
When Rose was having a conversation with Aunt Kolab, Rose showed how she can take on respondsiblities as a young women and not complain about  it. Rose took the trait of honesty and was able to confess to her Aunt that wasnt ready to take to on the responsiblities. Rose showed that she didnt want to let her aunt or family down.
One trait of Rose's that was shown in her coversation with Aunt Kolab hit me like a speeding bullet. Respect. Rose has respect for her aunt and her family. She knew the answer to Aunt Kolab's question, but felt that she would hurt her aunt so she decided it was better to say nothing than something wrong.
She was afaird, she was afaird to tell her aunt the truth.
Rose is brave in the sense that she doesn't want her sister to know how she really feels. Rose tries to be strong when she is talking to her sister and laughed a fake laugh. She didn't want her sister to worry about her so Rose was brave.
One trait that discribes Rose is loyalty.  Even with her hectic schedule, Rose is loyal to her family`s needs.  Rose finishes homework late at night so that she can squeeze in work at the restaurant.  Rose feels the weight of a busy schedule, but the extra restaurant work provides her family with some money that they sincerely need.
Rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream, to expose it so it would loosen its grip on her.
Through her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab one trait that shows in Rose is loyalness.  Even though Rose is weighed down by her school life, working, and trying to help out the family, she does all she can to try and get through a tough situation.
Even if I win, I won't get to travel to Sacramento to recieve the prize.
Anna is a very realistic person, and that is a good trait to have. She could easily be mad at her father for leaving her, but she realizes that their family needs the money, so she accepts why he left. Anna can see that her father is not leaving to get away but that he is leaving to help his family have a better life. She demonstraits this trait when she is talking to Rose and Anna says 'Only if you already have everything,' when talking about how important money is. Anna is realistic about how important money really is.
Rose is very dedicated. In the story it tells how she is overwhelmed with work and the essay she wants to write, but she still works so that she can support her brother Paul.
Rose is hardworking, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.'
That she hard working and does things she might not want to do just to help her family.
That she really cares about other poeples feelings and she showed when she asked her sister what was wrong.
ROSE DIDNT ANSWER
Rose did not want to hurt her family by telling her aunt that she felt weighed down by helping them so much. She did not answer her aunt's question because she knew that the truth would hurt her aunt and her mother.
I believe that one trait about Rose is how dedicated she is to helping her family. In the story she mentions that she goes straight to school, then to work, home to cook dinner with her aunt, then does homework for the rest of the night, so this obviously shows she is doing everything in her power to help her family make it.
One trait that I saw was that she acts different around different family members, for example, she was talking a bit more with her sister than she did with her aunt.
Rose seems like she would be dramatic as certain times. She said. 'I'm so lonesome for Papa. It seems like he's been gone for years.' When in reality he was gone for four months. Which is found in paragraph 9 sentence 1.
She is a very busy, and stressed out girl. An example to show is when she is trying to figure out how to fit in a 3,000 word essay, and work a 4 hour shift at the resturaunt.
Well it was that time in the kitchen that can desribe Rose how she stood and stalked out of the kitchen.
I think that Rose is mature. I think this because in the story she tries to help her sister with how she is feeling. Rose tries to help Anna out with the leaving of their father.
Based on the conversation between Rose and Anna, I believe that Rose is protective. In paragraph 11, Rose 'tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her.' It seems like Rose is trying to comfort Anna, without revealing what she truly feels. By covering up her feelings while speaking to Anna, I believe Rose is being protective and trying not to expose Anna to the way she really feels about her Papa's absence.
Rose is an independent person.  She can do things for herself.  She seems to like to appear tough to her family, like she has everything together, and she can get along just fine.  It seems that Rose does not want her family to know of her concerns for the trip she would to take or of her concerns for her brother and the rest of the family.  Rose is also caring deep down, and cares so much the weight of her caring weighs her down.     When Anna spoke to Rose about their brother Paul, Anna seems guarded.  She doesn't want to show her sister how she really feels about the conversation and her family's situation with her father and her brother.  Anna tells Rose that she sounds just like their mother because she talks of how they really needed the money for which their father was working.
Rose is very shy, but also likes to get what she wants. She likes things to be her way. In the story Aunt Kolab says 'Hmm. Maybe we can find a way to do things differently. A way better for you.'
Rose is very respectfull of her elders. When she was speaking with her Aunt Kolab about how she felt weighed down by the responsibilities put on her, 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.
Rose is a supportive sister. Rose holds back her emotions when she talks to her sister, Anna. Anna is upset about their father leaving and their mom being away for a while. Rose feels similarly about the burden of supporting their brother. She chooses to say that everything will work out to try and support her sister instead of letting her know her actual thoughts.
Stressful. When would she squeeze in writing a flawless three-thousand-word essay? 'I'm insane,' she said grimly as she gathered books and papers.
She wants to be succesful. She says when she is talking to Anna she says 'Only if you have everything.' And how she says about traveling to Sacramento to recieve a prize.
Rose is kind of quiet. She is helpful but doesn't really say anything. Like when Rose and Aunt Kolab were talking she just nodded and didn't say much.
She is very ambituos. 'From school she'd gone straight to the restraunt to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After that it was time for homework.'
Rose is compassionate towards others. 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.'
Rose seems very stressed and that everything is put on her, and she has to be the bigger person.
Rose is stressed out. She is in high school, and has to work everyday. She has too many things going on at one time. Her boss might fire her if she misses another day of work. She tries to stay positive, but it is really hard for her to because of the tremendous amount of stress on her.
When talking with her sister Anna, Rose acts very compassionately. Rose tries to act kindly towards Anna, and she does not want the younger girl to feel upset about the family's situation. After Rose admits that she misses Papa, Rose tries to rationalize the situation; she gently explains that he had to go to another job in order to support their family. By saying this, Rose attempts to make her sister feel less upset. Thus, Rose is quite compassionate.

Rose is a teenage girl who takes on a lot of responsibility. She is a student and is trying to write a three-thousand word essay on top of trying to fulfill her duty at her job.

Rose is a very hard worker and cares about her and her sisters education.     'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.'

shes caring because when she was talking with her aunt, she was being respectful and listened to what she had to say. She also aggreed with everything.
I think Rose cares a lot for her family. Rose comes home everyday 'to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper.'
In the story she felt she is too young to have this much responsibility for her family. In the story it says In the dark Rose clasped then cupped her hands. Paul's fate lies partly in these.
Very hopeful for good to come to her life. She is optimistic in that she wants everything to be better in her life and she tries to see that through Aunt Kolab and Anna. The hope with that she speaks of with Anna is that they must help Paul finish college so that he can send Rose and Anna to college. The hopefulness and optimism she she also sees in the speaking with Aunt Kolab. She finds what to write about in this speaking with Aunt Kolab.
She has respect for her Aunt Kolab because when she did not answer the question 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' She said she did not answer because she did not want to hurt her aunt.

In her talk with her Aunt Kolab, Rose feel that it's up to her to keep the family running and keep there hopes up, while supporting them money wise.  She feels over pressured in the situation.  Aunt Kolab offers her help to their family and take some pressure off of Rose.
'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'
Very thoughtful, Rose considers how others must feel when she is in the same situation as they were. An example is in paragraph 14, when Rose says 'she felt to youg for so much responsibility.' Now Rose was imaginaing how her brother must feel.
She is very responsible. She works at a restaurant after school then goes home to help make dinner.
Rose is a very two-faced person. In her conversation with Anna, she faked a laugh that she knew wasn't there. ('She tried a laugh that sounded fake even to her.') And for what reason? to simply get Anna to leave. Additionally, when she spoke with her Aunt Kolab, she did NOT tell her how she really felt because she knew that she would get mad.
That she is frustrated that everything is going on a once like she said in the story 'The day like most of her days, had been too long, too demanding. From school she had gone straight to the restaurant to work a four hour shift,then  straight home to help aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After that is was time to do homework.
When Rose is talking to Anna, she shows that she is selfless. This trait is shown when she says, 'We have to do our part to help Paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to college.' She is unselfish about working for her brother to finish school, even though she is exhasuted.
That she wants to be free.
The one trait I depicted from this passage was that Rose is grown up.  When Rose was talking to Anna, she said that 'we have to do our part to help Paul finish college.  Then he'll get a job and pay for you and me to go to college.' Next Anna stands up and says Rose sounds like mom.
I feel that Rose feels lonely cause her she feel she haven't seen her father in four months and her aunt said'Do you feel so weighted down by what your soing to help this family' Rose didnt answer then her aunt said somthing back to her. Rosie feel her life is dificult but she felt good because her aunt understodd how she felt.
Rose feels like everything happens for a reason. Anna doesn't quite feel the same way. Anna hates that her father is gone, and Rose seems to think it was all for the better. In the article she says, 'He had to go.'

A trait that Rose shows in her conversation with Aunt Koleb is caring. She begins the conversation with Anna by asking, 'Are you worried?' This shows how she cares about her sister. She also mentions to Anna how her father has to work hard to send Paul to college. Anna sincerely cares about Paul and her little sister, and wants to go to college herself.
Rose feels very overworked and when she talks to her Aunt Kolab she can't tell her the truth about how she feels taking on a big part of the house work so she lies. She gives off a very exhausting vibe about her extremely busy schedule.
I believe the story reveals that Rose is a caring person. The evidence behind my reasoning is when Rose said, 'We have to do our part to help Paul finish collge. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for our college.'. The reason I chose this part of the story is because I believe it shows a sympathy towards her sister, and by saying this to her it's allowing her sister to feel better about the situation. Rose would have to be a caring person to express sympathy to her sister.
One trait the Rose has in the story is that she never speaks up for wat she want to say. Like in the storyshe did not talk one bit to Aunt Kolab at all she only nodded.  Rose needs to say wats on her mind or her life will be pushed around.
Rose tends to feel uncomfortable with expressing her inner struggles. While talking to Anna, Anna tells her, 'You sound just like Mama,' illustrating that Rose covers her feelings by saying what she feels is expected of her.
Rose is quite humble; she didn't want to tell her aunt the wrong answer to her question, 'Do you feel weighed down by what you're doing to help the family?'. She just wanted a better life for her family in the United States now.
A trait Rose has is that she is understanding. 'Its only been four months,' Rose said as gently as she could. 'He had to go. The job in Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here.' This statement suggests that Rose is understanding of the situation and is willing to accept it.

One of Rose's traits is the she is resourceful. She needed a topic for her paper, and she was able to come up with one after talking to her aunt.

She did not want to tell her aunt the truth because she thought it would hurt her. Her aunt understands that things are rough and it is very difficult for her because she did not grow up in Cambodia.
Determined, she sticks to what is important to her. Like When She feel asleep working on her essay.
She is responsiable. She was nervouse because she didnt want to mess up her brothers chance to graduate from collage.
Rose feels conficted by how she believes that no one really understands what she is going through. One detail is in her dreams she sees all  the things that is going on and it frustrates her so much that she feels that she cannot do anything about it.
helpful ,paul fate lies in partly in these
One character trait that describes Rose is thoughtfulness.     'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.'
She tries to help her sister out cause their dad is gone but her sister is mad that their mom has to work so late and she isn't home yet. She can also help out her aunt Kolab with the things she needs so she has a helping trait.
Rose is stressed and scared. That is why she does not tell the truth to her aunt at first because she does not want to hurt her or her mother.
One trait of Rose is that she is a hard worker.  You can tell that she is a hard worker due to the fact that she has schooling, then has to work a four-hour shift, and after that has to come home to help with dinner and do her homework.  With all of what she does for her family she never gives up nore dose she ever take a break.
One trait that Rose has is responseability, and this is shown by the statement, 'Do you feel so weighted down by what you're doing to help the family?' This statement was made by Aunt Kolab in response to Rose's dream. This shows that Rose has felt the burden of responseability and is trying her best to maintain and finish through on what her family asks and what she wants to achieve.
Rose is a fearful or stressed being. She wants to help her famliy, however, she feels as if she does not have enough time or patience to do everthing. Rose feels pressured, and this trait of feeling pressured is exposed through a dream. 'His body sank as if it were made of stone, pushing her beneath him down to the sandy bottom.' Paul's body wrighting her down represents all of the tasks she needs to do. She has too much going on.
Rose is a sympathetic person. She does not like hurting other people. In paragraph 19 it says, 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.'
She is very down to earth and knows that her mom has to do what she has to do. When she says 'Money isn't everything.'
Anna rolled her eyes and shoved her chair away from the table.
Rose is a hard-worker and will do anything to keep her family up and running.  Thus when she defended what her family was doing to stay afloat to her sister she proved that she knows whats best for her family and will do anything to help them prove it.
One trait that best decribes Rose is that, she keeps to herself. Meaning that she holds her feelings inside and does not share with anyone. 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probab;y tell her mother.' This is and example from the story as to the trait I described.
She felt 'weighed down' or sad.
She is confused and busy with her life is right now. 'Rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream, to expose it so it would loosen its grip on her'.
This story shows that Rose is a mentally strong girl.  The story shows this trait in her when Rose says to Anna, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.'  This sentence shows that Rose is a mentally strong because eventhough she is younger that Paul, she still has to help him finish college.  Rose also has school, work, and family obligations that she has to take care of too.
I think that Rose is very caring and even though she is struggling herself, she worries about other people. I think this because when she was talking to Anna in the kitchen she says, 'Anna, What's wrong? Do you feel okay?' I think that really shows how much she cares for her sister even though she's worried about her essay, she takes the time to make sure her sisters okay.
I think Rose is very hardworking, cause she says. 'We have our part to do do help Paul finish for college.' I think it shows that Rose works hard even if she doesn't enjoy doing the work.
One trait that I think describes Rose is mature. I think this because when she was talking to her sister Anna she stood up for her father who moved to Los Angeles. She looks at things from other peoples' perspectives which makes her very mature.
mad
Rose is very tired and overworked.  From school she'd gne straight to the restaurant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper.  After that it was time to do homework.
1) I belive that Rose is an extremely comforting person because of the conversation that she had with Anna. She comforted Anna about her bad dream by talking with her and by making her a glass of orange juice.
She was talking to anna and said he had to go. Los Angeles paid three times what he was making here.'Anna glared at Rose. 'Money isn't everything.'That she was under stress and her mother was working late.
Rose is very close-minded. She's so used to things in America, that she didn't realize that what she's doing to help her family was also done in Cambodia, her family's native country.     Her aunt tells her 'in Cambodia, our first country, what we're all doing would be quite normal, but now I realize that you're seeing the situation through other eyes-- as you should, I suppose, because you grew up here.... This must be difficult for you. Yes?' to show that Rose is indeed weighted by her efforts to help her brother, Paul, graduate from college, and also to help her family in other ways as well, such as helping her Aunt Kolab with making supper and helping Anna cope with bad dreams.
That rose knows wgat is going on with her family
Rose wants to help the family as much as possible, but she does not want to up set her mother or aunt. In paragragh 19 she says if she told the truth she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.
She is a person who thinks bout every thing even if it is a old thought. like ther dream she had, how she remembered him jumpin off the rock and sank like a rock and had her pinned to the ground and didnt even realize it.
hard headed but open minded at the same time
Rose is a person who tries to please everyone. This trait is clearly shown when she does not answer her aunt when she asks Rose about feeling weighed down.
While talking to Anna, Rose, shows that she has a short temper when she rolls her eyes and then, 'She stood and stalked out of the kitchen.
When she is quiet, she seems self concious.
Rose come's off to be a an impatient person. Its not her sister's fault that she has to write such a long essay. She gets an attitude with her sister. 'Her voice sank to a fierce whisper.'
One trait is the fact that she doesn't want to hurt her family, no matter the reason, so she decides to lie. In paragraph 19 she puts this theory into effect.
Rose can be described by the the word caring. She shows this in her conversations with both her aunt and Anna. When she talks to both of them in the words she say she really seems to care. For example she says,'Whats wrong? You feel okay?'
Rose is very turthful sometimes. Also she keeps almost everything in. How she was turthful she told her aunt about her dream. Also she kept in about how she felt about the work load.
Rose is caring and doesn't like to upset others. When she was talking to her aunt it said 'Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.' which shows that she doesn't want to see her aunt get hurt.
I believe that Rose had the trait to endure. Not only does she endure her long hard days and make time to write her state qualifying essay. She also has the patients to endure even the negative moments that her sister often feels due to the situation they are in.
Rose doesn't think that her life will never get alittle easier. Unless her parents and her aunt had someway to make her feel lighter then always being busy. 'Camdodian tradition and snese of family, she realized, could survive an ocean corssing''.
She is a very caring person and she always wants to help out. she always try's to be nice.
Rose seems like she does alot to help her family, and it is hard on her because shes still young. She's a strong person, and would most likely do everything she could to help her family. Rose probably felt aot better after talking to her aunt, and now she feels like things might get easier.
Rose, the main character of this passage seems to be very grounded and down-to-earth. While many people may deem these as pessimistic characteristics, some value these as they are able to bear the hardcomings of reality when it comes time. An example of Rose's groundedness is during her conversation with her little sister. Instead of comforting Anna when she talked about missing thier father, Rose simply told her that it was neccessary for him to leave in order for them to send thier older brother to college.
Rose is open minded. The support is when aunt Kolab was making suggestions like sew for ladies, or even make special treats from their country and sell them, Rose was agreeable when she was nodding her head.
One trait Rose has is that she can make the best out of anything. Although she feels so weighed down by working to help out her brother, her Aunt helps to brighten her day, saying that maybe she could help Rose out. Not only did this make Rose feel better but she also used it as inspiration for her essay, and realized that her life really wasn't all that bad.
Rose is not very happy that her father had to go away for his job. When she wakes for her bad dream she goes to talk to Anna about how she feels. She says that she misses him and says money isn't everything because that's why he went to get more money for the family. Rose doesn't understand that so she is very upset about him leaving.
Rose is a very caring person. She would not tell her Aunt Kolab that she felt weighed down by her family because she did not want to hurt her aunt.
I think that Rose feels like she has alot of weight on her shoulders and kind of does not know what to do. Like in the story her Aunt said 'This must be difficult for you. Yes?' Rose nodded. that rite there is what tells me that Rose feels responsible..
She feels stressed, like she can't do what she wants to do. She feels as though she must do what is best for the family, therefore hiding the feelings that consume her chest. An example of this would be when she was talking about winning the prize for the eassy, but having to travel to sacramento. She said that she couldn't go because she'd missed too many shifts and she needed her job.
One trait that describes Rose is tired/ exhausted.' I feel asleep working on my essay' Rose said.
Anna feels sorry for her dad cause her mom works way to much.
* Its like she wants to keep her true feelings inside,and have her two family members thinking everything is okay. DETAIL FROM STORY:*Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.
To me, it sounds like Rose helps provide for her family, which tells that she is responsible. When she is talking to her Aunt Kolab, her aunt asks, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' That tells me, she helps her sister and brings in money from her job she spends so much time on, and doesnt have time for herself, such as the essay.
She worries too much about her future instead of what is happening to her right now. She talked to Anna about they had a part to do, so that they could go to college. Aunt Kolab also asked her if she felt weighed down by what she had to do. Rose said that she does worry about it.
she is lonely and dont like having her parents not around. because how she said, 'I hate how late she has to work' and also when she said im so lonesome for Papa'
One trait that can describe Rosa based on her converstions with Aunt Kolab is exausted because she has alot on her shoulders between working, school, and other activities such as the three thousand word essay for a competition.
Rose has identified her self as stressed. Durring both conversations, Rose seems to be hiding it. When Rose's aunt began speaking she noticed Rose's face. 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'
Based on the conversation rose had with anna, i would say that rose is this very sincere person who is just some what lost.the reason i say this is because when she is having this talk with anna she talks about how things are going to be ok for them when its timne for them to go to college because paul is going to help them just as her and anna are doing for him,but she doesnt really know if thats really true.
Rose is a loving, caring and very family orientated.
She is a hard worker. She always helps her aunt and mom out. She also makes sure her homework is done and wants to do an essay,
That their father left to make more money.
In the story Crossing Over, the character Rose is very hard working. When Rose is talking to her younger sister Anna she says that she fell asleep working on her essay. Another thing Rose says while talking to her sister is that we have to do our part to help Paul, the older brother, finish college. Later in the story she is talking to her aunt, and her aunt says to her do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family. These example show that Rose is a very hard worker.
She shows compasion whe she was talking to her Aunt Kolab. She knew she would hurt her feelins if she told the truth about her question, so she did not say anything.
She feels like she isn't ready to have someone else's fate in her hands.  when she talked to Aunt Kolab, she didn't talk, but she did agree that she felt weighted down by all the responsobility, and soon after was grateful that she had talked about it.
Rose worries alot.
I brlieve that Rose is sad. She is moping around. She is having nightmares. She feels like the wolrd is resting on her shoulders.
I believe strength describes Rose. She is trying to hold her family together and we see this during her conversation with Anna.
Rose is strong. Even though she has to work at the restaurant and go to school she tries to push forward for her family.
From reading the passage, one of Rose's traits would probably be confusion or exhaustion from the essay.
Rose is very stressed girl. She has so much to do in so little time. She has to do that paper and also put someone through school. Then have time to go to school herself.
Rose is lonely. She says, 'I'm so lonesome for Papa. It seems like he's been gone for years.'
Rose is a helpful, kind loving sister. This trait of love can be seen when Rose says 'we have our part to do to help Paul finish college'.This statement shows the maturity of Rose that she is willing to sacrafice in order to help her brother. By keeping her brother in school rose knows that he will someday help her through school which also shows that her priorities in life are set right and she wants to learn. Another example of this trait of maturity apears again when the author states that she goes from school to work and then stays up late into the night.
Rose is caring because she is a person that would do anything to help her family. When Anna discusses her distaste for their mother working so late and their father not being around, Rose attempts to lighten the situation and make Anna feel better. She makes a joke saying that money isn't everything as long as you already have everything. Rose also tries to explain why everything has to happen the way it does. An example of this is when she tells Anna that the only reason he left them was to make money for them to better their future.
She's caring by listening to her sister and trying to cheer her up, even though she failed at it, and also thinks about her aunt and her home country of Cambodia as something to write for her essay.
Sincere.    'Rose didn't answer.' 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.'
Rose is a very selfless. From school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four- hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper.
Rose is a quite girl. It saids that Rose didn't answer or she just nodded.
When Rose talks to her sister they do not get along and they argue about there family and money. Rose can't get Anna to understand that the family needs money and there dad moved away to make more money. When Rose talks to her Aunt she feels the same way as Rose does. They both understand that the family needs money. Her Aunt says that it was the same way in the other country. They both have the same trait just different arguments.
Rose is very humble. At first, Rose dislikes all the responsibility that is put on her. Then she realizes that Paul has the fate of two people in his hands. Rose only has to take care of herself for now. She appreciates the fact that Paul will care for her and her sister.
She has a way with finding topics for her essays...suddeenly, it all occured to her :here was the topic for her essay, although it was still vague.
Caring-she cares because she didn't want to answer her aunt truthfully whenever she knew that it would hurt her aunt's feelings.
Rose seems very caring. When her sister Anna wakes up and she is talking to Rose about how their dad had to go to Los Angeles for a job and Rose comforted Anna even though she was upset as well.
Rose cares about her family more than anything.
One trait that could easily describe rose would be that she is stressed and somewhat anxious about everything she is doing at the moment and what more she would have to do if her brother wasn't there. I think she feels like she has a lot of weight put on her because of all the other things her family members are doing. Her mom works late and so that must mean that Rose has to watch over her sister a lot which puts kind of a lot of stress on her because she also has to worry about other things going on in her life at the same time.
Rose is a lonely person.
Rose cares for her family, not wanting to answer her aunt so she would not hurt her aunt.  She also tried to calm her sister when she felt bad about her father being away.
Rose feels as if she has to work, work, work to help her family. It seems she can't enjoy herself or write her essay. In the story it says 'pushing her beneath him down to the sandy bottom', Rose feels trapped beneath the weight of what is expected of her.
One trait that can describe Rose is her driving need to succeed and help her family in any way she can. The fact that she is trying so hard to help her aunt and wanting to keep her little sisters spirits up.
One trait of Rose based on her conversations with Aunt Kolab is that she is tired of being so busy and would like some time to live. Rose said that she feels too young for so much responsibility. She told Aunt Kolab, and she understood. Seeing that she would see what she could do to take some stress off of Rose`s shoulders.
She wasn't really in to the conversation. She just kept nodding her head to show that she understood what her aunt was trying to say.
She is optimistic, she tells Anna that when Paul finnishes college he will help pay for her and her sister to go to college.
Rose is exhausted and hard working, but also quit. Aunt Kolab asked her if she felt weighted down, even though she does, she didn't admit that she did.
One trait that describes Rose is hopeful. Even though she has to work, go to school, cook, and try to write an essay, she still has hope that her life is going to get better. This is shown when Rose is talking to her Aunt Kolab. 'Maybe I can sew for ladies. Or I could make special treats from our country and sell them.' This sentence shows how she is going to make an effort to make her life better. She is also hopeful by coming up with an essay topic to write about and maybe should could win the writing contest.
Rose could be described as lazy because she doesn't want to work.
rose knows she has to get the essay done and ann i will ing to help
She is easily stressed out to the point where thinking clearlly is near impossible. The dream that she had was symbolic because Paul weighed her down just like stress weighed her thoughts. Also, Paul has recieved his diploma and so she may feel pressured to reach up at education just as he did but the essay unresolved burdens her mind.
Rose is very difiant in the story. It's almost like she is looking for attention. Rose felt an urgent need to relate the dream, to expose i5t so it would loosen the grip on her, After she had finished, her aunt said with a puzzled look, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'
Rose is a very understanding person. She understands that in order to live a life somewhere new, there will be changes that they all will have to make. She knows that they cannot all have everything they want, but in order to have somethings, they have to make some sacrifices.     While Rose is talking with Anna she explains to her that Their father getting a job in Los Angeles was something he had to do for their family. Although none of them like the fact their father is away so much, it is something they all have to learn to accept in order to have the life they want.
Rose is a very responsible person, because she tries to do all that she can to help out her family.  She tries to suppress how she is really feeling inside in order to avoid conflict.
Rose can be described as an unopen person for example in the story she doesnt explain or tell anyone the way she feels about the situation with her family and when she finally told her aunt about how she felt did everything change.
One trait that can describe Rose based on her conversation with Aunt Kolab is that she is a grateful person. When Aunt Kolab offered to sew for ladies or make special treats from their country to sell, Rose felt better. In Crossing Over, it says, 'But her aunt's offer had somehow made her feel lighter.' That signifies that Rose truely did appriciate what Aunt Kolab was willing to do to help her out.
Rose is responsibility, because She said, 'she felt too young for so much respnsibilt'.
One of Rose's main traits in the story is her selfless determination. When she says 'We have our part to do to help Paul pay for college...' she shows how helpful she is to her brother.
She is hardworking, because she balances schoolwork and works a 4-hour shift at her job.
Rose is shy. Rose shows this when she is talking to Anna. Rose does not say much, but finally looses patience with Anna. Also, when Rose talks to Aunt Kolab she does not say much either just keeping her thoughts to herself and nodding.
One trait to describe Rose would be optimistic. After Anna's bad dream, Rose tries to help Anna see their father moving away as a positive thing. Rose also attempts to help Anna look forward to the future when their older brother finishes college and gets a good job.
One quality to describe Rose based on her conversation with Anna would be she is responsible. Rose said, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.' She has a strong role in the family and she tries to explain their responsibility to her sister. Rose feels pressure from her duties to the family, but she knows the responsibility means more and comes first.
Rose is a very responsible and respectful person. In paragraph 2 she was responsible for supporting her family, working, and doing school work. Rose is very respectful to her Aunt Kolab because as it shows in paragraph 12 sshe does not want to hurt her.
Based on the conversation with Anna, you can tell Rose is sincere. She hid her true feelings in order to try to comfort her little sister.
Rose is careless of others.in her conversation with Anna she was talking as if money were everything, and she was rolling her eyes at Anna.Rose said they have to do their part and help Paul through college, so he will pay for them to go to college when it's their turn to go.
Rose is a independent teenaged girl with alot on her plate. From school she goes straight to her job at a resturant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help her Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After that it was time to do homework. She feels overlwhemlmed with the family's focus on her brother Paul. She don't want to wait on him to take care of her and their family, she wants to make moves on her own.
Rose is a responsible person.  She knows that she has a role in her family.  She does everything she needs to do to make her family's plan go smoothly.  She does things that most girls her age do not have to do because she is responsible for her brother going to college.  In a way, she is responsible for her future.  If she helps pay for her brother's college now, he will help pay for hers when it is time.  She never complains and is responsible for her role in the family.
In the passage Rose says, 'We have our part to do to help Paul finish college.'  She says this to her little sister Anna, as she explains to her the improtance of her parents work to make more money.  This statement by Rose expresses her work ethic.  It shows that she is hardworking and that it is important to her, as well as the rest of her family, to work hard to support one another.
I think that Rose is catious of other peoples feelings. She doesnt want to hurt her Aunts feelings by saying yes.'Do you feel weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose didnt answer. If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt.
Anna
Rose is selfish. In the story when Rose and Anna were talking Rose was saying how there Papa was away in Las Angelas for 4 months but she really didn't care cause the job payed better. Anna got upset and said money wasn't everything to her.
She feels like everything is hard for her, her essay, her job, moving from a different country, it would be hard for her. She feels suppressed from pauls achievements, because he has graduated from high school and is getting worried because her family doesn't have alot of money for school.
Rose
Rosa feels like her brother is bringing her down, she also feels like she is responsible for her brother in a way.  A part in the story is when she says 'Paul's fate lies partly in these' , she talking about her hands.  She is saying that she is going to have to work for him so they can have a good life.
Rose's trait in independence has been grounded down into nearly nothing. She doesn't believe she can make it to college on her own because she believes her brother holds the responsibility for that.
Rose is uptight.  This is apparent when she dreams of Paul smashing her and feels weighed down by what she's doing for the family.
Thoughtful. When Aunt Kolab asked, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?' Rose did not answer because she was being considerate and knew that it would hurt Aunt Kolab and her Mother's feelings if she had answered the question. Also, Rose was very gentle about expressing her opinions with Anna about her father working so far away.
Rose is loving and cares for her familybut she is scared and lonely. Rose is scared f being lonely and misses her family very much. Rose expresses her feelings of loneliness.
Rose had a essay to write and she was getting a additude with them all rolling her eyes throughing the chair and more. she wanted to stay with her aunt Kolab.and her aunts face lit up because she wanted her niece to stay with her and start over.
Rose understands why her father left because she is more mature than Anna and realistic about thier situation. I know this because when Anna says money isn't everything, she replies saying that it isn't if you already have everything.
ROSE IS DOUBTFUL, ESPECIALLY BY HER SARCASTIC REMARKS TOWARD,HER SISTER, ANNA SAYING,'ONLY IF YOU ALREADY HAVE EVERYTHING.'
Rose she has a lot on her plate. She has to work and go to school plus has to watch her sister Anna, Plus Rose seems to be a dreamer , she has a lot of bad dreams everything is hard for both her and Anna.
Rose is very considerate of her family when talking to Aunt Kolab. She shows this because even tho she feels overwhelmed working to take care of her famliy she doesn't not want to say anything that may hurt her aunt.
One trait that describes Rose based on her conversation with Aunt Kolab is that she is extremely conscience of other peoples feelings. I think this because when her aunt asked her if she really felt so weighed down Rose hesitated a lot before telling her aunt the truth because she didn't want to hurt her.
Rose seems to be reserved. She's more to herself, she won't talk about her feelings to others. At the end of the story, Aunt Kolab was asking Rose about how she felt about the family. She asked, 'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family.' Rose didn't answer to her Aunt Kolab she just simply nodded.
Thoughtful because, she wanted to hide how weighed down she felt because she didnt want to hurt her mother.
They both like helping people
Rose is very dedicated to what she does. She has school, homework, and a four-hour shift and still finds time to write a 3 thousand word essay.
Rose puts her family before herself. This can be seen when she is talking to Anna and insists that they must work hard to put their brother through college.
A TRAIT THAT ROSE HAS IS THE ABILITY TO SUPPRESS HER PROBLEMS AND TO REASSURE OTHERS.
She is very stressed. When Rose talks to Anna about working on the essay so hard that she fell asleep doing it.
In the conversations that Rose has with Anna and Aunt Kolab Rose comes off as determined. She is determined to graduate just like her brother, Paul, did. She's determined to help her family out as much as possible with her father gone in Los Angeles.
She is a very busy person in the story.  She is constantlydoing something to help, wether it be school or family.  'From school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to hel Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper.  After that it was time to do homework.' (Paragraph 2).
Rose knows she wants something else but the sense of family she feels is stronger.
She is caring and wants to be as kind as possible. An example was when the story said, 'It's only been four months,' Rose said as gently as she could.' She was obviously trying to be nice to her sister.
A trait that Rose showed when she was talking to Anna was that she can be sarcastic. She shows that when Anna said 'Money isn't everything' and Rose responded with 'Only if you already have everything'.
Rose is caring, when her aunt asks if she feels weighted down by her responsibility to her family. Does not tell her that she is. She does this to save her aunt's and mother's feeling so they are not dissapointed in her.
Rose is upset because her mother is always working. She feels that it is her job to watch out for her sister and little brother.
She is stressed out alot and she cant write her essay. 'When would she squeeze in writing a flawless three-thousand-word essay?'
One trait that Rose possesses is that she is very caring for other people. She is very stressed concerning her family's situation, yet she still manages to keep going. Her talks with Aunt Kolab helped show her that she can take her situation and make use of what she has. Thus, she finds a topic for her essay, making her feel better.
One trait that describes Rose would be stressed. In the story she has to work at a resturant, help her aunt with supper, and do homework. The story also tells me that she would have to 'squeeze' in writing a paper. Telling me that she is pushed for time. Showing that she is stressed.
Determined because she just knows that Paul will finish college and make enough money so that both of the girls will also be able to go to college.  Even though Anna doesn't think that this will happen Rose knows it will happen.
Rosa told her Aunt Kolab about the dream she had and how she felt about it. Her aunt understood completly and trird to help Rose and talk to her about the situation and decided to try little activities to help Rose not feel this way.
I would describe Anna as a very hard worker. She goes to school on a daily basis, after school she then works a four hour shift at a restaurant. When she gets off work Anna rushes home to help her Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper, and then she does her homework. Anna has to juggle school, work and a demanding home life at a young age which in my eyes makes her a hard worker.
I think Rose's most outstanding trait is her sense of sympathy. Rose seems like a young girl with too much responsibility. But instead of going into how hard her life is, she notes on how much harder Paul's life was. This also shows a good deal of selflessness and respect for others.
What is only one trait that can describe Rose based on her conversations with Anna and Aunt Kolab? The one and only trait that i think could describe Rose is motivation. I think that this word would describe her the best beacuse she always thinks of other ways to do things. In paragraph 22 line 1'Hmm. Maybe we can find a way to do things differntly.....' I also think that this shows her character is a very driven person.
One trait Rose has in this passage was that she said that ''Money isn't everthing'' meaning that no matter how thing turned out they where going to be ok till Papa gets back from his job in Los Angeles.
One of the traits that Rose has based on her conversation with her Aunt Kalob, she's someone that would do anything for anyone just to make thinngs right, and go better. An example of this is that she goes to school, and has a job right after school, leaving her not enough time to do anything she really wants to do for herself. But she wants ans needs to help her family out.
A trait that I believe would describe Rose best would be persistant. Even though she has to work a job, help around the house, and has the pressure on her to go to college, she still goes on with life and does the best she can. During her conversation with Anna, Rose tries to cheer her up and help her understand that they are doing better than they would have been doing in Cambodia. But Rose also hides how she really feels, and even though she does not like the weight she must carry, she still moves on. During her conversation with Aunt Kolab, Rose also sees the brighter side of things in how her Aunt can sell things to help the family out and makes things a little easier for Rose.
One trait of Rose would be that she is hard working. This i so because in the conversation with aunt kolab, she has all these thing to do. It's like she is carrying around the whole family on her shoulder that everything i sup to her. Although she is still young, she still works as hard as she can to do the best for her family, and thats deffeniatly a hard worker.
Rose felt that she did a lot for the family. She felt too stressed. Rose did a lot. she balanced having a job, school, helping take care of her sister and family.  She felt weighed down also.  An example of this was when rose's aunt asked her if she felt weighed down by all she did for her family.  Rose did not answer her because she didn't want her family to feel bad. she thought that her aunt would also tell her mother.  She didnt want anyone to feel bad or get mad at her for anything.  Even at the end of the story Rose's aunt understood where she was coming from and made suggestions to help Rose's stress level.
-she was sincere, one way this is shown in the story is, 'If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt'.
Rose has a sense of humor. She says, 'Only if you already have everything,' to express this humor although she does not feel like the happiness behind it is real.
She is very protective of her family. She wants to fix everything and make sure everything works out. She has a strong sense of duty. You can see this by how she goes straight from school, to work a long shift, to help her aunt make dinner.
Rose can be described as selfless. She puts the needs of her family first. She risks her school work and even a state competition by working to help support her family. Her Aunt Kolab hints at it when she asks Rose if she feels weighed down by what she has to do for the family but Rose doesnt respond.
One trait that I can see in Rose is that she is the kind of person who worries about everything like when her and Anna were talking about how little time she had to do things because she had to work and that she had missed a lot of shifts and her supervisor was already about to fire her so she wouldn't be able to travel to Sacramento if she won the essay prize.
Rose can quickly see the better things that can come out of the situations she is living in. This shows that Rose has a good attitude on life and when she is down she can become happy very quickly.
I think Rose is very caring.  It seems like she is doing everything she can to help her family, even though it can be very stressful at times.  I think she loves her family very much and would never stop helping them just because she is feeling overwhelmed.
She is considerate. Paragraph 19- Rose didn't answer. If she told the truth, she would  hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.
Shes a caring person.
Rose doesn't want to hurt anyone's feelings by saying how she feels.  She didn't want to hurt her sister or her aunt. In the story, it says; Rose didn't answer.  If she told the truth, she would hurt her aunt. And probably her aunt would tell her mother.
Rose seems like she is a caring and providing member in their family. The storys states that she has a job, tries hard in school, and tries to help her sister as much as she can. It seems the father will be gone for a long period of time, as will the brother one for work and the other for school. So it seems Rose may have to step up and help out.
thinks she knows everything.she ignores anna.
Rose has this trait that seems to show that she keeps her problems to herself to stop her family from worrying about her instead of working to help her brother finish college. Rose shows this when she stops by her mothers bedroom and finds her mom asleep. This shows that Rose would have told her about the dream had her mother been awake, but her mother was not awake to help so Rose continued to keep to herself.
Rose cares very deeply about others. She tries to comfort others and would do anything for them. In her conversation with Anna, Rose sees that her younger sister is upset. Rose tries to comfort Anna and tells her that even though things are tough now, they will get better.
She is hard working,' From school she'd gone straight to the restaurant to work a four-hour shift, then straight home to help Aunt Kolab prepare a quick supper. After that it waws time to do homework.'
Rose is dedicated to her family.  This is proven by her conversation with Anna when she says that she and her father have to work for Paul to go through school.  Also, Rose's dream reflects that she feels the burden of this dedication when she describes that she thinks she is drowning.  All of this evidence supports the idea that Rose is dedicated to helping out her family even though sometimes it can be difficult.
One trait that Rose has that stands out his her love for her family. She is angered by the thought of her dad being gone for four months just to earn more money. This is evident when she says, 'Money isn't everything.' She knows that her dad is trying to get the best for his children, but she would rather have him around. She understands that family is more important than having more money to spend.
Rose displays an outward optimism in her conversation with her younger sister Anna. She really understands Anna's resentment and frustration as her dream reveals, but she replies to Anna with answers that predict a bright future for her and Anna saying, 'Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for you and me to go to colloge.'
One trait that describes Rose based on her conversation with Anna or Aunt Kolab is that she is understanding.  She is willing to listen to others' advice, such as the advice she got from her Aunt Kolab.  She is also willing to give advice, such as the advice she gave to her sister, Anna.  She is not hard-headed.  She is willing to take others' advice and look at the situation from their point of view.
Rose thought she is to young to have all the responsability that she has to take care of. and is streed by it all and she still has to wright aflawless three-thousand-wors essay
one trait of Rose is that she hides her feelings after she has that dream when she is tlaking to Aunt Kolab.  'Do you feel so weighed down by what you're doing to help this family?'Rose doesn't answer and Aunt Kolab knows the answer is yes, because she goes to 'school, works, comes home to help the family out and then does her homework.'
Rose is a strong person. She wants to be a rock for her sister. She tries to do her best to keep the family going.  When Anna is complaining about her Father, Rose soothes her being as gentle as possible.  Even though Rose has a lot going on, she does her best to act as a leader for the rest of the family.
Rose hides her emotions for the sake of others. She shows how selfless she is when she does not answer her aunt's question in paragraph 19 (sentence 1).
Rose seems to be very responsible. She had a job to be on time for, school work to get done, and she had to help her Aunt Kolab with house chores.
Rose is very helpfull, which is a lovely trait to have. She offers ideas to her aunt to make things better ,like sewing or making treats!
happy cause she trys to cheer her sister up.          depending on her aunt for support.
she is scared and dont know what to do, she feels alone. She wishes her dad was still at home.
That she is a hardworker.
A person that trying to be sucsecfule and dowhat her eldors tell her to do.
A trait that Rose haswould be hope. We can see this trait when she is talking to her sister Anna and she says, 'We have our part to do to help paul finish college. Then he'll get a good job, Anna, and he'll pay for us to go to college.' In this part of the story you can shee that she understands what she has to do so that hopefully Paul will help her get to college just like she did for him.
She is from Cambodia. 'In Cambodia, our first country, what we're all doing would be quite normal.'
I think that Rose stands her grounds. She is very real about what she says and I think she really means it. She also has her own opinion on things, but she is very caring and I think she really loves her sister.
Rose is very responsible. She is involved with school, work, household chores, and is also trying to be in a writing contest. Somehow she still manages everything pretty well.
Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a track star but he could not read. 'No school wanted a runner who couldn't read.' Paul listened to Mr. Leonard about his past and realized that is was similiar to his present. Paul decided that because Mr. Leonard had helped him with track that he needed to help Mr. Leonard out with his reading. 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard, it's time to start your training.'
The background information about Mr. Leonard relates to paul because they both couldnt read very good and mr. Leonard wants paul to to do better in life then what he did. it effects paul by making him want to try hard in track and school.
It motivated him, He knew what Mr. leonard meant and that gave him incintive to try harder.
The information that Paul gets about Mr.Leonard was that he was the hall monitor when Paul stared middle school.He tells  Paul that he wanted him to come to the gym at 2:30 so paul did and he remeber that Mr.Leonard did the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals and broke the record, but he lost he scholarship and flunked out because he couldn't read.So Paul wanted to do the hurdles for Mr.Leonard to make him feel like hes not a nobody and a somebody.
The information has an effect on Paul because Paul and Mr. Leonard both have the same problem with reading. Mr. Leonard was helping Paul excel at something, so now Paul wanted to help Mr. Leonard. That's how the background information had an effect on both Paul and Mr. Leonard.
As Paul learns more about Mr. Leonard, he is able to see just how much alike the two of them really are. An example would be, Paul cannot read and neither can Mr. Leonard. When he was in college, Mr. Leonard was a star hurdler as a freshman; Paul is starting out to have potential to be a great hurdler. The last statement provides evidence on how similar the two men are. Paul can  sympathsize with Mr. Leonard because they are both not very good at something.
The effect on Paul about Mr. Leonard was that it don't matter how smart you have to play sports, but it's best that you still care for your school!
It shows that even if you cant read, just like Mr. Leonard, it dosent mean that you should stop trying in life. Just like when he went to college but lost his scholarship because he couldn't read, that didnt stop him from breaking records on the field. So it just showed Paul that he shouldn't give up just because something gets hard in life.
He relates to Mr. Leonard. So feels bad for him.
He starts to realize that Mr. Leonard is trying to teach him a life lesson on never giving up because he was a good athelete and ended up not being able to run because he couldn't read. He then realized he needed to learn to read and try his best to achieve his own greatness.
When Paul recieved the background information on Mr. Leonard he saw a connection between them. That is why later in the story they decid to start training together, and since they both struggle with reading they can be better friends in understand what they are going through.
Mr. Leonard isnt a good reader and so he tells paul he broke records in college but he couldnt read that good so it helped paul understand that it is good to learn how to read and over come obsticables
In knowing Mr. Leonard's background information, Paul feels like the two can relate now. After Mr. Leonard tells Paul about his inability to read, Paul states 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.' This statement supports the fact that Paul feels empathy for Mr. Leonard because the two of them have experienced the same struggle in school.
The background information that the reader recieves about Mr. Leonard is that he was a track star through high school and his freshman year in college, but that he didn't know how to read. His grades were terrible and he flunked out of college despite being an incredible runner, it didn't help him academically. One of the best runners in history who broke records had more in common with Paul than he could have ever imagined. Paragraph 45 states, 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well-feeling of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew. This man had given his time to help me excel at something. Suddenly I realized what I could for him.' Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard also cannot read but took his time out of his day to teach Paul how to excel at something that he did know how to do, and knew how to do it very well. Paul returns this favor to the best of his ability by trying to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read. Paragraph 46 says, 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard, I said, walking back toward the school. It's time to start your training.'
The backrground information that Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard has a good effect on him.  When he finds out that Mr. Leonard was a good athlete, but did not finish college it gave Paul hope.  He realized why Mr. Leonard was so interested in helping him better himself.  Mr. Leonard helped Paul excel, and feel like he was worth something.  So Paul felt as if he had to give a favor in return.  So he began teaching Mr. Leonard how to read.
He is excited because he will learn how to and be good at a sport
Paul thinks that if he got to know Mr. Leonard then maybe they would have something in common with him.
The effect the backround information has on Paul is it shows him a whole nother side to Mr. Leonard. It showed him that they were much more alike them he origanally thought.' The emotion in Mr. Leonard's words were all to familiar to me. I knew them well-feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew. This man had given his time to help me excel at something. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.' After he learns this about Mr. Leonard he realizes he should do something for him in return. ''C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' I said, walking back twoard school. 'It's time to sstart your training.''
The background information that Paul gets about Mr. Leonard shocks him. He sees that Mr. Leonard was an amazing hurdler, and he didn't even tell him about it. Paul asks 'Why didn't you tell me about this?' and he got an unexpected answer.
He lost his scholarship and flunked out.No ather schools wanted a runner who couldnt read.He wasnt a good student.And that he had no learning senters in his school.
The backgroung information made a similar emotional feeling come back to his mind.  This feeling was the way he felt when he was in fromt of other students and wasn't sure of an answer or couldn't read a passage.  'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me,' supports the my opinion that Paul knows how Mr. Leonard feels.  The effect of Mr. Leonard's background information made Paul choose to help Mr. Leonard in reading, just as he had helped Paul overcome the obstacle of jumpin hurdles.  This is shown in this passage from the story, 'This man had given his time to help me excel at something.  Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.'
The effection the data has on Paul is a lot. Paul thinks it is amazing that Mr. Leonard has done so much with his sports career.
When Paul gets some background information on Mr. Leonard he finds out that he won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. He also found out that he broke records. When Paul confronted Mr. Leonard about it Mr. Leonard told him that school was hard for him and he flunked out of college because he couldn't read. Paul remembered that he can read and that he can help him. So that is just what he does about it.
Mr. Leonard has poor reading skills and therfore had to drop out of college. He was an amazing athlete who lost his scholarchip. paul became an amazing athlete  who can't read as well. In paragraphs 4-10 he gets stopped by Mr. Leonard and then trains more and improves during paragraphs 22-26. Paul and Mr.Leonard both have poor reading skills but are great athletes.
The information Paul finds about Mr. Leonard on the website is surprising to him.  He found out that Mr. Leonard also had, and still does, trouble reading.  Mr. Leonard was a great hurdler in college and flunked out of school because he could not read.       Paul finds this to be surprising.  He feels empowered to help Mr. Leonard to learn how to read, since Mr. Leonard has helped him learn to jump hurdles and get pass obstacles, like not being able to read very well or at all.
It shows Paul that Mr. Leonard has gone through alot of the same obstacles that Paul has in life.  He emotionally talks about how he had gone to college on a track and field scholarship but flunked out because he couldn't read, and that really affected Paul because he knew that feeling all too well. Paul was having to go to a learning center to read so he knew exactly what Mr. Leonard went through.
At first Paul felt a little big left out because in paragraph 35, he said 'Why didn't you tell me about this?'. After some of the story is revealed, Paul became curious and pressed on in paragraph 40 'Well, what happened after that?'. Then finally in paragraph 46, when the full story is told, Paul felt bad for Mr.Leonard because the two people are very alike.
The backgound information that PAul had gotten effect him because Mr.Lenard couldn't read just like him so they both help out each other to learn something new.
The effect of the background information had a great effect on Paul. Paul might have felt as though he is being trained by one of the best hurdlers he knows of. Paul was also appauled by the information he wanted to know why Mr. Leonard stopped doing track and why did he want to trained Paul.
Paul is surprised by what he finds out about Mr. Leonard. He was kind of shocked and excited about the achivements that he had made.
Mr. Leonard was a very good track runner. He broke lots of records while he ran the hurdles. He was a poor reader and lost all his scholarships and flunked out of college. He now works as a hall monitor. Paul is going to help Mr. Leonard read and Mr. Leonard is going to help Paul run track.
Learning about Mr. Leonard's background information gives Paul a feeling of empathy and thankfulness for his trainer. Paul empathizes with Mr. Leonard because he understands the embarrassment Mr. Leonard feels due to his inability to read since he himself has gone through the same experience. Paul also feels very thankful for the time and effort Mr. Leonard has given to help him.  He shows this thankfulness with his desire to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read.
He was kind of a good kid gones bad.
hes a good guy
it makes him think vwerry different about Mr. leonerd because he was not the guy he was thought out to be.
He was a good athlete but he wasnt such a good student. Mr.Leonard relied on his friends to help him get by. He related to him because he was embarrased when he got called to read aloud. It doesnt really effect the back ground so much
Mr. Leonard was ashamed although he did well in his athletics he wasnt a good student . and he wanted Paul to know that you cant get by easy without knowing you work. He wanted Paul to focus on learning but at the wsame time become a better athlete. Mr. Leonard tell Paul how and what he did and college, and that was depend on others to help him get by.
Mr. Leonard try to be good person and he want to go to collage but Mr.Leonard felt embarrassment.
The background information helps Paul relate to Mr. Leonard. Neither of them can read and they are both good at sports.
After Paul finds out the background information on Mr.Leonard he is curious on why he is still not an athlete. He is also curious on why he didnt finish college. But just like Paul Mr. Leonard can not read. Paul can feel the emotions that Mr. Leonard is feeling. Paul knew them well because he knew what it felt like to be called upon to read aloud or when he didnt know the answer like everyone else. Just like Mr.Leonard help Paul training in becoming a great fast runner, Paul is taking Mr.Leonard to the center learning center.
When someone gets background information on someone else, they learn alot more about that person. In the story, Paul is informed background information on Mr. Leonard. As it is discovered, the information is actually similar to what Paul has a problem with. Mr. Leonard couldn't read and flunked out of college cause his lack of ability to read. Although Mr. Leonard wasn't a very good reader, he was a very good runner. When Paul explains that he can't read, Mr. Leonard wants Paul to run track like Mr. Leonard did in high school. He wanted Paul to run so he could excel at something like Mr. Leonard did. They both had the same feelings of embarrassment for their lack of ability to read.
The effect it had on paul was to want to help Mr. Leonard with his reading ability.'Soon I realized what I could do for him.'C'mon,Mr. Leonared,'I said, walking back toward school.'It's time to start your training.'
During the story, Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was an athlete who didn't go far due to his poor reading skills. This information, made Paul feel more comfortable because he became aware that Mr. Leonard had the same problem that he has. They're both good athletes who have trouble reading.
They find alot out about eachother more and more while Mr.Leaonard is training Paul.
Mr. Leonard couldn't read either and he's trying to say that everyone has obsticals they have to overcome in life. Reading is one of the things Mr. Leonard needed to overcome but he didn't overcome it while he was in college that's why he flunked out. No school wanted a runner that couldn't read so he never went back.
When Paul found out about Mr. Leonard's background it was all to familiar to Paul. Paul said in the story that he knew the emotions in Mr. Leonard's words to well, feelings of embarrassment when called to read aloud, or when he didn't know an answer everyone else did know.
I think that when Paul gets the background information on Mr. Leonard he is inspired to be just like him. Paul says 'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. You broke records.' this shows that Paul is enthused about the fact that the person who taught him to do this is a professional in his eyes.
The effect it has on paul, is to motivating. Paul learned that Mr. Leonard was a great track runner in college. Paul is motivated because Mr. Leonard had the same problems Paul is sturggling with.
The background information that was given in the story has an effect on Paul because Mr.Leonard sees himself in Paul. Mr.Leonard could not read in school, but was very good at track. He feels that Paul is going through the same thing. Paul feels that he can relate to Mr.Leonard. Now Mr.Leonard is going to try and help Paul complete what he could not.
When Paul found out background information about Mr. Leonard, he seemed very suprised. He had no idea that Mr. Leonard was a good athelete or that he had reading trouble before. When he found out about this information, he was very empethetic. He said 'It's time to start your training.' in support for him.
It shows that Paul will have a good coach to teach him how to do the hurdles. when Mr. Leonard is telling him to pump his arms and lean Paul will know that Mr. Leonard will know what he is talking about.
Paul knew nothing about Mr. Leonard before he started having conversations with him. The most Paul knew about him, was that Mr. Leonard was the hall monitor, and that most of the other students obeyed him on a regular basis. When the coach gave Paul the URL and told him to do some research on Mr. Leonard, it had a great effect on him when he did it. He realized that this man was just trying to help him to overcome a 'hurdle' in his life and that he meant well. Mr. Leonard did this, hoping that Paul wouldnt get stuck in the same position he did and that Paul could overcome it while he still had a chance, and the ability to do so.
The information made paul want to become a better athlete and reader. 'feelings of embarrassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didnt know an answer everyone else knew.'(line 46-48) This shows how Paul could relate to Mr. Leonard after he told about his past.
Mr. Leonard was talking to paul about when he use to be really good in sports until he lost everything; but paul new it was over.So Mr. Leonard is goin to help hem turn his life around so he can make a change not just doing good in sports but in school to.
The affect that Mr.Leonards story has on Paul is that, it shows him he can do something if he sets his mind to it, and he is trying to show him that he wants him to succed.
He finds out that Mr. Leonard is actually a track star, and he also can't read very well. In some ways they are very much alike, because Paul can't read very well either, but he is trained to be a great athlete. By finding out more about Mr. Leonard, Paul is able to compare himself to him in a 'role model' sort of way. Maybe with Mr. Leonard's help Paul will be inclined and encouraged to try and succeed in ways that Mr. Leonard couldn't.
Paul felt like him and Mr leonard had stuff in common not knowing to read. He felt like he had to try his best and fulfill Mr. leonards tasks. Because when Mr. Leonard was in school he had the same problems as Paul and didnt make it cause he couldn't read like he did. So he was going to prove some people wrong and help Paul out in hurdle.
He was suprised that Mr. Leonard was a track star in college and that even though he was a teacher he flunked ou of college.
When Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a talented track star he is suprised and confused.  Then it is clear why Mr. Leonard took interest in Paul, and that is because he can relate to him.  Paul realizes this and connects them with a bond.  This bond is that neither of them can read well, and when Paul sees this, he decides to act, instead of being told what to do.
Mr.Leonard had gone through the same thing as paul only he went throughhigh school then colege not knowing how to read then he finally flunked out of college and no other college wanted someone that couldnt read. paul was trying to learn how to read and now he had a reasoon to keep going and not give up.
Paul was effected because he has a problem reading just like Mr. Leonard, Which is why Paul was going to the learning center at the begining of the story. Paul didn't want to not learn how to read.
Paul understood that working hard in school is still important even though it gets hard. The background information also shows Paul that he is almost like Mr. Leonard because he is becoming better at track and has trouble reading.
The background information about Mr. Leonard has a good effect on Paul. It shows Paul that he is not alone with his reading problem. Also, that Mr. Leonard was a great runner but without education Mr. Leonard did not become sussccefull in life. It shows Paul that he has to work hard in every aspect of life. Paul learns to be kind and help someone that helped him. Like, at the end after learning Mr. Leonard's past and how he can't read. Paul offters to train him and help him read.
Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a poor reader just as Paul is. Paul now feels like he can accomplish great things if he works hard at them. Then, at the end he returns him a favor by helping Mr. Leonard become a better reader.
He feels lied to.
why do i have to take this test
Paul seemed shocked that Mr. Leonard never told him that he was an awesome runner. But was shocked to find out that Mr. Leonard never could read. I feel like Paul feels better knowing that Mr. Leonard couldn't read either, and that he wants to help Mr. Leonard out by teaching him how to read better. Just like Mr. Leonard did by helping him get on the track team. I think Paul found out at a good time, because I feel like that if Paul knew that from the beginning he would never actually try to learn to run with Mr. Leonard.
The information the coach provides Paul with enlightens and motivates him to make a better future for himself, and to make Mr. Leonard proud. Even though he is a weak reader, Paul finds that he is good at hurdles, something he and Mr. Leonard have in common. After Mr. Leonard shares his story, Paul is motivated to become a better reader, as well as to help Mr. Leonard to do so as well.
he is surprised that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college. He was suspicious, so he decide to ask Mr. Leonard. When he did, he found out that Mr. Leonard couldn't read.
Its makes Paul wonder why Mr. Leonard quit running track and college, and when he asked Mr. Leonard why, Mr. Leonard said it was because he couldn't read that good. Also it helped Paul realize what kind of person Mr. Leonard use to be. Like a good athlete a good person but not the smartest.
The background information helps Paul understand why Mr. Leonard wanted to teach him how to jump hurdles and let him pass in the hallway when going to the learning center. Paul also now understands why Mr. Leonard didn't talk about his past and was so adamant to teaching Paul how to jump hurdles.
When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonards past, it changes his view of Mr. Leonard. He realizes that the two of them are more alike than he ever would have imagined. He even says that he knew Mr. Leonard's feelings too well, talking about the embarrassment of not being able to read. He also decides that it's his turn to help Mr. Leonard out, after everything that he's done for him. As it turns out, Mr. Leonard and Paul are two peas in a pod, and it changes Paul's view once he realizes it.
when a coach hides something from you feel suspcious and want get in on the action. when he hid that secret about him quitting track because of his grades shocked the narrator.
Mr. Leonard couldn't read and he wanted to make something of himself, just like Paul. Paul was getting tired of getting chose last for teams and not achieving, so he went ahead with Mr. Leonard's advise. Paul soon found out that Mr. Leonard was just like him and Paul wanted to achieve for Mr. Leonard.
The effects it has on Paul is to keep working hard, in school and out. No matter how good you are at the sport, you have to do well in school also. Paul took that advice, and started getting tutored and practicing on the track.
Paul finds out background information about Mr. Leonard when the high school track coach gave him a URL for a track and field website. This encouraged paul, because he could relate to Mr. Leonard. He also realized that he was dedicating his time to help Paul excel at something.
When Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals, he is suprised that Mr. Leonard had made such an achievement in his past. In return to Mr. Leonard helping him, Paul now wants to help Mr. Leonard learn to read since this is the reason he flunked out of college.
When Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard had been an excellent runner in track, he is somewhat confused because, as the story says, Mr. Leonard is now only a hall monitor. He wonders what had happened that caused him to drop so low in the order of things. After he talks to Mr. Leonard though, he realizes that it is just as important to have a good education as it is to be good at sports. It inspires him to accel in all areas of his life, not just sports or school.
I think it made Paul more motivated. I say that because Paul says ' this man had given his time to help me excel at something'. I think that made Paul feel special.
Paul finds out that Mr. leonard is a poorp reader just like himself and I think Mr. leonard flunking out of college will push Paul to do better in reading.
The background information Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard makes him work harded at hurdles. Paul think's it is weird that Mr. Leonard flunked out of school.
In this story about a kid named Paul who wants to be accepted but cannot read a teacher mr. leonard wants to help Paul do better in literature and he wants paul  to try and do track. Paul is a natural at the hurdles and soon hes about to join the track team. After school leonard tells paul his tragic story about how he used to be a successful hurdler untill his rejection due to grades and gpa.
The information about Mr. Leonard motivates the narrator and it also makes the narrator feel more connected with Mr. leonard knowing they went trough the same thing.
The narrator is shocked at how good of an athlete he was, and did not tell anybody. Then the narrator realized that Mr. Leonard did not tell the whole story about how he could not read, and was struggling in college.
Readers can see that the backround information on Mr.Leonard makes Paul realize that he needs to keep up with his grades as well. Mr.Leonards story may help Paul realize that it doesn't matter if you're the best at the sport, because he also has to keep up good grades to get into a college for the sport he's very good at. So the effect Mr.leonard has with his backround information could be considered inspiration.
He is greatful that Mr. Leonard had told him his background story, because it helped him along the way with his sport. He Is glad that he told him so that he knew how he could help him to through out the way.

When Paul find out about Mr. Leonard he is shocked, yet he feels the same as Mr. Leonard. Paul listens to Mr. Leonard speak about his past, and realizes that Mr. Leonard's words are all too familiar. Paul too understood what it felt like to be embarrased. This inspires Paul to help Mr. Leonard with his obstacle.

Paul understood Mr. Leonard's situation of not knowing how to read. Paul felt the realization that Mr. Leonard helped him excel at something, which made Paul feel good about himself.
After Paul learns about Mr. Leonard's past he feels that he can better relate to Mr. Leonard because they are both inable to read. Knowing that Mr. Leonard had flunked out of college even though he was a major 400 meter sprinter really let Paul understand the seriousness of working hard and learning to be all that you could be. He learned that he had to be determined no matter how discouraging the lack of reading skills truly is.

During the story when Paul gets background infromation about Mr. Leonard, he gains a new respect for the teacher and becomes a closer friend.  This can be seen in the text because in the last two paragraphs it is impied that Paul would help Mr. Leonard learn to read.
That Mr. Leonard Grabowski and Paul are alike in many ways.  They were both wanted to be in track but they couldn't becuse they were not good enough so everybody thought. So Then Mr. Leonard was the best 400 meter runner. So that made Paul want to be just like him.
That Mr. Leonard can't read just like Paul. Paul looks up to him because Mr.Leonard went threw what hes going threw right now. That he had a hard time in college.
He feels like he knew exactly where Mr. Leonard was coming from. He also didn't know how to read and was becoming a great athlete. He is also empathetic towards Mr. Leonard. At the end of the story Paul tells Mr. Leonard 'It's time to start your training.', indicating that he is going to help Mr. Leonard learn to read.
Well, Paul is doing really poor in school and Mr. Leonard was good at sports and bad at school to so he wants to make sure that Paul has at least something that he is good at so he shows him about track.
The effect that the background information has on Paul is that it causes him to wonder why Mr. Grabowski never continued his career as a runner. He wanted to know more because he asks, 'Well, what happened after that?'
The background information being good or bad gives paul the motivation to do as well as he could. It also encourages him and is a great example of leadership being said is exactly what a leader should tell someone who they look to encourage or motivate.

paul said that all of mr. Leonards words were all to familiar to him and he knows how he feels
There is a lot of effect of Mr. Leonard's background information. One effect is that Paul did not feel as bad about not being able to read because Mr. Leonard was not very smart either. Once Paul found out that Mr. Leonard was a former college track star, he knew he was in good hands. Paul knew that what Mr. Leonard was teaching him was correct.
At first, Paul is curious, wondering why Mr. Leonard was acting solemnly, and then comes to realize why from Mr. Leonard's story. As Paul listens, he feels familiar emotions coming from Mr. Leonard, emotions Paul himself feels when he is in certain situations. As Mr. Leonard finishes, Paul indirectly offers to help Mr. Leonard with learning to read better.
He understands why he was helping him out with the hurdles. It was like his obstacle in school when he didn't know how to read, but his friends helped him out through school and the learning center for Paul was like Mr. Leonards friends. But once he got to college his friends weren't there to help him out anymore. Mr. Leonard wants Paul to go onto college and make records and do what he wanted to do when he was in colloege but couldn't because he couldn't read and thats what made him drop out.
Paul is proud that the man who has been coaching him is a great athlete himself but wonders why he never ran after his freshman year. He then wants to coach Mr. Leonard in reading like Mr. Leonard coached him in track.
they bothe was good at track but neither of them was good readers and, Mr. Leonard didnt want to see Paul drop or get kicked out of Collegwe like he did.
Paul knew exactly how Mr. Leonard felt about not knowing how to read. Paul felt the embarrassment he felt when he had read aloud infront of the class, or having to answer questions he didn't know the answer too.
Mr. Leonard's background effects Paul because it realizes that he he is a lot like his self.  Mr. Leonard had reading problems when he was around Pauls age and he was usually picked last for sports.  That is when he found hurdles.
It motivates him because they relate so much.
This information gives Paul a whole new view of Mr. Leonard. He sees a new man every time he looks at him because he never saw the track star in their school's hall monitor in the past. Now he sees something totally new, a new insight to Mr. Leonard's ideology, a new perspective from the man who got him started doing hurdles. The narrator's shock flows out of him when he asks Mr. Leonard why he didn't tell him about his past. Then when Mr. Leonard explains why he dropped out of school, Paul is bewildered, but this gives him a new drive to do well in the learning center. This also gives him the idea of getting Mr. Leonard some help with the learning center. The information about his past spurs all of the reader's actions in the sequence of events that make up the falling action and resolution.
Paul was a nervous person and he wanted to make his teacher and coach happy if he runs through the hurdles to get past the obsticles not just on the track but also about life too. He wanted get away from his fears so that he can move on with his personal life.
He knows where Leonard is coming from because he isnt that good of a student either. He then wants to help Leonard because he had helped him with track.I found this out from the last two paragraphs of the story.
At first, Paul only thinks of Mr. Leonard as a hall monitor who checks his pass twice a week. Then, Mr. Leonard helps him seek an extracurricular activity, he is interested in and Paul doesn't quite understand why he is helping. After talking to the track coach, looks up Mr. Leonard on the internet, and talks to him about his past experience with track and learning, he then understands what he is trying to do for him. Mr. Leonard was in the same position as Paul and understand how he feels when it comes to school. So, he tries to find something that Paul will succeed in to help him build his confidence. After, Mr. Leonars helps him, Paul feels as if he should give back and help Mr. Leonard in return.
Paul is concerned that Mr. Leonard didn't tell Paul about his track career before. When he asks Mr. Leonard about it he finds that Mr. Leonard can't read either. He sees that even though Mr. Leonard can't read he still had a great accomplishement. This gives Paul hope that he can be good at something too.
Paul was shocked that he broke records.he was supprised that Mr.leonard did that.He also learned that he went to colledge but didn't stay in
makes him feel like he knows the person better since they have all that information about him.
Mr. Leonard was a good athlete but not a good student, not because he didn't try but because he couldn't read very well. Paul and Mr. Leonard are similiar because they are both good at hurdles but they had trouble reading. 'The college scouts told me that my grades didn't matter, that I'd have tutors to help me, but college work is a whole lot harder than high school work. I lost my scholarship and flunked out.' He wanted Paul to be a good reader so that if he gets a scholarship for hurdles than he wouldn't lose it because of his grades.
It helps moviate him to become a better reader and to try to help someone less forturnate.
Paul was always the last one picked in gym. He then background checked Mr.Leonard and found that he was a track sta.That inspired him to get fit and to enjoy gym even to strive to be the first picked in gym. He also was wondering why Mr.Leonard didnt tell him about his past tack star statis and soon after the confrontation Mr.Leonard was inspired to re live his past as a track star.
Paul realized Mr. Leonard was like him in many ways.  He realized that although he couldn't read either, Mr. Leonard suceeded in a way.  Paul has the oppurtunity to do something Mr. Leonard couldn't, be a good athlete and learn to read.  Mr. Leonard didn't have learning centers, Paul realized how blessed he really was.
Mr. Leonard was just like Paul at his age. He could not read. But then Mr. Leonard does what his former coaches did for him, and Paul taught Mr. Leonard how to read.
The effect that background information Mr. Leonard has on Paul is that hes not very good at sports and is choosen last for teams. Mr. Leonard has also found out that Paul is not a very strong reader and goes to the Learning Center to get help on that.
When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonards past he is very thankful for the help on the track. He now knows that even though he cannot read as welll as some others, he is still very fast and can be one of the best thanks to Mr. Leonard's help.
The background information that pauls recieves about Mr.Leonard has an effect on paul because it lets him know he can do anything he put his mind to even if he has weak points.
Mr.Leonard  backround information affects Paul because it show paul if you work hard you can reach you goals. It also show how people can help other people. Mr.Leonard backround show his difficalty in reading just like Paul. Paul even states'The emotion in Mr.Leonard's words were all to familiar to me.'
After Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard used to be a great track star is surprised that Mr. Leonard never told him about running in college.  When Mr. Leonard explains to Paul that he could not read and flunked out of college Paul knows how Mr. Leonard felt because he could not read at the beginning of the story.  After Paul hears Mr. Leonard tell him about his reading troubles he takes Mr. Leonard to the learning center to help him for once learn how to accomplish something.
He was kind of concerened why Mr. Leonard never mentioned that he was a great runner that broke records.
The background information about Mr. Leonard are that Mr. Leonard broke records when he was a freshmen in college that won the 4oo meter hurdles at the nationals. He was not that good in school and only went to college cause he was a good athlete so he flunked out and didnt gradute. They didnt have learning places back then.
It affected Paul because Mr.Leonard's story was almost the same as his and he could relate to the feelings of Mr. Leonard. Like being called on to answer a question and not knowing it.
After Paul finds out the background information about Mr. Leonard, he realizes that he is in the same position as Mr. Leonard.  The teacher could not read when he was in high school either and did not get the best grades and he could not read.  Paul realizes that if he keeps working in the learning center and gets better at reading, and when he gets really good at track he could be in the same place Mr. Leonard was but farther.  Paul realizes that him and his coach could become very close because he is in the same position as Mr. Leonard was when he was his age and the coach wants to help him achieve and go very far.
Mr. Leoanrd's background taught Paul a valuable lesson on doing well academically and in sports. For example, Mr. Leonard words were familiar to Paul and they were feelings of embarrassment.
The effect the background information about Mr. Leonard is encouraging to Paul. Paul knows how it feels to not be able to read so he wants to help Mr. Leonard.  At the end of the story he walks back to the school telling Mr. Leonard that it's time to start his training. The background information of Mr. Leonard encourages Paul to help the hall monitor out.
Paul is a younger version of Mr. Leonard when he was a high school student. He saw that Mr. Leonard achieved by training for the hurdles, but he didn't have enough courage to learn to read. He wanted to become something in life like Mr. Leonard and after the information he found out he decided that school work was very important. He also decided that Mr. Leonard did him a favor, so he will teach him how to read in return.
Mr. Leonard's story has a powerful effect on Paul.  It helps him realize that he is not alone in his struggles.  Many people have gone through what he is going through.  They had a lot in common.  Paul knew the feelings and emotions that come from a reading disability.  Paul is actually lucky.  When Mr. Leonard was in school, they didn't have learning centers to help people read.  Paul has been presented with an opportunity that he never received.      Paul looks at what he has been given and the time and effort Mr. Leonard has put into him and decides that he should give something back.  He takes Mr. Leonard to the school for some 'training' in reading.
It makes him surprised and made him wonder why he wasn't still doing hurtles until he found out from Mr. Leonard that he couldn't read. The narrator was very impressed especially with him winning the 400 meter hurtles at the nationals and the fact that he broke records.
When paul gets background information about Mr. Leonard he was very surprized also he wondered what happend to him. He understude him because Paul also was not good in school.
he finds out about his colledge track succes and wants to be like him.
It has an effect on Paul becuse it sounds just like him. Paul cant read very well at all. He gets help which Mr. Leonard did not really have the chnce to get help from teachers only students. Paul want to exel in school and track. He wanted to over come his obsticals. The hurdels repersent the obsticals in life and Paul could over come them if he just trye. Paul is trying his very beast to become the beast on the team and at school.
It makes Paul realize why Mr. Leonard wanted him to meet him in the gym at 2:30. It explains why Mr. Leonard cares anything at all about Paul, because he is a school hall monitor.
paul is always getting picked last and so was leonard. they both cant read so they are just alike. and now they are both really good at jumping hurdles.
The effect that the background information had on Paul was shock.  He was suprised to find out that this man that was coaching him was a track star.  Paul was also confused.  He wondered why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him this.  Paul asked 'Why didn't you tell me about this?'  Paul couldn't believe it.  That is why I think Paul was both shocked and confused.
When Paul learns that Mr. Leonard's track career ended because of receiving poor grades, Paul felt sorry for him. He knew Mr. Leonard was a nice man and had gone out of his way to help him, so Paul automatically wanted to return the favor by helping Mr. Leonard in his struggles as well. Paul relates to Mr. Leonard in the way that he knows what its like to be one of the ones who doesn't get good grades, and being embarassed about the fact of not being able to read near as well as others. Paul immediately realizes all that Mr. Leonard has helped him accomplish, and he wants to help Mr. Leonard accomplish something of his own.
Paul thinks he cna over come anything ads long as he can stick with it and practice. At first Paul was not a very good runner. Then Mr. Lenord told him to bring sneakers and shorts the next day. Whne Paul got serious about running and put his mind to running the he would do very good at running. So if Paul can Practice and be good at running he will not be picked last any more for sports and will do good at his favorite sport.
The background information that Paul received about Mr. Leonard helped him to realize why Mr. Leonard had been helping him to excel at running. Paul felt a connection with Mr. Leonard, and wanted to do whatever he could to help Mr. Leonard achieve his goals in return for Mr. Leonard helping Paul to learn how to run. This is evident in the story in paragraph 45, where Paul narrated, 'This man had given his time to help me excel at something. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.' Paul also said in paragraph 45 that 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me...feelings of embarrassment...' Paul was now able to empathize with Mr. Leonard just as Mr. Leonard empathized with him, and an even stronger friendship between them was formed.
When Paul gets background information in Mr. Leonard, he sees that, just like Paul, he struggled with reading and was also a runner.  Paul foreshadowed Mr. Leonard's story growing up through high school and college.
Paul was empithetic because he to knew how Mr. Leonard was feeling. 'I knew them well-feelings of embaressment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't konw an answer everyone else knew.'
Learning about Mr. Leonard's past helps Paul in many ways. When he realizes that Mr. Leonard was a successfull hurdeler, he feels proud and surprised that Mr. Leonard would take the time to help Paul succeed. When Paul discovers about Mr. Leonard's struggle to learn, Paul feels a connection with him. He understands how Mr. Lownard felt and after hearing his story, he knows that he wants to do well in school. Before he didn't realize how much not being able to read could effect your future. Learning Mr. Leonard's background information helped Paul be even more determined to succeed.
The background information had a positive effect on Paul, it gave him the motivation to overcome the hurdles he was going through.Even tho Mr.Leonard wasn't the stongest student he was able to compete athleticly.It helped connect the two.
The effect it has on Paul is suprised. He was working with somone who was really good at what he was teaching this kid. Paul was excited that he has someone to relate to and he might become sombody.
The information that Paul recieves from the website the track coach gave him made paul realize something. When Mr. Leonard asked Paul about the learning center Mr. Leonard let paul go after he told him he couldnt read. Now the information that Paul got effected him by making him realize that since he cat read it doesnt mean that he cant be good at other things like sports. Because after Paul gave the information printout to Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard told him that since he couldnt read he had to quite track because he couldnt read and because of his grades in school. And after he was told that Paul realized that Mr. Leonard was just like him in the sense that they both couldnt read and that since Mr. Leonard helped him Paul has to help Mr. leonard learn to read.
After learing this background information, Paul realizes why Mr. Leonard is just like him.
Paul would have almost the same background as him, except pauls would be about high school.
Paul realizes that it is not just him that has problems. Anyone can over come the problems that one might have in life, and still better themselves.
The background information about Mr. Leonard has an effect on Paul that made him realize that he could help Mr. Leonard in the same way he helped him. At the end of the story he understood him more after and went on to help him.
He relixes that he was a great at the hurdels. Soon Paul relizes that Mr. Leonard was a Track and Feild star back in collage and continues to let him coach to get ready to try out for the team. As Paul confronts Mr Leonard about his past, at first he seems sadened by it. 'I was a good athlete,' 'but not a good student. We had no learning centers in our school. I relied onfriends to help me get by, but even then the work was always too hard.'     'But you went to collage,' Paul said     'Things were different back then,' Mr. Leonard replied. 'The collage scouts told me that my grades didn't matter, that I'd have tutors to help me, but college work ia a whole lot harder than high school work. I lost my scholarship and flunked out. No other school wanted a runner who couldn't read.'     'C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' Paul said, walking back toward school. 'It's time to start your training.'
Paul knows how Mr. Leonard feels, he also has a difficulty reading and he understands how it feels to be embarrased about the lack of reading skills. This brings him closer to Mr. Leonard because he starts to realize they are alike in many ways other than running.
Paul was surprised and when he confronted Mr. Leonard about it wanted to know why he had quit. He pressed for the answer by asking 'Well, what happened after that?'. Mr. Leonard explained that he had been a good runner but had struggled with the school work and lost his scholarship, causing him to flunk our of college. Paul felt he could relate to Mr. Leonard about the familiar feeling at not doing well at school and realized what he could do for him. Telling him 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' as they walked back towards the school. 'It's time to start your training.'. So now they have both learned something from eachother, one was how to work hard and become good at a sport, and then teach one how to read better.
Paul is effected by Mr. Leonard's background information because Mr. Leonard can't read just like Paul and Mr. Leonard could have been a huge track star if he would have focused on his school work in high school. Paul is motivated to work harder on his work at school now because he wants to be somebody.
Paul was worried about his reading dissabilities. Mr. Leonard was pushing paul to be good at track, becuase Mr. Leonard knew that paul would have a better chance then he ever would at succeeding in track and in studies.
Mr. Leonard used to be a good track star, but ended up dropping out because he couldn't read. When Mr. Leonard finds out Paul can't read he helps him get better at hurdles. Then since Mr. Leonard helped Paul get better at something, Paul helps Mr. Leonard get better at something he was bad at.
Paul is effected by Mr. Leonard's beackground information because it is the same thing he is going through, And Paul feels empathetic towards Mr. Leonard.
The background information Paul gets on Mr. Leonard effents him because he finds out he is being taught by a former great. This boosts his confidence on becoming an athelete and makes Paul want to achieve goals.      When Paul learns Mr. Leonard flunked out it motivates him to try to get better as a student because without the grades, he would never make it in college. He also wants to return the favor by teaching Mr. Leonard how to read.
The background information has a effect because he didn't know that he was in track and it would have been easier for Paul to say something to him if he knew about it.
Paul is used to obeying Mr. Leonard. He does not ussualy stop and talk to him and seems a little nervous around him.
The background information changes Paul's view on the Mr. Leonard. He knows now that he can help Mr. Leonard read while Mr. Leonard teaches him how to hurdle in a sort of compensation in Paul's eyes. Paul feels more motivated at the end of the story because Mr. Leonard is like him in so many ways that he feels he can achieve something like he had done in college.
The information brought Mr. Leonard and Paul closer because Paul felt like Mr. Leonard's feelings of embarrassment were familiar to himself.
When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard's background information he feels that he can relate to him. Paul could tell that when Mr. Leonard told him what happen to him in college he was embarassed just like he was when he was chosen to read something aloud and didn't know the answer. He feels grateful that Mr. Leonard had given up his time to help him excel at something. Then Paul felt that he had to help him out.
Paul became very compassionate after getting information from Mr. Leonard. Paul started to understand how Mr. Leonard feeling about his life so Paul decided to teach him how to read. Also, Paul got some motivations for himself by the story of Mr. Leonard. He found although he is a goodd athletic in hardle, he still have to study very hard. He still should finish his college and get his scholarship. Becasue he learned how study is important for an atheltic from Mr. Leonard's experience. No college would like to have a athletic who does not know how to read. That made Paul want to study harder than before.
The information about Mr. Leonard effects Paul greatly. Paul now has to goals to strive for, hurdles and reading. Mr Leonard's personal feats will push Paul harder and further to reach his goals.
Paul found information on the website Mr. Leonard asked him to look up. He found out that Mr. Leonard was a very good athlete in college. Leonard won a 400 meter hurdles at Nationals, but he couldn't continue on in college because his grades were poor. Leonard didn't want Paul to be like him. He wanted paul to be able to be a reader and a athlete at the same time. So he helped paul train and Paul helped him how to read.
The effect on the information that Paul has received is remarkable information to him. He finds out that the teacher that is willing to help succeed and was doing it with a hurdle, was actually a really good hurdler in school. When Paul takes back the information to ask Mr.Leonard about the article. Paul comes with a grin on his face, that to me seems like hes amazed and feels pretty grateful for someone like Mr.Leonard to come and encourage him to keep trying with the hurdle.
The effect of the background information that Paul gets from Mr. Leonard is Paul now knows that he is not the only one with a hard time. It helps Paul realize that everyone is good at one thing while another may be harder to accomplish.
The backround information about Mr. Leonard excites Paul because Paul is likeing doing track every day and is ammazed by the success that Mr. Leonard has had with track in college. Then the information about how Mr. Leonard couldnt read inspires Paul because Paul is going through the same thing.
Paul starts to understand why Mr. Leonard is helping him with track. He also realizes why the first time at the track Mr. Leonard did not know his name.
The effect that the background information about Mr. Leonard had on the reader is that Mr. Leonard could not read and he was trying to help someone that was also in his postion, so it shows that he is a kind man that cares about people and helps people if they need it.  The effect that the background information has on Paul is that he realizes that he can be successfull, just like Mr. Leonard, even though he can not read.
Paul feels he can relate to Mr. Leonard. Paul knows how if feels to not be able to read. He knows how it feels to be embarrassed when called upon to read aloud. Also, he knows how it feels to not know the answer that everyone else knew.
The background information about Mr.Leonard motivated Paul and encourage him  of working harder. There are many plots that can support the point, among which one detail is predominant.  As it is mentioned in the paragragh, when Paul heard the experience of Mr. Leonard, he felt the same way as he is not a good reader and always feels the embarrassment when answering questions in front of the class. Mr.Leonard's story motivated him and implied the fact that if he doesn't study hard and give it up, it will cause a great pity in his life.   From what has been discussed above, the background information of Mr. Leonard had a positive influence on Paul, motivated him to work hard and made him eager to provide help for Mr. Leonard.
The backgroung information affected Paul by letting him know Mr. Leonard can't read too.  This shows Paul that he can get better and not give up.  It also build his relationship with Mr. Leonard by going to the learning center together.
Paul is amazed. He couldn't believe that he broke records in the 400 meter hurdles in college.
Paul was surprised to find out that Mr. Leonard had, at one time, run track. This is evident in paragraph 35 line two when Paul pulls the printout from his pocket and asks, 'Why didn't you tell me about this?' Paul also began to relate to Mr. Leonard after Mr. Leonard told him that he also couldn't read. This fact can be found in paragraph 45 lines 2 through 4 when Paul said, 'I knew them well---feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew.' Finally, Paul felt that he should be kind and help Mr. Leonard learn to read, just as Mr. Leonard had helped him learn to jump hurdles. The final paragraph reads, 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' I said, walking back toward school. 'It's time to start your training.'
Paul found out that Mr. Leonard couldn't read, like himself. He also found out that Mr. Leonard was a track star and that he couldn't go any further in track than he did because he couldn't read. With finding that out Paul wanted to go further so he knew he needed to work hard to improve on his reading and also that maybe him and Mr. Leonard could work on it together.
The background information that Paul discovers about Mr. Leonard helps Paul realize that Mr. Leonard is trying to help Paul in life, because no one helped Mr. Leonard. Instead of just letting Paul continually struggle through life and not have anyone to help him Mr. Leonard steps up and gives Paul what Mr. Leonard himself never had.
The background information that Paul learns about Mr. Leonard surprises him and it encourages him to help Mr Leonard. It surprises Paul because he asks Mr. Leonard about why he never told him that he was a track star. The information also encourages him because at the end of the reading Paul decides to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
He finds out that mr. Leonard is a poor reader and Paul is also a poor reader and it makes him want to try harder.
In the beginning of the story Paul thinks Mr. Leonard is just the hall montitor. Then after he gets the background information on Mr.Leonard his viewpoint changes. He realizes that Mr. Leonard is just like him, but Mr. Leonard didn't have a learning center to help him read when he was in school. This caused Mr. keonard to flunk out of college which is why he is helping Paul. Also the background information makes Paul emphatic towards Mr. Leonard and will probably cause him to go to college and not flunk out for Mr. Leonard.
The background information influences Paul. It is because of the information that he wants to join the track team.
After he found out so much information about Mr.Leonards background it incouraged him to work even harder. He started to believe in himself. He new that he could accomplish anything as long as he put his mind to it. Not only did he believe in himself Mr.Leonard believed in him too.
Paul feels the same Mr. Leonard does,'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all to familiar to me. I knew them well---feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew. This man had to given the time to help me excel at something. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.     Paul is really familiar with these and feels that now he can do something for Mr. Leonard too.'C'mon, Mr. leonard,' I said walking back toward school.'It's time to start your training.'' Paul is inspired to help out Mr. leonard so he can properly read even though he flunked college, he is eager to help.It's one of the best things to do is help someone, even if they are 10 or 50 years old they can always learn new tricks.
In this story, the background information about Mr. Leonard, especially at the end, is similar to the situation the narrator was in.  For example, at the end, when Mr. Leonard mentioned that he had failed out of college, which was comparable to the situation the narrator was in because of his inability to read.  Realizing this, Mr. Leonard thinks that by having the narrator do what he did, he can overcome the obstacles, which were similar to the obstacles he had.
The effect that Paul had was consideration more than anything because Mr. Leonard was just a  hallway monitor when he could of been so much more than that. When Paul found out about Mr. Leonard, he wanted to find out why Mr. Leonard 'gave up' on his dream, but he later found out that he flunked out of college. Paul found this out because he look up that URL that the track coach gave him and he asked andpushed the answers to Pauls questions. So he tried to live his dream out on Paul in a way.
The information Paul gets inspires him to keep up the good work. Paul also knows that he needs to keep up his tutoring in order to stay on the team.
He was suprised to discover that he was so good at one point in time and he wanted to know what happened, and why their weren't any other stories.
It makes Paul feel closer to the coach because they both have the same reading problems. Also they are both good hurdelers.
In the baxkgroung ionformation it effects paul majorly because he thought that the teacher was great!! He did not know that he ran track or did any field activities until he recieved that website from a coach.  He was kind of upset about it but he got up and encouraged his teacher to get back on the track.
When Mr. Leonard tells Paul, 'The college scouts told me that my grades didn't matter, that I'd have tutors to help me, but college work was a whole lot harder than high school work. I lost mt scolarship and fluncked out. no other school wanted a runner who couldn't read.' I feel that it opeed Pauls eyes and made him think if himslf. I belive that information made Paul think of his future and how him and Mr. Leonard aren't that different. Also, when Paul says 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' 'It's time to start your training.' I feel Paul and Mr. Leonard are closer because Mr. Leonard told Paul thoes secret things about him.
It has a very big effect on Paul because, Mr. Leonard went to college to be on the track team and he flunked out because he was not a good student, Paul is also having a problem with his grades because he cannot read very well, so he goes to the remedial reading program twice a week.  And he looks up to Mr. Leonard because he is going through the same thing that he did.      Mr. Leonard flunked out of college because the college scouts told him that there would be tutors at the college that could help him get his grades up, but there were'nt any so he flunked.  Mr. Leonard wanted to show paul that he could do anything that he worked at and kept practicing.
Well Paul dose not know how to read that good. And when he gets on the URL and when he asked Mr. Leonard about it and he says he dose not know how to read. Paul knows how that feels. And then he gose and showes him how to read.
I believe that Paul is changed even more by finding out about Mr. Leonard's college life. It shows Paul that even if you're bad at education you can still be great at other things. It opens up a new world for Paul is what I'm saying overall.
The background information about Mr. Leonard makes Paul realize that eventhough  he might be terrible at reading, he needs to keep practicing and overcome his fears, just like he has done with the hurdles.

The background that Paul got of Mr.Leonard effected him possitively. Now that Paul knows just because you can't read doesn't mean you can't do anything you put your mind to.
It tells him that if Mr. Leonard can win at these huirdles and teach him how to do it. He can teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
Paul is in the same situation as Mr. Leonard. When mr. Leonard asked Paul what his name is  he should of known it because he had check Paul's pass for the past two weeks, but Mr/ Leonard did not know it because he could not read.
Paul feels some what connect to Mr. Leonard, seeing how they both have reading disabilty and now they are both good at jumping hurdles. Mr. Leonard that since he didnt get proper help with his reading problem and Paul was that Paul could do better then him with reading and track.
Mr. Leonard helps Paul find something that he can be good at, and Paul probably takes Mr. Leonard's kindness for granted. He is certainly grateful for Mr. Leonard's kindness, but fails to see Mr. Leonard's motives. When Paul learns about Mr. Leonard's background, about his track and field records and how he flunked out of college, it profoundly changes Paul's view of Mr. Leonard.      According to Paul, 'this man had given his time to help me excel at something'. He realizes that Mr. Leonard fully understands Paul and that he's trying to give Paul confidence to succeed. Mr. Leonard's story also encourages Paul to help Mr. Leonard in return, by helping him improve his reading skills.

The background information on Mr. Leonard is impowering for Paul in specific ways. Paul had no idea about Mr. Leonard because a Track and Feild star, but he listened to him anyways, when the coach gave him the URL to look him up he was surpirsed. When he confronted Mr. Leonard about the whole thing he was surprised with his responce. He wondered what happened, why he hadn't done it since he won the 400 meter hurdles as a freshman. Paul could really relate his story to Mr. Leonard because he as well couldn't read. Unlike Mr. Leonard, he had the resources to help with his problem of not being able to read. When Mr. Leonard was done explaining his story he thought since he help him that he would help him learn how to read.

In my opinion, he most likely felt more of a connection with the older man at this point, and he realized at last why Mr. Leonard was so determined to coach him in track after school. As is usually the case with students and their teachers, Paul is probably also somewhat surprised to discover that Mr. Leonard has had his own difficulties in life.     However, Mr. Leonard's story also has another effect on Paul - It encourages him to work harder so he doesn't suffer the same fate. After this, Paul will probably try to put more effort into his studies and receive better grades in his classes. After being confronted with the possibilities of what could happen to him if he doesn't do so, he probably has more determination not to end up losing all that he hopes to achieve like Mr. Leonard has.     Paul is also probably grateful to the learning center at his school, which he took for granted in the past. Although he initially viewed it as something to be embarrassed about, he most likely is now thankful that he has people to assist him and motivate him when Mr. Leonard didn't have the same luxury.

Pauls act of saying, 'It's time to start your training' to Mr. Leonard shows the value of a true relationship.  Paul is helping Mr. Leonard after Mr. Leonard helped him.  One kind act to another is exactly what has happened. Without any of the background information, none of this would have happened.
Once Paul understands the background of coach, it can reassure him that he has what it takes to overcome the obsticle. He does not feel as isolated or alone. He realizes that there are other individuals out there with the same problems, and if they can overcome them, he can too.
The Narrater, paul, is shocked beacause Mr. Leanard was helping him and he never told him that he couldnt read either.

Paul is a kid that can't read, and Mr. Leonard seemed to take an interest in him and was going to help him learn how to be a good runner, because he thinks it will help him out. Paul listens to Mr. Leonard without any hesitation and quickly learns to run very well.

The fact the Mr. Leonard took Paul under his wing to help him accomplish things in life better, and that Mr. Leonard wanted to help Paul because he never got any help tells the real type of mean Mr. Leonard is and Paul sees that and is very greatful.

What Paul had found out, I think helped him to persue in his learning and to help him be good in the hurdles. I think that Paul started to think to realize that education is one of the highest things that you can get. Paul saw Mr. Leonard as a great athlete who didn't have the good grades to finish the total package. I think that Paul will learn that you have to be smart and have an education and then the rest will come later.

Mr. Leonard couldn't read, so he flunked out of college and was embarrassed about it. This is similiar to Paul's situation. They both are good hurdlers, they couldn't read, and they felt embarrassed about it. So once Paul hears about how Mr. Leonard can't read, he wants to train him to read just like Mr. Leonard trained Paul to be a good hurdler.
The effect it had on Paul was that he didn't understand it, thats why he says to Mr. Leonard 'Why didn't you tell me about this?'

He asked, Why didnt you tell me about this? Mr. Leonard answered I was a good runner but wasn't a really good student. Mr. Leonard was a very poor reader and he failed college.

Mr.Leonard dose not want Paul to know what had happen to him when he was in colloge. He is afrade if he tells Paul what happen to him Paul might give up and not go out and try for track.     Mr.Leonard wants Paul to go and try for track and see how Paul likes track. If Paul dose not like track then Mr.Leonard can tell Paul what happen to him when he was in track.
Mr. Leonard's background information has an effect on Paul because he left his English class early Monday through Friday to meet Mr. Leonard at 2:30 at the learning center in the basement of his school. He helped Paul practice hurdles. Rain or shine they still practiced.
When Mr. Leonard tells him that he was a good athlete but nobody wanted a runner who couldn't read, Paul felt empathetic because he knows how it feels to not be able to read. He also felt sad because Mr. Leonard was such a good athlete that he broke records, but he never got the chance to fulfill his dream because he never learned to read.
Mr. Leonard was in the same position as  Paul so he wanted to tell Paul about him so paul wouldnt end up like him. Mr. Leonard had trouble studying and he saw that Paul was startin to go down the path that he went in.
all he wanted was to get in the big leads

Paul didn't know that Mr. Leonard was good at track and broke records. He was kind of upset because Mr. Leonard didn't tell him that he couldn't read and flunked out of college.
The effect Paul had from finding out that Mr. Leonard was a poor student was that he completely understood what Mr. Leonard had went through. Like the text says 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well - feelings of embarassment when I was called upon to read aloud in class or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew', Paul felt empathy for Mr. Leonard. It also motivated and encouraged Paul to take Mr. Leonard with him to the learning center and learn how to read like in the text Paul says 'C'mon Mr. Leonard. It's time to begin your training.:
the effect it had on paul was that
When Paul sees that Mr. Leonard was a great high school athelete, he is inspired to do his best, and be like him. Also, having someone to look up to that used to do the same thing that you are doing is very nice when trying to accomplish something. When Paul learns that his role model was not a good student, and cannot read very well, he is empathetic for his new friend. Now that he and Paul have these things in common, they will begin to help each other in the areas in which they struggle with.
In many cases Leonard and Paul have much in common. Paul never learned to read neither did Leonard. Leonard encouraged Paul to do Track Paul could relate to Leonard.
The background information Paul gets about Mr. Leonard shows him that there are people out there like him, and that he can make something of himself. Mr. Leonard could never read, yet he broke records in college. Paul has difficulty reading as well, and he was always chosen last for sports. With the help of Mr. Leonard, he can make something of himself as well, and with the help of Paul, Mr. Leonard can finally learn how to read.
The background information gives Paul a sense of connection with Mr. Leonard. This connection rises from the fact that they both struggle with reading. Mr. Leonard became interested in him because he discovered that Paul had to take special classes to improve his reading while Mr. Leonard never got that help. After Paul joined the track team and found why Mr. Leonard stopped running track he found a way he could repay Mr. Leonard for training him in hurdles by 'training' him in how to read well. The ending creates a good give-take relationship.
Paul was sad for the caoch because the caoch had to quit running because of his grades.
Paul is the type of kid that is shy and that is always picked last when it comes to sports.
Paul is very confused and wants to know what happened to his amazing career as a track and field runner. He then learns the truth and is better motivated to continue working and help Mr. Leonard
He see that Mr. Leonard is more than a hall monitor and how good he was in high chool doin track and feild.
For Paul, finding out about Mr. Leonard's backround information allowed him to connect to the former track star. In paragraph 45, Paul says, 'the emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. Paul goes on to explain that he understands the feelings of embarrassment Mr. Leonard felt because he had felt them himself.
Mr. Leonard was a vary good athlete and he looked good. Leonard won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. He broke the records for hurdles. But, he wansnt a very good student. Paul strides to do good baecause they are exaclely alike. Paul pushes him self to do well like Mr. Leonard.
When Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard went to college and did great at the hurtles, he wonders why he quit. After the confession that Mr. Leonard could not read, Paul feels like there is someone who can share what he is feeling. He then feels that since Mr. Leonard helped him at the hurtles, he should help him learn something he never learned how to do...read. It is almost a 'payback' deal, except Paul is happy to help Mr. Leonard.
The effect of the background is that it makes him think all the reasons why he go him working out and the reasons why he's here. Also what he wants with him. Later he finds out and it kind of inspires Paul to shoot higher for goals.
Mr. Leonard checks Paul's hallpass twice a week, but he can't read, Paul doesn't realize that this was odd until later. After Paul gets a printout of Mr. Leonard's college career he found out that Mr. Leonard was a hurdler who broke records. Paul can relate to how Mr. Leonard felt when he had to read or didn't know answers. Paul now understood that he could overcome his problems to and become a hurdler like Mr. Leonard.
The effect that the backround information has on Paul is that in life education is just as important as being a track runner or professional athlete. And even though Paul had troubles in life he went and got help for reading just like Mr. Leonard needed in his high school years.
Paul felt a feeling of understanding. In the text it explains how Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to him because Paul knew that feeling of embarrassment when he was called upon to read aloud or when he didn't know an answer that everyone else knew. The background information about Mr. Leonard helped Paul realize how fortunate he was and that he wasn't alone.
Paul understood what Mr. Leonard felt like. He says he knew the feelings well. Then he goes on and he describes how he was emabrassed because he couldn't read too. The coach wanted paul to excel at something since he could not read. At the end paul decides to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
The background information on Mr. Leonard helps him relate to Paul. In the story, Paul goes to the learning center to learn how to read better, and later Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard cannot read too well either. This brings a closeness and a sense of empathy to Paul. Since Mr. Leonard is helping him with track, Paul figures that he can return the favor by helping him with the tutoring he never got. This shows how grateful Paul is.
Mr. Leonard background informatiosn makes Paul feel bad for him. So she starts to help them and went from being one of his students to be his trianer.
Pual felt some sort of empathy because he knows what it's like not being able to read well. In the story Paul knows what Mr. leonard went threw, it said he knows the feelings of embarrassment when someone called on him to read aloud.
It shows Paul that no matter what, you need to learn to do things your own self and that no matter how hard the obsticle is, you put all your effort and practice and you will get better. Mr. Leonard didn't know how to read and he found out the hard way that you can't relay on anyone, you will have to learn by yourself. Pual finds out about Mr. Leonard and figures out that all he wants to do is to help Pual to become better and learn  about hard times that he has had in the past and he does not want Pual to have the same problem he did.
Ehen Paul was reserching on Mr. Leonard, he found out the he to, could not read. Paul and Mr. Leonard have that diability to read and that is what braught them to being friends and why Mr. Leonard brought him to the track to have him jump the hurdles. It teaches Paul to overcome the tough obsicals in life as Mr. Leonard almost did.
The effect it had was that he got him into sports. He helped Paul he wanted to make him do better in life. And just to do the right things. That's why he was asking so many questions and getting him to come to the gym after school.
In the story Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a track star. It makes Paul wonder why he wan't told and makes him want to ask Mr. Leonard. When Paul asks, Mr. Leonard tells him about his experience in college and about how he flunked out. Paul seems shocked and figures out that Mr. Leonard was trying to help him get good at something. He also repsected that Paul was trying to get help with his problem reading other than relying on others.

It makes Paul feel like he can be just as good as Mr. Leonard, but he wants to try and get good grades and not rely on others to get by.
That is not a very good reader so he went to the learning center. To try to get help with his reading skills cause he really wanted to run track. So he broght up his english class grade and he got torun track.
I think it had a bad feeling on Paul at first just for the fact that he didnt tell him. But once he got to know him he may have thought there is a ligit reason to why he didnt tell him.
The effect, on Paul, about discovering the background information on Mr. Leonard is empathy. Paul understands exactly how Mr. Leonard feels, 'embarrassed.' Paul feels led, that sinse his coach had taken such an interest in him and took time to help him overcome his obstacles, that he should return the favor and help excel Mr. Leonard with his disability.
That Paul is able to do much more with this kind of help. He is one of the select few of the remedial program.
As the story begins the reader learns Mr. Leonard is simply a hall monitor doing his job, no one really seems to take notice in him and school goes on in the same way it always does. It isn't until Paul gets stopped by Mr. Leonard one day that we first get a glimpse of who this hall monitor is. Many foreshadowing events occur from this point forward- the empathy in his eyes when he learns Paul can't read, the mysterious way he calls Paul to the gym and then to the track, and even the encouragement he gives to Paul gives the reader many hints on who this character is as a person. When the track coach gives Paul some interesting information to look up about this said hall monitor, that is when we really see who Mr. Leonard was. We learn how successful he was on the track, but when asked about this we also learn how unsuccessful he was off the track. Paul is very shocked to hear Mr. Leonard Grabowski was an avid hurdle jumping track participent in his day, but when he goes directly to the man behind all of it, Mr. Leonard, he gets a more personal outlook on what it was truly like for him. This gives Paul a new appreciation for his education, but also for Mr. Leonard after realizing just who this hall monitor once was, and in a way- still is.

It shows me as the reader how Paul's life is and what he has to go through. When it shows me that it creates a bond between the character and the reader. Details from the story that support this are ones like ' When you're the last guy chosen for teams in gym class'.
The background information Paul gets about Mr. Leonard effects Paul becuase, he learns that Mr. Leonard has the same feelings, and the same problem he does. That makes Paul feel like he isn't alone, and that he could try to help Mr. Leonard with the same problem Paul has with reading. It also makes him feel like he can acheive things, that he didn't know he could.
When he finds out who Mr, Leonard really is he feel like he should help him out by showing him how to read, because Mr, Leonard shows Paul how to become faster in running and give good tips
The affect the background information has on Paul is that Paul had no clue that Mr. Leonard ran track and was really good.

Mr. Leonard teaches Paul how to jump hurdles to help him become confident and enjoy life even though he's behind in learning how to read.
It gives Paul confidence because now he knows he is not the only one that is not able to read either. At the beginning of the story he felt all alone, and was tired of always being the last one chosen for a game. When Mr. Leonard came along and helped boost his confidence. When he found out the things about Mr. Leonard it made him want to do good for others that struggle. And so therefore Paul wanted to help Mr. Leonard how to read.

Paul was upset that Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about how he won national in the 400 meter hurdles. Paul printed the information out and confronted him and asked him why he didn't tell him about his past.
Paul seem intrested in what had happened. He was amazed that Mr. Leonard had ran track and beat records After doing research on Grabowski just like his coach had told him to do. He was curious to why Mr. Leonard had not ran anymore after that. Once Paul had found out that Mr. Leonard had gone through the same thing he was he knew how Mr. Leonard had felt because he had the same feelings of embarrassment. Mr. Leonard could not read either, so when he went to college he lost his scholarship and flunked out, but no other school wanted a runner that could not read. Paul then decided to do something for Mr. Leonard, and tell him to start his training.
When Paul found out Mr. Leonard was in track and had broken records he was suprised, and wondered why he did not hear about it before. When Paul figured out that Mr. Leonard could not read he felt sympathetic for him because he wasnt good at reading either.
Paul is suprised to see that Mr. Leonard was a excellent runner, but he also develops sympathy towards his teacher because he says in line 45, ' The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well--feelings of embarrassement...'. He almost draws closer to Mr. Leonard because he realizes they both have something in common.

He realizes that he is just like Mr. Leonard because they both can not read.
In my understanding it seemed like he was all around surprized because Mr. Leonard was a track star and the fact he had a reading problem. For the kind and friendly training Mr. Leonard did, Paul felt he should return the favor and help him to read.

He can relate to him in the way that he can't read very well.
During the story. the reader gets background information about Mr. Leonard. This background information has an interesting effect on Paul because Paul is unsure why anyone that good would be unknown.  Paul assumes that Mr. Leonard would have told him about his time as a college freshman winnning the 400 meter hurdles at nationals, breaking the previous record, as stated in the text.  Then after learning the complete story for how Mr. Leonard went to college still unable to read and flunked out, loosing his scholarship. Paul then connects this information with how Mr. Leonard asked his name when he read his pass twice a week, every week, and concludes that he still is unable to read and Paul decides to start tutoring Mr. Leonard to teach hi to be able to read since Mr.Leonard had taught him to run and jump hurdles very well.

Mr.Leonard was suspicious about what the narrator was doing. When Paul told the teacher that he couldn't read, The teacher helped him out to be successful when he gets to high school.
Finding out that Mr. Leonard couldn't read made Paul want to help him learn just like Mr. Leonard had helped Paul become good at jumping hurdles in track.
When Paul discovers Mr. Leonard's past track excellence, he becomes inquisitive, then empithetic.  Paul's natural curiosity is demonstrated by his confronting Mr. Leonard about the startling information he discovered online.  His continued curiosity is demonstrated through his continual questioning and prying such as in '`But you went to college,'' and 'I pressed'.' Paul later becomes empethetic when he offers to 'train' Mr. Leonard how to read and when Paul states ' The emotions in Mr. Leonards voice were all to familiar to [Paul].'  When Paul confronts Mr. Leonard, his natural curiosity turns to empathy.
Paul felt bad for Mr. Leonard, and he is teaching him how to read since Mr. Leonard taught him how to hurdle.
When Paul learns about who Mr. Leonard was, that inspires Paul. Paul knows that he is unable to read well but he is able to run well.

This is told when the article says, 'You were a college freshmen who won the 400 ,eter hurdles at nationals. You broke records.' (line 38-39). This proves to Paul that even though he is unable to read well, he is still able to be the best at something else i his life.     Mr. Leonard also encourages Paul whenever he tells about how he was unable to complete college because he is unable to read. Mr. Leonards says, 'I lost my scholarship and flunnked out.' (line 47). This statement is important to Paul to because it helpps him realize that he still has to learn to read even if he is a good runner. Paul learns that his running life and scholarship could be lost too if he doesn't learn to read. So this encourages Paul to work hard and learn how to read.
The effects that Mr. Leonards past was on paul was that it reminded paul of himself. He felt the embarrisment When he was called apone to read or when he did not know an awnser every one else new. It all reminded him of Mr. Leanard who was a track star that flunked out of college because he could not read.

The background information that Paul receives about Mr. Leonard motivates him in two ways. It motivates him to work harder on his studies and not repeat the same mistake that Mr. Leonard made in his college days and it also motivates him to help Mr. Leonard to learn how to read better. He helps him to read better because of the help Mr. Leonard provided him in the hurdles. This is, in a way, his repayment to Mr. Leonard and it will also help him appreciate school more. The background information helped the Paul understand more about Mr. Leonard, while at the same time, it helped the reader understand the motives behind what Mr. Leonard did.
When Paul goes to the track coach, the coach tells Paul to look up the name 'Grabowski.'  Paul follows directions and finds out about Mr. Leonard's past.  The website tells Paul that Mr. Leonard broke the 400 meter hurdle record as a freshman in college.  When Paul asks Mr. Leonard about this, Mr. Leonard comences to tell Paul that he was a fantastic runner, but a less than average student.  Paul takes this information as an encouragement.  It encourages him to excel in both school and sports.  Mr. Leonard's past also encourages Paul to help Mr. Leonard by helping him learn how to read.
Mr. Leonard was a good athlete when he was younger, but he couldn't read, he was just not a good student much like what Paul seems to be like since he cannot read. So when Mr. Leonard sees him in the hallway over and over again going to his study tables he notices that Paul seems like a motivated kid that wants to do well. So then Mr. Leonard thinks that he should ask Paul to start hurdling, and if he works hard in that just like he does in school, then maybe he can go off to college for hurdling but if he gets good grades he won't flunk out and that will make Mr. Leonard forget about his past a little.
The information concerning Mr. Leonard gave Paul motivation. I believe this is because Paul has finally met someone who understands his struggles with reading. After discovering that Mr. Leonard could not read, Paul immediately wanted to help him as Mr. Leonard had helped Paul with the hurdles. Paul saw that not being able to read had damaged Mr. Leonard's life and he felt the need to help Mr. Leonard. Paul shows this by saying 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard. It's time to start your training.' Also, seeing their similarities motivated Paul to better himself in education and with the hurdles. This is the effect which Mr. Leonard's background information had on Paul.
Paul is surprised that Mr. Leonard went to collage and won nantionls when he was a freshman in collage. He also was curious of why he quit.
The information that Paul finds about Mr. Leonard is that he couldn't read in school either, but he broke records. Paul was shocked that Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about how good of an athlete he was. Paul was also shocked to the discovery that Mr. Leonard couldn't read either. Paul knew that Mr. Leonard was probably embrassed because he couldn't read and Paul knew how it felt.
paul might thought that he did not know what he was doing.
He didnt know that Mr. Leonard was a track runner and it pushed him to do better.
Mr. Leonard has helped Paul building his skill as a hurdler and Paul decides to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read.
After learning about Mr. Leonard's past he relizes why he is being helped by Mr. Leonard because in high school Mr. Leonard was a poor reader, too. Paul decides he wants to help Mr. Leonard to repay him for all that Mr. Leonard has done for him by helping train to be good at something.
Mr. Leondard has done well so he trys to teach someone he can pass down too.
After Paul learns of Mr. Leonard's past, he is curious and surprised. Paul learned of his achievements and wondered why he didn't continue to do track after he won the nationals. It was hard for Paul to understand why so much talent went to waste until he found out that Mr. Leonard wasn't able to read. Paul felt closer to Mr. Leonard because they had the same emotions.
The background informations effect on Paul is that it inspires him. He sees how even though Mr. Leonard couldn't read that he still excelled past people in something else. Paul looks up to Mr. Leonard and Paul wants to return the favor and help Mr. Leonard.
Mr. Leonard is a hall moniter, which makes Paul think that he is just another teacher or adult that nobody wants to talk to.  He kept students in line and out of trouble.
he starts workimg out with the track team
The background information that Paul gets makes him see that he was not the only one that couldn't read. He is touched by the fact that Mr. Leonard took his time to coach him into being better. He wants to do something nice for Mr. Leonard just like he did for him.
When Paul gets information about Mr. Leonard about his pass it helps to motivate him to shoot for his dreams even if he does failed atleast he try to do it.
Background information can actualy help Paul. As to whether or not something has happened to the other person or not in the past, and give information about a persons past.
He understands how he feels because he has the same problems.But he is getting help and is getting better.
paul feels petrayed becuase he should have told him at the begginning that he was a star .
This information on Mr.Leonard makes Paul wonder why Mr.Leonard didn't finish college. It also made Paul wonder why Mr.leonard had the job that he had because he was a track star and he broke records.  How this information and what Mr.Leonard told him all sounded so fimiliar to him because he was treated the same way how he couldn't read and was teased because he didn't know the answer to a question that evryone else knew.
Paul confronts Mr.Leonard about the information he has discovered and, talks about how come Mr.Leonard didn't tell him about him breaking track records.He also asks what happened to him breaking records and mr.Leonard told him he flunked out of college.
Paul was pretty shocked when he learns more about Mr. Leonard. He is also very suspicious because Mr. Leonard never shared this with him. Knowing this helped motivate Paul in track, and learning to read.
Paul was a poor reader.  Knowing that Mr. Leonard had flunked out of college just because he was a bad learner made him realize that they had something in common.  Mr. Leonard worked with Paul to get better at track.  Mr. Leonard told Paul to keep trying and work hard.  Paul hearing this knows now that you have to keep working hard and keep trying to succeed.  Paul knows that Mr. Leonard should keep trying with his grade and in time he will get better.
Near the end of the story, Paul reads that Mr. Leonard has had problems with reading, although he was a great track hurdler. That had a big effect on Paul because Paul has the same problem, which is That he can't read. He goes to the remedial reading program so he can learn to read. The coach knew that, so he had Paul do the hurdles so he could show Paul that even though you can't read, you can still do well in other areas, but you should still try your hardest cause life is hard when you can't read well.
It made him think about his reading problem, and that he needs to keep it up and he'll get better, which motivated him to help Mr. Leonard to learn to read.
The words that Mr. Leonard said were all too familiar to Paul. He felt embarrassment when he got called on in class to read out loud.
The effect that Mr. Leonard's background has on Paul is really powerful. Paul realizes that this teacher isn't just some other annoying teacher. Mr. Leonard was in the exact same boat as Paul was in, and gave him advice on how to overcome it and encouragement to let Paul know he could do it, depsite being unable to read very well.
When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard's past, Paul feels like he can relate to this. Paul says, after learning how Mr. Leonard funked out of college because he could not read, 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well-feelings of embarrassment...' (45). This describes the situation Paul is going through right now and it provides a stronger connection between the two characters.
The background of Mr. Leonard is something he himslelf wishes he could change. He is dissapointed that he dropped out of college and was force to quit track. These are lessons to the narrator, because he is young enough to take a stand for himself  and outline his life by knowing what he needs to know. If he keeps working on his english struggles he will become better and better. It is a lesson to make school a priority of track. It also shows the narrator that if he works really hard at something and gives it 100 percent, he can accomplish anything.
The coach for the track team tells Paul to look up Grabowski on the website when he got home. When he did this he relizes that the man who had been teaching him to hurdle was once a record breaking great athlete. When paul confronts him about this Grabowskibegins telling Paul about his past and how he had actually lost his scholarship and flunked out of college because he could not read. That's when Paul learns that he couldn't read either then Paul decides to help his trainer 'train' learn to read.
Mr. Leonard use to be a runner as well.
It reminds him of his-self from being good at track but not academically good atleast in reading.
Mr. Leonard went through similar expirences as Paul like he relied on friends to help me get by.
He felt bad for Leonard becasue he was a good rinner but a bad reader and lost his scolership and droped out of college
When Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a star track and field athlete in college he becomes confused as to why Mr. Leonard kept it from him. Mr. Leonard then went on to explain that he had difficulty reading and flunked out of college. Paul felt empathetic because he had the same problem with school. Realizing that Mr. Leonard had helped Paul excel at something, Paul decided to start 'training' Mr. Leonard how to read.
He seems surprised by it.
It makes him feel better about himself. It makes him want to put forth effort and get things acompleshed.
That he knows if he puts his mind to it he could do anything because; once he saw that Mr. Leonard use to run track and he didnt know how to read. Then he knew that he could get really good at reading because look Mr. Leonard is a teacher and he use not beable to read.
Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a track star in college, which seems to inspire him. He wanted to know about his experience and as Mr. Leonard told him about it, Paul began to realize that he and Mr. Leonard were pretty similar. Mr. Leonard taught Paul how to run and do hurdles, and Paul wanted to help teach Mr. Leonard something.
The effects it has on Paul is he is angery because Mr. Leonard was a really good 400 meter hurdles.  Now he is at a high school teaching Paul how to run track.
It shows why mr. leonard became friends with paul and taught him how to run track. And it made paul want to do good at track and learn how to reead.
Paul realizes that the learning center will only help him, and that he doesn't want to lose his dreams like Mr. Leonard did because he can't read.  Mr. Leaonard tol dhim that nobody wants a track star that can't read, and when Paul realizes this he knows that he has to try to make what he wants in life happen.
Paul was surprised when he found out that Mr. Leonard couldn't read either . Paul would have never know unless the coach had gave him that website . It made Paul want to try harder to learn to read so he could give something back to Mr. Leonard .
The background information that Paul learned about Mr. Leonard motivated him.  It showed Paul that he could succed in something other than reading, just as Mr. Leonard did.  Just like the confidence Paul showed when talking to Mr. Leonard after he found out about Mr. Leonard's past.
Paul is surprised by the fact that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college, but as he is listening to him speak about his failures, he realizes that he feels the same about his grades. Paul recognizes that 'This man had given his time to help me excel at something' and decides to help Mr. Leonard with schooling because he was never good at it.
he can Relate to him
Whern paul realized Mr. Leonard had the same problems as him it created a bond between them.And they could understand where eachother was coming from.
Mr. Leonard was a major track star in college. But they found out that he could not read. So he lost his scholarship and he flucked out of college. They did not wanted a kid that could not read. Mr. Leonard did not wanted Paul to be like him so he told him all about his pass so he could get his grades up and go to college.
After Paul was informed about Mr. Leonard's backround he seems to get closer to Mr. Leonard because they had a lot more in common then he had thought. Both Mr. Leonard and Paul had trouble with reading which caused Mr. Leonard to want to help Paul.
The background on Mr. Leonard inspired Paul to succeed in track because of the expectations he had on him; Paul didn't want to let him behind because all the motivation he had encouraged him with and the reputation behind Mr. Leonard.
Paul was surprised that Mr. Leonard was a track star in college. Paul is also excited about his newly found knowledge of Mr. Leonard. He felt like he knew what Mr. Leonard felt. The embarrassment shows they are a lot alike.
It made him feel sorry for Mr. Leonard since he lost his scholarship and flunked out of college.
to standy on top of things
The nararator becomes more accepting of his mentor and coach. He feels that he has good support under his feet as he takes the path of the sport. You can tell from the way the narrator speaks to Mr. Leonard after he finds out about Mr. Leonard's past
Though just a lowly hall monitor, Mr. Leonard used to be an extreamly successful track star. When Paul discovers this, he wonders what went wrong in his life to pull him away from a life of success into being a hall monitor. Mr. Leonard then tells about how he couldn't read, just like Paul. It affects Paul in two ways. First, it makes him realize why Mr. Leonard wanted him to start running; because he saw himself in Paul. Second, it made Paul realize that they had alot in common as well, and made him want to persevere.
Mr. Leonard wants this boy to graduate college but he dont trust him.
At the beginning of the story, Paul is having trouble in school. Reading is difficult for him and he is picked last for teams in sports. The hall monitor, Mr. Leonard, decides to help Paul by coaching him in hurdling. Paul gets background information about the monitor and is surprised by what he finds. His coach was a freshman at college when he won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals, and broke records. The problem was, Mr. Leonard had dropped out of college because he was failing: he couldn't read very well either. Just like Paul, school was too difficult for him and he had to give up what he loved because no other college would accept him. Paul was moved by this, and decided to get Mr. Leonard a tutor so he could reapply to a college and live his dream.
The background information helps Paul, because we now know that he has a former highschool track runner that broke records as a hurdler to help him be better as a hurdler than just a hall monitor.
The effects that the background information had on paul were that he realized that just because you're bad at one thing doesnt mean that you're bad at every thing you do.  This is because he learns that Leonard also had problems reading but could win nationals as a freshman in the 400 meter hurdles.
The effect the background background information about Mr. Leonard has on Paul is he can empathsize with Mr. Leonard.      Paul struggled reading, and then Mr. Leonard helped him with hurdles and track. When Paul learned that Mr. Leonard had flunked out of college, even after being a big track star, ''the emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.'' Paul related to Mr. Leonard's failure of college and  the fact he couldn't read because Paul also struggled in it.      The effect it had on Paul was the he was familiar with the feeling. It is foreshadowed in the last sentence that since Mr. Leonard gave his time up to help Paul excel at hurdles, he was going to help Mr. Leonard at reading.
Paul is overwhelmed that Mr. Leonard has set and broken records at college. He was shocked that lead to him dropping out of college because he did not have very good grades.
I believe it gave Paul a sense of respect for Mr. Leonard and courage to continue what he is doing. Since Mr. Leonard went through the same problems as Paul did and still went to college, I believe Paul gained respect since the hurdle Mr. Leonard went over must have been difficult. He also must have gained courage since if one person could do it, he can do it as well.
He is a  good people he  is smart he is a inteligent and hava a talentenyng and  he wanr mark the diferent adn the other people.
Paul is surprised on what he has learned about Mr. Lenards back ground, and he ask him what happend to him.
Mr. Leonard didn't want to tell Paul about him being a track star in college becuase maybe he was ashamed that he had flunked out and didn't want him to know that he had trouble in school sometimes too.
Finding out Mr. Leonard went to college, but flunked out allowed Paul to think about his future. In their talk about college, Paul realized they have alot in common. For example, 'I knew them well-feelings of embarrassement when I was called upon to read aloud or when i didn't know an answer everyone else knew.'
The effect of Paul about the background information about Mr. Leonard is that Paul and Mr. Leonard is almost alike because Mr. Leonard and Paul can't read and they both have run track in high school. Paul is willing to hepl Mr.Leonaard with his problem.
It made Paul realize that Mr. Leonard is very similar to himself. It also gave Paul the courage to contine in his track training. Paul felt very connected and concerned with Mr. Leonard.
Mr. Leonard used to be a track star in college and he also doesn't know how to read. So the influence that that had on Paul is that even though you can't read, that doesn't degrate you from doing other things in life.
When Mr. Leonard's past is revealed, it says the two of them on an even field.  Paul can now relate to Mr. Leonard and understand that he is not alone.  This information allows Paul to respect his 'coach' even more now.
i think paul is a great guy
When Paul knows about the background information about Mr. Leonard he identifies him self on what he says because Mr. Leonard couldn't read like Paul. But what was different is that the schools before didn't have anything to help students then. What Mr. Leonard is trying to do is to show that he is aforcanet for having a learning center that can help many students know then what they had then.
He could feel what Mr. Leonard was feeling, and he felt as if he needed to help with out with something, just as he helped Paul. So, he was going to teach him how to read.
The background information helps Paul realize why Mr.Leonard is so interested in hurdling, but then leads him to wonder why it is that Mr. Leonard is trying to help HIM learn to jump hurdles rather that anyone else.
The background information has a significant effect on Paul.  When Paul first learns from his coach that Mr. Leonard was a star athlete, he goes and asked about what happened.  Mr. Leonard told Paul that he could not read and fluncked out of college, which Paul himself could relate to.  In the end they both bettered the other and a way.
When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard's past, he is shocked at first. Mr.Leonard used to be a very successful track athlete. However, he didn't have the grades to continue doing well in college and he eventually lost his scholarship.     I think Paul relates to what Mr. Leonard went through so well is because Paul was basically going through the same thing. He had to go the learning lab because he was unable to read. Not only could he not answer the right questions or read in class, but he was extremely embarrassed. He was afraid that he wouldn't be able to do anything since he believed that he wasn't that smart.      Mr. Leonard explains that he didn't have the resources when he was a child that Paul has now. All Mr. Leonard had was friends to help him, and unfortunately that didn't help his grades get better. He wants Paul to continue learning and to be succesful since he knows what its like to not be able to read.      Paul is affected greatly by the information he learns because he is going through the same thing. He relates to Mr. Leonard and in the end, that is why he decided that he would help him and get him to read.
When Paul get's the back ground informtion about Mr. Leonaredhe feels better because he know's now that not only does he stuggle but Mr. Leonared did as well.     This help's Paul look past the reason's he has to go to the learning center, and let's him focus on the thing's that he want's to do in sport's and now Paul can focus on being a better player all around in every sport he is in or try's.
The background infortmation effects Paul because it makes him want to work harder. Also, it makes Paul have empathy for Mr. Leonard. For example, at the end when he says 'C'mon , Mr. Leonard, It's time to start your training.' Paul wants to help Mr. Leonard get back into track because he can tell Mr. Leonard really enjoyed it when he was younger.
It turns out that Mr.Leonard had trouble reading just as Paul did. He flunked out of a collage that he got a track scholarship for. He taught paul how to run track well and when Paul looked up Mr.Leonards information he found that he was just like him. It made Paul feel closer to Mr.Leonard and he helped him read the way he had helped him run track.
The information it like how paul is struggling to read and that M. Leonard was going throught the same thing and that if he helped Paul then paul would help him read and overcome the embarrasment of not being able to read well.
He finds out the Mr. Leonard doesn't know much about sports soo he tries to help him as much as he can.
The effect on the backround information on Paul seemed like they  made them very similair in a way.  Mr. Leonard was a good athelete and couldnt read. Paul became a good athlete and is trying his harderst to learn how to read. There is a connection between them.     When they first met Mr. Leonard knew his own past and found out that Paul could not read. Mr. Leonard wanted Paul to be like him in a way just be better.     The backround information that Paul found out made him realize that they are the same and that Mr. Leonard just wanted to help Paul with his future and not be a hall monitor but to be somthing more succesful.
Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard as being someone who could not read. 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.'
Paul is shocked that Mr. Leonard didn't mention the fact that he was a college track star. Paul had no idea that his new coach was even a runner. Mr. Leonard didn't tell Paul because he was embarrassed that he flunked out, but in the end it showed Paul why Mr. Leonard wanted to help him.
The effect of the background information on Mr. Leonard is good and bad information, some good news is that he is a good track coach, but the bad is he fluncked out of school.
The backround information that Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard effects him in a positive way, because it makes Paul feel like someone else has gone through exactly what he is going through at that moment in time. Mr. Leonard states that he lost his scholarship and flunked out of college, because no school wanted a runner who could not read. Paul goes on to say that he knows Mr. Leonard's feelings of embarassment all to well, happening whenever he is called upon to read something aloud, or when he does not know an answer everyone else knows in class.
The story has an effect on Paul because he got the website URL from the high school track coach. And Paul went and looked at the website and seen some information he didn't know about Mr. Leonard, and wondered why he never told Paul. And then Paul and Mr. Leonard talk about it, after Paul showed him the page he printed off. And then Paul realized what he could do for Mr. Leonard after hearing the story.
Mr. Leonard was a hall monitor that was is job. So Paul is the main charatcer. Mr. Leonard wants to get him in to sports. Also Paul wa in college.
It inspires Paul to let Mr. Leonard help him keep becoming a better athlete.
conversations about how i cant read
Both Paul and Mr. Leonard are poor readers. Paul feels he's not good at sports. Mr. leonard used to be a great hurdler so he teaches Paul how to be a good hurdler. When Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard is a poor reader also he brings Mr. Leonard to the learning center to help him.
I feel that the background information that Paul discovered about Mr. Leonard gave Paul motivation.  Paul never tried any sports or extracurricular activities until Mr. Leonard helped Paul to achieve jumping hurdles.  Even though Paul was good at jumping hurdles, he felt as though he wasn't good enough.  When Paul found out that Mr. Leonard went to college for jumping hurdles but that Mr. Leonard flunked out, it make Paul want to try harder in multiple things.  He wanted to try to get better at hurdles, but he also wanted to finally learn how to read so that he didn't end up like Mr. Leonard.  Paul even decided that since Mr. Leonard helped him achieve something, he was going to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read.
Mr. Leonard had a background on Paul they both got alond very well, Mr. Leonard teach paul how to play sports, and teach him how to do his work.
when Paul gets the background on Mr.Leonard he is filled with quetions of understanding then he find out Mr. Leonard was exactly like him but Leonard wasn't able to get help with his schooling and ended up flunking out of school and loosing everything he had except his records and Paul in the end went and helped Leonard how to read
The background information you get in this article really helps you understand the story better. It tells you why Mr. Leonard asked the kid for his name at the track, because he couldnt read it on his pass. Him flunking out of college also helped you understand that he wasn't very smart or else he would have graduated from college. Mr. Leonard likes helping Paul in his track because it is something he loves and he also wants to help Paul get better in something so he isnt always last for everything and it would boost Pauls' confidence.
During the story, Paul does not know much about Mr. Leonard. Paul only finds out about him when he talks to the school's track coach. The track coach had told him to visit a website, so Paul did and found out about Mr. Leonard. Paul was surprised that Mr. Leonard had not mentioned it before and asked him what had happened. After Paul found out that Mr. Leonard could not read, he took it upon himself to repay Mr. Leonard for what he had done for him.
Paul is encouraged. After training and learning that Mr. Leonard also could not read, he was encouraged to teach Mr. Leonard to read while Paul himself was being coached. Mr. Leonard knew what Paul was going through which is a reason he had Paul start hurdleing in the first place, and when Paul found out that Mr. Leonard had been in the same boat that Paul was in it made him look at life in a new way.
Mr. Leonard was a tough, stick to the rules kind of man and this made Paul obey him. Paul would never question Mr. Leonard or make rude comments because Mr. Leonard was too stern. In the story it said that Mr. Leonard would stand in the hallways and say, 'Move along, people, move along!' This shows that he was in charge and always followed the rules. Also, Paul had known Mr. Leonard since he started middle school.
He was disturbed that Mr. Leonard didnt tell him that he was a star athlete in track, and was wondering why he didnt tell him.     Mr. Leonard told him to look the coach, and he did, but he looked up Mr. Leonard as well and thats how he learned that he was in college track.
He fineds out that Mr.Leonard it really not what he thinks he is.
Paul finds out about Mr.Leonard's past and is surprised. When Paul asks 'what happened after that?', he is surprised to find out that Mr. Leonard had lost his scholarship and flunked out, all because he had a difficult time reading. This enourages Paul to work hard, and makes him want to help Mr. Leonard the way Mr. Leonard helped him.
Some of the background information the Paul get about Mr. Leonard is shocking to Paul. Seeing this information Paul has a whole new look on Mr. Leonard because he knows that Mr. Leonard would do anything to go back to track.
Paul feels a connection to Mr. Leonard he states that in paragraph 45 sentence 1. They share a bound of having a hard time reading this connects them. Paul then steps up tp teach him how to read in paragraph 46.
The background information about Mr. Leonard shows Paul that he was a former star athlete. This also affects him later when he is told that he dropped out due to his lack of reading skills.
Paul feels motivated to work harder at track because he has good grades and he can read which is something Mr. Leonard never had. Paul, also, is sympathetic for Mr. Leonard and he tells Mr. Leonard it's time for his training as they walk back to the school. Paul is implying he is going to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
That he has trouble with reading, and he goes to the distance learning lab everyday. He has talents that he doesnt know he had.
Paul is not able to read and he is one of a select few in the remedial reading program. Twice a week, he left English class early for the learning center in the basement where he worked with a tutor.
The effects the background information had on paul. Paul could relate to how Mr. Leonard had felt, he was happy that Mr.Leonard had given up his time to help him excel, because he nows what it was like not being able to read.
Mr. Leonard's background is very familiar to Paul. Mr. Leonard had feelings of embarrassment when Paul was called upon to read aloud when Paul didn't know an answer everyone else knew. Mr. Leonard is more closer to another teachers, because he has same experience as Paul.      That is effected Paul's feeling.
The details we receive from reading the story show the reader several things about Mr. Leonard.  The first point which is given to us shows us that Mr.Leonard is a strict man.  However we also read that Mr.Leonard has a softer side to him which he does not show when he works as a hall monitor.  However as the story progresses we continue to show that Mr.Leonard cares about what happens to Paul.  At the end of the story we see the reason why Mr. Leonard cares about Paul.  Mr.Leonard does not want what happened to him also happen to Paul, as Mr.Leonard flunked out of college because he could not read just like Paul.
The background information that Paul gets about Mr. Leonard is shocking. Paul had no clue that he was being coached by one of the greatest freshman college runners ever, as we come to find out in paragraph 38. It also gives Paul a way to help Mr. Leonard, becuase Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard has troubles reading too. Paul starts training Mr. Leonard after he finds out all the information (paragraph 46), this brings the two closer together as friends, since Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard (paragraph 45).
He finds out Mr.Leonard was alot like him in school and has the same reading probelm.
Mr. Leonard couldn't read either and he couldn't get very far in his life. So the narrator has to try harder to accomplish his goals.
The effects on paul was that he didnt know that Mr. Leonard was like that in collage.
Paul can kinda find himself in Mr.Leonard and wants to find more out about him.
He want on doing what
When Paul learns about Mr. Leonard's past, he starts to feel as if he will also be able to go on and have some great achievements in his life. He never thought that he would be able to go to college, but the story of Mr. Leonard shows him that anything is possible if you try your best at everything you do.
The background information that Paul gets about Mr. Leonard gives insight into Mr. Leeonards' life. Paul sees why Mr. Leonard sympathized with him, since they both have a similar problem.
He felt very embarraresed about this situation because the college that he went to turned out to be a disaster. He was very ashamed and did not want to tell anyone that his scholarship got taken away alone them telling him that his grades did not matter. And also he found out that he needed to be tutored.
The effect that paul has when he finds the background information on Mr.Leonard is that he is shocked excited. he also felt closer and more relatable.
I think Paul is shocked too find out that Mr. Leonard broke records. He asked questions about it and seemed very interested.
As Paul learns of Mr. Leonard's past, he is a bit moved. He realizes though he is becoming good at hurdles, he needs to learn to read so he doesn't become like Mr. Leonard. He also realizes then that education comes before athletics. Paul can relate to all of this, because he is in that current situation. In 45 it says, 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well-- feelings of embarrassment when i was called upon to read aloud or when i didn't know an answer everyone else knew. Paul then decides that Mr. Leonard has done him a favor, and has helped him reach a goal... to excel at something. 'This man had given his time to help me excel at something. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him (Line 48). Paul realizes that he needs to excel in academics now, and help Mr. Leonard in the process.
When Paul discovers that Mr. Leonard can not read very well, he probably feels a lot more relaxed.  He knew he didn't have to prove anything to him.  Mr. Leonard understood where Paul was coming from.  It gave him comfort, but Paul still wanted to make Mr. Leonard proud.
The background information surprised Paul, but also made him curious as to why he did not continue to break records. When Paul found out Mr. Leonard also could not read, Paul knew the embarrassment Mr. Leonard felt so he wanted to help him learn to read.
it has a really deep effect on paul because he is starting to become a track star and he doesnt want to go down the same path as mr. leonard. paul also helps mr leonard out with his reading at the end of the passage
The background information has more so of a good effect on Paul. From finding out that Mr. Leonard was a track star and couldn't read, probably made Paul feel as if he can do almost anything. It also probably made Paul want to read, because Mr. Leonard said, 'No other college wanted a runner who couldn't read.' So hopefully that put some type of effort into Paul.
Paul gets to know Mr. Lwonard better throughout the story. I feel like they had a lot in common so they got along well together. They both didn't know how to read and they both could jump hurdles. I think that Paul felt like he wasn't an outcast any more becuase he found someone that was like him in so many ways. I think he found a friend that day.
Paul cant read and so do to that its hard for him to do his work. So he has bad grades and cant make any school sprots team. But Mr.Leonard could help him
Mr.Leonard's background information has alot of impact on Paul mainly because Paul is facing the same problem. Mr. Leonard explains to him that he can be a good athlete but school is important to. Through the teachers past Paul has started to open his eyes.
Mr. Leonard was a great track athelet when he was in college. There was one problem, he also couldn't read. He had broken many records in his college years. He had got kicked out of college becuase he couldn't read. Mr. Leonard had lost all of his scholarships and flucked out. Paul was thinking about that could be him. He was trying to keep this all away from Paul so that he wouldn't start to think that he could also be kicked from school becuase nobody wants a 'runner who cant read'.
Paul knows what its like to not be able to read. So he feels empathy for Mr. Leonard and decides to help him.
The information makes Paul realize that Mr. Leonard needed help with schoolwork to. He found out he was a good hurdeler but couldnt do college work and wanted to help him.
The fact that Mr. Leonard dropped out of college and lost his scholarship because he couldn't read really effects Paul because he to cannot read very well.
He ws shocked at first because he didn't think that Mr.Leonard could've ben a track star. But then he is more understanding as he finds out that he couldn't read. He is also inspired to help Mr.Leonard with reading because he had helped Paul with getting into track and wanted to help him back.
The background information about Mr. Leonard makes Paul somewhat confused at first, because he does not know why he would hide his past of being a track star. After Mr. Leonard tells Paul the whole story, Paul is empathetic with Mr. Leonard's situation because he is in a similar situation, and decides to help him with his past.
Paul feels like he is in Mr. Leonard's shoes when he was younger. In the story Paul states,'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.' This gave Paul motivation to achieve something for not only himself but Mr. Leonard who was not able to achieve much in school.
Paul is very thankful towards Mr. Leonard for helping him get faster. Paul says in the passage, 'It's time to start your training.' this is a way that paul can help Mr. leonard on his reading and to repay him for what he done for him. the background information helps paul realize that not everyone is the same, and that he isn't the only person that can't read. Mr. Leonard gave paul some confidence.
When Paul figures out that Mr. Leonard was a great athlete in high school and in college but did poorly academicly it encouraged him to try his best. Paul found out that Mr. Leonard was one of the best hurdlers, but when he lost his scholarship because he couldn't read no other school wanted him, even though he was one of the best. This showed Paul that even though you could be one of the best at a sport it doesn't matter if you don't have the grades.
The effect that the background information about Mr. Leonard had on Paul was great for Paul and Mr. Leonard.  Paul realized that he could do something he never thought of doing with the help of Mr. Leonard.  Paul wanted to help Mr. Leonard, just like Mr. Leonard helped him.
The background information makes Paul relate more to Mr. Leonard. Paul had felt the embarassment that Mr. Leonard had felt. Such as when Paul was asked to come up to the front of the class to read. Paul realised that his life was a flashback for Mr. Leonard and his difficult school life.
When Mr. Leonard hands Paul the URL, and Paul looks him up, he realizes something important. Mr. Leonard and Paul had something in common. They both struggled with reading. Mr. Leonard saw an opportunity to help Paul achieve his goals, and he took that opportunity.     Obviously, when Mr. Leonard looked at Paul, he saw himself as a child. He remembered what it was like to be in his position. So, Paul was blessed to have someone like him to help. Paul realizes that just because he is chosen last for teams, and he is unable to read, doesn't mean he is unable to do other important things. Mr. Leonard proudly accepts the opportunity to help Paul so he could achieve his dreams.
THAT MR. LEONARD WANT TO COLLEGE AND RUN TRACK AND FIELD AND THAT HE SHOULD COACH IT.
When Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a runner also he is very surprised. Paul first wants to know why Mr. Leonard did not tell him about it. 'Why didn't you tell me about this?' Paul knows exactly what Mr. Leonard went through because he is going through the same thing. Paul knows exactly how it feels to be embarrassed because he can't read. 'The emotions in Mr. Leonards words were all too familiar to me.' Paul feels bad for Mr. Leonard and wants to help him.
After Mr. leonard helps paul become a great runner he went and talked to the rack coach. He soon found out that Mr. leonard was an amazing runner and even got a scholarship for it. the effect of learning Mr. Leonard was a great runner was that he really knew what he was doing and taught paul very well. Paul also learned that without education its hard to keep your dreams alive. If Mr. Leonard would have known to read he could have made even more records to beat.
While training with Mr. Leonard, Paul learns more about him and his past. Paul learns that Mr. Leonard is not just a hall monitor, in fact Mr. Leonard was a track star who broke records and recieved a college scholorship. Paul also learns that Mr. Leonard wasn't the best student and eventually flunked ou tof college because of his grades.      As Mr. Leonard is telling Paul about his past Paul understands the feelings of embarassment and was empathetic towards Mr. Leonard. Paul is in a similar situation as Mr. Leonard; however Paul recieves helps from the school's reading center. Paul empathy causes him to realize that he should help mr. Leonard like Mr. Leonard helped him.
He learns that paul is a good kid, that can pick things up quick. So he help him by learning one thing, so that he can learn how to read better
When Paul recieves information about Mr. Leonard he is surprised that Mr. Leonard never mentioned it to him. He was somewhat in awe of Mr. Leonard for his achievements, and even more so for his will to help people like him.
It suprises paul and makes him want to work harder and makes him sympathetic.  In the last paragraph, paul wants Mr. Leonard to start training.  Paul also is a little confused on how Mr. Leonard didnt make it as a runner.  In paragraph 43, paul mentions that Mr. Leonard went to colleage.
The effect that background information has on Paul is it made him want to help Mr. Leonard learn to read and for him to never give up. After Paul found out about Mr. Leonard, he remembered how embarrassed he always feels because he cannot read. Paul feels like he relates to Mr. Leonard in that way because they both have obstacles they need to overcome. Paul now understands and wants to help Mr. Leonard learn to read. Also, Mr. Leonard's background has taught Paul to never give up learning because he can overcome it and become successful.
The background effects Paul because Paul had no idea he was learning from a champion. They both shared something and helped eachother all the way through.
The background information presented about Mr. Leonard is effective in the fact that Paul can realize his own true potential.      In the story, Paul not only learns about Mr. Leonard's past as a track 'star', but also about his stuggles with learning. This information motivates Paul because he realizes that he has more opprotunities than Mr. Leonard ever did and that even though Mr. Leonard was a good athlete, his school work was more important; grades really do matter.      This information also helps Paul realize that Mr. Leonard and him share a connection. Through this connection, they can both help each other out.
The background information the reader gets effected Paul by motivating him. He felt as if everyone has a strong point and that everyone deserves help in something no matter what it is. Also, it makes him feel like everything gets better with practice.
The effect that background information about Mr. Leonard was a shock to him. Mr. Leonard never did think that Paul would do research about him from his past. From the story it says 'He looked at me quizzically, then smiled sadly at the image on the page.' Mr. Leonard was very speechless because what Paul showed him, brought back a big memory of Mr. Leonard.
The backround information had a big effect on Paul.  Paul felt more comfortable an he understood Mr. Leonard more, after he found out the information.
Paul was suprized at what Mr Leonard has acomplished in college even though he flunked out.
he was a good track runner in his day.
pau obey leonard. so that is why he listenings to him alot. and look up to leonard.
He learns that Mr. Leanard was a great track runner for his college, that he even broke records. Paul feels more conected to Mr. Leonard because he too can't read.
Both Mr. Leonard and Paul were not very good students in school. Mr.Leonard was amazying in track but since he did not get good grades in class he lost he scholarship and flunked out of school. Paul is not very good in class either. When Mr.Leonard helps him learn how to jump hurtles good he had him go out for the boy track them. In a way they are exactly the same.
When Paul is told to look up Mr. Leonard, he finds out that he was a track star and was a college freshmen who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals.  Paul also finds out that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college and lost his scholarship because he couldn't read.  Paul sees that he's not alone and can relate to someone about not being able to read.  Mr. Leonard is very supportive and Paul is no longer embarrased about his situation.
The background effects Paul by slowly showing him that he is being taught by one of the greats and, he can over come his objectives.
Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard had won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals, yet he had to drop out because of his lack of intellegence. This helps paul to connect more to his coach and want to work hard for Mr. Leonard, and have Mr. Leonard work hard for him.
The information that Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard is the he used to be an amazing college athlete who broke many records, he found this out by typing in the URL that the track coach had given him. When he saw what a great athlete Mr. Leonard was he confronted him about it. When he questioned Mr. Leonard about his athletic career he also found out that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college because he struggled in school, mainly because he could not read. That's when eveythign clicked for Paul. He understood why Mr. Leonard was excited about Paul going to the learning center, why he wanted to help him run hurdles, why he asked him his name, and Paul knew how he could help Mr. Leonard in return. Just like Mr. Leonard had helped Paul jump his hurdles, he was going to return the favor.
Paul discovers that Mr. Leonard had once ran track at a college level.  Mr. Leonard raced his way to several records then, but Paul didn't know why Mr. Leonard had quit. Paul is motivated by Mr. Leonards story of not learning how to read and balancing school and sports.
Paul seems to be compassionate with Mr. Leonard in the story as he finds out Mr. Leonard could not read either. Mr. Leonard explained how he had to rely on his friends for homework help and Paul immediately felt empathy towards him.
Paul is surprised to learn that Mr. Leonard was a star in college in hurdling and that he had won 400 titles.It makes Paul compare himself to Leonard since they were having the same kind of problems in life.It makes Paul want to struggle hard and believe he can achieve much in life despite the fact that he was not good academically.
because Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to the narriator.
The background information on Mr. Leonard is very important because it explains why Mr. Leonard is trying to make sure Paul can get better at being aan athelete.
The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to Paul. The feelings of embarrassment when Paul was called upon to read aloud or when  he didn't know an answer everyone else knew.
When Paul found out Mr. Leonard was a track star and a good athlete in college, but lost his scholarship because he was not a good student, Paul started to relate to Mr. Leornard. He felt like they had the same flaws and problems. Mr. Leonard helped Paul excel in track and jumping hurdles, and Paul felt as if it was only fair if he helped Mr. Leonard to read because Paul knew what it felt like to be embarrassed to read aloud in front of people.
He feels sorry for Paul for having struggles with reading because My. Leanard knows exactly how it felt to succeed so well at something but in the same aspect he was not a good student and no school wanted an athlete who could not read. He did not want Paul to go through the same expierience he did with being so talented, but the difficulties with reading held him back from being able to do what he was good at.
Paul gets on the computer and finds out htat Mr. Leonard has many track records from when he went to school and wonders why he is a hall monitor and why Mr. Leonard didnt tell him about his records.
Paul is stunned on how good Mr. Leonard did on his track and feild team. But is also wondering why he gave it up.
At first Paul just sees Mr. Leonard as the hall monitor in his school. Then when the track coach tells him to search the hall monitor on a track and feild website he finds out that Mr. Leonard was a running star when he was young and also by asking Mr. Leonard he finds out that he cannot read just like Paul. It gives Paul a whole new perspective on Mr. Leonard because he then understands that the reason Mr. Leonard is helping him is that he was just like Paul at that age and he can relate to him.
The background information had a negative effect on Paul. Paul saw that he was an amazing track runner, but now he's just a hall monitor. What happened to his big chance in a good carer? So it kinda gave Paul a loss in hope for sucess.
Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a great athlete in college and that he had broken many track records, while winning nationals. So, Paul then knew that he had been coached by a great athlete. He then finds out that Mr. Leonard wasn't such a good student, and that he flunked out of college. This reminded him of himself, he was good at running but not too good at school. After finding that out, he wants to help Mr. Leonard how to read, just like Mr. Leonard taught him how to do hurdles.
The background information that Paul finds about Mr. Leonard make him feel closer to him as a person. He understands his feelings and he understands his past because he has been through things similar to what Mr. Leonard has experienced.
The highschool trach coach handed Paul a URL for the internet to visit.  Paul printed out the page from the internet and handed it to Mr. Leonard.  The URL happened to be about Mr. Leonard's past.  He happened to be a record breaking track star as a freshman, but then he flunked out of college.  This forms a unique bond between Paul and Mr. Leonard because they both struggle with school and reading.  At the end, Paul says, 'It's time to start your training'(paragraph 46).  This shows that Paul is grateful for Mr. Leonard coaching him and bringing joy to an area of his life he had yet to feel.  In return, Paul is willing to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
He found out that Mr. Lenoard is not doing well in some things. He did not go to college thinking that he would flunk it so that is the reason why.
The coach gives Paul a website to go to. On the website he finds out about Mr.leonard being a college runner in the 400 meter hurdles. The next day he goes to the hall moniter and ask why he never went anywhere pulling out the print off. He simply replied in sorrow he couldnt read. This inspired paul knowing that Mr. leonard took the time out of his day to help him that's why paul is hepling him learn to read.
The first information that Paul learns about Mr. Leonard is that he is a hall monitor whose job it is to keep things moving. The effect of this information is that when Mr. Leonard coaches Paul in track, Paul obeys because that is what he is used to doing when Mr. Leonard tells him to do something. Later, Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a track star while he was a freshman in college, and that his career came to a halt due to the fact that he was not a talented reader. Paul's learning of this new information ignites empathy in him and makes him feel like he and Mr. Leonard are not all that different. Paul is getting better at reading by visiting the learning center, and it is implied that he would like to give this same gift to Mr. Leonard. Paul's newfound knowledge of Mr.Leonard's background evokes this generosity.
Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard is a lot like him.  They both can't read but are willing to try and get better at anything.  At the end of the story, Paul tells Mr. Leonard, 'It's time to start your training.'
Mr.Leonard was a track star back in his day.paul whats to be goood at something in his life like Mr. Leonard.
I think that paul can really do what he want if he just set his mind to it and he can be anything he want. But i also,think he can be a runer.
When Paul reads background information on Mr. Leonard, he is shocked to see that he had won the 400 meter hurdles and broke records. He wondered why Mr. Leonard hadnt told him his past in the first place.
The effect is embarrassment and and sadness. Here are details from the story. 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well-feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew.'
Paul relizes that he is not alone and has a coach who delt with the same things as he currently is. Paul is suprised when he first finds out and then when Mr. Leonard tells him more of the story he understands why he is helping him.
When Paul recieves the informaton on Mr. Leonard, he feels as if he is in the same boat as him. Paul feels like he can relate to him in a way that he never has before. In the story, Paul is confused when Mr. Leonard asks his name after seeing all the hall passes. But after he finds out that he can't read, he wants to start training Mr. Leonard so that he can appreciate what he had done for Paul during the track season.
Paul learned beckground information about Mr. Leonard that was revelant to his own life. Paul learned that Mr. Leonard was a great hurdler but was awful at reading. Paul also learned that Mr. Leonard failed out of college for not being able to read. Paul knows that he is not very good at reading and being in this remedial program will help him learn to read better and maybe one day he will go to college for hurdles but not fail out.
It makes Paul curious. You can tell this because he asks Mr. Leonard why he he had not ever mentioned it to him. Another reason you can tell it makes him curious is because Paul asks other questions about Mr.Leonards past like 'What Happened.'
It makes paul ask why Mr. Leonard did not tell him this
Paul feels bad for Mr. Leonard because he has the same problems as him. At the end of the story, Paul says to Mr. Leonard, indirectly, that he was going to help him learn how to read.
Paul sees that Mr. Leonard was an amazing athlete, but his athletic career was takin away from him because of his grades. Mr. Leonard had lost his scholarship and flunked out of college. Paul is intrigued to hear this and it makes him want to do better as a student and as an athlete.
Before Paul knew of Mr. Leonards disability he had just thought of him as some one who didnt know what they were talking about. That Mr. Leonard didnt really understand who Paul was and didnt understnd Pauls' disabilities.            After reading the passage Paul realized that Mr. Leonard had full empathy for him and uunderstood Paul to the fullest. Mr. Leonard then had a bigger empact on Paul because now Paul sees what he can become,and what he has to do to become whatver it is that he wants.
I believe that the information that he learns about Mr. Leonard makes him have a very close connection with him. He realizes that his life is a lot like Mr. Leonard's life but that he has a chance to change his future.
The effect the background information has on paul is that he will probly work harder on his reading so he wouldnt end up like Mr. Leonard and loose his scholarship.
because he wamted to learn evreything that was going on with him. to get a better feel
because things where different in college and evrything.
when Mr.Leonard staredmiddle school he new Mr.Paul as a hall monitor whoes job it was to keep students movieung along form on class to another. mr.leonard cant reade ether.
Paul finds reading hard; so does Mr. Leonard. When Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a track star, but couldn't read, this reminded him that he couldn't read. If Mr. Leonard could read, but can be a track star, then Paul can work on his reading and become a track star. Mr. Leonard's history shows Pail what he can become.
It gives Paul modivation to excel in the hurdles and also to help Mr. Leonard in areas he struggled with to.  The background information also gives Paul a feeling of embarrassment when he was called to read aloud or when he didn't know an answer everyone else knew.  He then realizes that Mr. Leonard is helping him to excel in something to make him feel important.
When Paul got background information on Mr. Leonard that effected Paul to, feel like he isn;t the only one that has a reading problem at school and couldnt read that well. And it also made him feel just like Mr. Leonard, because he was always pick lasted for a team so he also started training and got really good at sports so he wasnt chosed last anymore.
When Paul finds out the background information about Mr. Leonard, Paul seems more interested in him. Paul asks questions about his past and why he didn't go further with his talent. When Mr. Leonard tells Paul about his past, it shows a connection between the two and shows Paul that he can be successful in life.
Paul is very shocked by what he see's on the internet about Mr. Leonard. It also encourages Paul to good in track and in school now, because he has seen what happened to Mr. Leonard by not being able to read.
The background information on Mr. Leonard effects Paul by helping Paul recognize that Mr. Leonard never learned well and he needed Learning Centers. Mr. Leonard was a good athlete but he was never an exceptional learner, through this, Paul gained the need to help Mr. Leonard learn.
The effects it has on Paul are sad, he didnt know that Mr. Leonard failed college. Mr. Leonard felt ashamed which made Paul want to do good.
Mr.Leonard and Paul both had something in common, they had a hard time reading. When Paul ran into Mr.Leonard in the hallway he asked for his pass and asked were he was going, Paul told Mr.Leonard he was going to learn to read because he couldnt. Mr.Leonard eased up and let him go through as if he knew what he was talking about. Now Mr.Leonard is their track couch and Paul is very good now just like Mr.Leonard was.
He is shocked and can't believe he was in college for hurdles. Also he didn't know why he didnt tell him before.' why didnt you tell me about this before?'
That Mr. Leonard was a Collage track super star and he broke records. It had a negative and a postive effect on Paul. It put him down that the man who had been helping him had not told him that he was a track star, but it also helped him when he confronted Mr. Leonard about it.
When Mr. Leonard told him about is college days paul wanted him to coach and train him, because he was a good coach to him. Paul felt the same when Mr. Leaonard told him about is past about no being able to read, so paul wanted to work hard to know how to read so he could go to college and run track.
It makes Paul seem more able to read by using an adult who has trouble reading as another example. It also makes paul feel less inferior to Mr. Leonard. At the end of the story Paul makes a statement that begins the idea that Paul then helps Mr. Leonard with reading.
It show Paul that people aare like him so there is more than a select few. It can be Paul being just like Mr. Leonard so if he becomes a better reader he can go on to college and do great things.
I believe that the background information Paul receives effects Paul in such a way that he feels inspired, encouraged and feels like the sky is his limit.
After Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a major track star in college along with finding out that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college because he could not read, this inspired Paul to help Mr. Leonard. After Paul and Mr. Leonard talked about Mr. Leonards college accomplishments, Paul thought of an idea. Paul was going to go help teach Mr. Leonard how to read since Mr. Leonard helped Paul with running track and becoming faster and more athletic.
When Paul finds out the Mr. Leonard was a champ track runner in his college days his becomes curious as to why he would quit if he had goen as far as setting records. He soon finds out that Mr. Leonard also could not read, just like Paul. This made Paul think that Mr. Leonard had helped him so now it's time to return a favor and tell him to 'C'mon, it's time to start his training' as he walks towards the school.
He discovers that Mr.leonard is is just like he is. He relizes that not beening able to read is not a bad thing.
Mr. Leonard was a good athlete, but poor student. His college work was harder than high school work, so he lost his scolarship and dropped out. He said the coach did not want a runner that could not read.
He wants to be like Mr. Leonard and be a track star. He wants to be smart and able to read.
In the story our narrator Paul finds some background information on Mr. Leaonard. This information impacts Paul greatly in the story. His attitude and the way he sees things change completely.     When Paul had said 'I knew the well--feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read alouf or when I didn't know an answer everone else knew.' Paul understands how Mr. Leonard felt about not knowing what it was like to not be the best student in the world and having to get help from people. Paul feels for Mr. Leonard and he sympathizes for him.     Pauls attitude changes dramatically when he says 'It's time to start your training.'. Now the Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard can not read he wants to help him out to repay him for helping him find his secret talant.
When Paul found out that Mr.Leonard was a good track star and that he didn't go to college because he couldn't read, it reminded Paul of his self.
Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard was once very famous and good at track and he now understand that he wants Paul to follow in his footsteps in a sense. Mr. Leonard also is not good at school like Paul and wants to give Paul something that he can be good at and feels that track could be great for Paul.
The background information effects Paul because it makes Paul want to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read. When Paul figured out that Mr. Leonard was a track star during college, by the URL given to him by the track coach, he acts suprised and decides to help Mr. Leonard learn to read.
Paul most likely now understands why Mr. Leonard is encouraging him to do the races, and wants him to go to college and graduate.
Mr. Leonard was a star track runner and a horrible reader too.
The background information about Mr.Leonard effects Paul by showing him and inspiring him with a story that is somewhat similar to his own. He knows that Mr.Leonard and himself have things incommon. They are both very bad readers and are good at running hurdles.
Paul understood better why Mr. Leonard took care of Paul. When Paul told Mr. Leonard he couldn't read, that was a sign right there that he was going to look after him and make him a star. With this back ground information, Paul felt more emotionally connected to Mr. Leonard because he went through the exact same things in his life. He felt like there was someone else out there, and this man was just trying to help Paul succeed at something.
The background information has a big effect on Paul. It motivates Paul to do even better, since him and Mr. Leonard had similar problems in school.
The background information that Mr. Leonard has on paul would make him feel sometype of sympathy for him. It would make him work harder and do better to get paul on track.
The effect that background information has on Paul is that he now feels connected to Mr. Leonard because they both went through the same thing in not being able to read very good. Paul knows exactly what it felt like to not be able to read.
The information he finds about Mr. Leonard effects him alot because he relizes how much they are alike to eachother. They both have reading disabilities and he is trying to help him to get over that and not to affect him. Mr. Leonard gets him on the track and trains him because that is what he used to do and he wants to pass it on.
Paul feels sympathetic for Mr. Leonard when he finds out that Mr. Leonard can not read. I suspect that this is because Paul could not read very well. Paul states 'The emotions in Mr. Leonards words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well-feelings of embarassment when I was called when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didnt know an answer everyone else knew.' Paul knows that this was the way that Mr. Leonard felt in high school and college.
He realizes the importance of working hard, learning to read and doing well in school. He handed the print out of the web page to Mr. Leonard and ask him what happened to him and Mr. Leonard told him his story. At that moment Paul realized that reading and graddes were important and Mr. Leonard didn't want him to suffer the same way he did.
I believe that gives Paul, the narrator, and the reader background because it shows us how important that education is but to Paul it's someone he can look at and understand. It gives a sence of companionship with others because he is slower at reading so are others. He is not alone. It also tells Paul that he can be good at things even if he is not so great at reading. That is why i believe that it gives background information.
PAUL SEES THAT JUST BECAUSE YOU CANT DO SOMETHING RIGHT YOU CAN WORK HARD TO OVERCOME ANY OBSTACLE.
Mr. Leonard asking the narrator has set Paul into the right frame of mind by knowing that life always has obstacles. Paul also relized that Mr. Leonard was always there to help and making Paul motivated to read. Everyone knows that reading is something you need to do not maybe want to do.
Paul realized that even though your not good at one thing that you can't be good at something else. Just like when Paul talks about he knows the feeling of embarrassment when he was called upon to read aloud or when he did'nt know an anwser everyone else knew. Paul realized Mr. Leonard gave his time to help him excel at something and that its okay to not be good at something you just have to work at it harder.
Mr. Leonard's past motivates Paul to succed and do his best in reading and hurrdiling as well, 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well-feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew. This man had given his time to help me excel at somethng. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.'
The effect of this was to show that the hall monitor was not just a hall monitor but a record breaking track runner. Also so that the boy could think he could do the same the man did but this time graduate from college because he will be able to read and write.
It reminds him of himself and makes him think he will turn out just like Mr. Leonard. Mr. Leonard couldn't read and flunked out of college and since Paul can't read either he probably thinks that he will end up doing the same and flunking out of college.
He finds out that Mr. Leonard and Paul both have problems reading so he feels better about him self.
Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a great track star yet flunked out of collage because he couldnt read. 'no other school wanted a runner who couldnt read.'
he got upset cause he never told him
Before learning of Mr. Leonard's background, Paul is ashamed by his inabiliy to read.  Once Mr. Leonard gets Paul running track and builds his confidence Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard use to be a track star.  When Paul questions Mr. Leonard about his previous track experience in college he learns that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college after his freshman year, due to reading and homework troubles.  Paul realizes that he his not alone in this world and that others struggle the same way he does.  'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.'  He also learns that just because he struggles in school doesn't mean he can't succeed with his dreams; he just has to work hard and have the right demeanor.
Paul actually wants to do this now that he knows Mr. Leonard was a hurdler himself and that he flunked out of college. An example from the story was when he thought to his self that the emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me . I knew them well, feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew. This man had given his time to help me excel at something. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.
The efect that Mr. Leonards has on Paul is that he is in the same position as Mr. Leonard and he does not want to take the same route as Mr. Leonard and ruin the chances of having something good going for him.
When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard's past he is interested and wants to know more. Once Mr. Leonard explains what happens Paul understands. 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me,' is what went through his mind. This encourages Paul to help Mr. Leonard learn to read.
Paul learned that Mr. Leonard was a track star who also couldn't read. His inability to read made life a lot more difficult for him; more difficult than it was for all of the other people that had gone to school with him. Paul, who also couldn't read, felt close to Mr. Leonard. He felt empathetic; he understood the hall monitor's emotions completely. He could identify with the embarrassment he felt.     Mr. Leonard had given Paul hope; he had shown him about hurdles and taught him how to jump over them efficiently and effectively. Eventually, Paul was able to join the track team. It had given him the chance to excel at something like never before. After hearing Mr. Leonard's story, he felt as though he should give back. After the story ends, it's clear that Paul is helping to teach Mr. Leonard how to read so that he too could feel accomplished with himself.
He was amazed by his accomplishments and wondered why even though he went to college he had problems with school work.
M.r. Leonard feel s that paul is just like him in ways.  He couldnt read so he had to flunk out of college and he didnt want that to happen to paul.
It in a way gives him confirmation on why Mr.Leonard did the things that he did. And why he had taken a liking to Paul becasue when Mr.Leonard was younger he was alot like Paul, so i can only figure that it helpred Mr.Leonard move on from the past because he seen so much of himself in Paul.
It makes him feel discouraged and angry. Paul is upset because he cant do something that leonard can do.
The effect on the background that he has on Paul was because on lines 3 and 4 Mr.Leonard talks and says 'Hey my friend where do you think you are going' Then Paul says the 'Learning Center' then he tells him that he can't read and later finds out that he excels in track later in the story.
The background information Paul learned form Mr.Leonard made a diffrence. Once Paul learns that Mr.Leonard had been in hurdles in high school and that had broke records he asked Mr.Leonard why? Then Mr.Leonard explains everything. Just like Paul he had also been good in hurdles, and  had trouble reading. Though it didn't seem like a problem then. His college scouts told him that they weren't important but by the time he got to college he realized grades were important. Not being able to read he flunked college and lost his scholarship.This made Paul think of all what Mr.Leonard had done for him. Since he was going through the same. He was good in a sport but not so good as a student. Then realizes Mr.Leonard does this to help other students.
Mr. Leonard was a big time runner in his college days, but was unable to learn anything while in college. As a result Mr. Leonard was thrown out of college and no other school would take him, because even though he was a good runner he wasn't well educated which was not tolerated. This is seen as a big incouragement for Paul, seeing as how he is blossoming into a good athlete and is also slowly getting his education, that he can accomplish things when he tries. Also Paul would be motivated to become better jumping and try to learn more to make Mr. Leonard proud of him and possibly accomplish what Leonard couldn't.
Paul was effected by Mr.Leonard, because Paul knew how it feel to be embarrassed. For example in the story the author stated ' I knew them well-feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when i idin't know an answer everyone else knew.' This statement shows Paul understood how Mr.Leonard felt. Therefore, Paul was effected by Mr.Leonard background.
Paul is concerned about Mr. leonard that why didn't he finish college and why didn't he tell him that he was a star athlete on hurdlers
Paul likes to incourage people to do better.
As long as Paul had known Mr. Leonard, he was a hall monitor. This made Paul respectful and obedient to him. That not only extended in school halls but also in atheletics. The next peice of backround information Paul learns about Mr. Leonard, is that Mr. Leonard was a track star. This simply increases the respect he has for him. In the story, Paul didn't appear to be upset that Mr. Leonard hadn't told him about his past, he treated him the same but seemed to appriciate him more. The last peice of information Paul learned about Mr. Leonard was that he couldn't read. Many kids would simply make fun if an adult was illiterate, but Paul can simpathize. He understands how difficult it can be to learn to read and embraces and helps Mr. Leonard to read.
During this story, Paul learns backround information about Mr. Leonard that really surprises him. This information shows Paul that even though you may be good at something, for example a sport, school work and your education always comes first. Now, Paul will really work hard on learning how to read. He doesn't want to let Mr. Leonard, or himself down.
The background information has a huge affect on Paul because Mr. Leonard was trying to help Paul be as good as he was at hurdles.  Mr. Leonard wanted someone that never did anything and was working hard for his grades.When Mr. Leonard found out that Paul was learning how to read, Mr. Leonard took that as an oppurtunity to help Paul achieve in something that he once had.
Paul doesn't feel as embarrased to know his coach struggled with reading too.
Paul was curious as to why Mr.Leonard had never mentioned of his running past. He seemed proud of him that he had accomplished something so great and had something to his name. When Paul found out the reasoning that Mr.Leonard had for what happened, he felt for  him. Paul knew exactly how Mr.Leonard felt, the embarrasment, the lack of knowledge while everyone else had the answer, he could truly relate to him.      It occured to Paul, that in the same way Mr.Leonard had approached him, and helped him out with athletics and doing something for himself, he was gonna help Mr.Leonard do the same. Paul wanted to be able to offer his services to him by helping him improve his reading skills. And while helping him, it would also improve Paul's reading skills.
When Paul realizes that his everyday coach and hall monitor was truely a great college track runner, Paul was stunned. Paul had been interacting with Mr. Leaonard everyday without knowing his true background. Paul is surprised about Mr. Leonard's background and then goes on to ask him various questions.
The background information that Paul finds about Mr. Leonard gives him a curious feeling. He wondered what happened to Mr. Leonard. As it turns out Mr. Leonard can't read which is the same problem that Paul had which caused the two to meet. Since Mr. Leonard taught Paul how to run hurdles Paul felt he should teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
The effect on Paul from raeding Mrs. Leonard explains that paul can do anything you want as long as you have the knoweledge and the education. Because you can be good at anything but if you dont have no education what can you do with out it.
HE it makes him like Mr. Leonard more. When he finds out that he was a track star and very good he shows the coach more understanding as to why he made him do track. When he learns that Mr. Leonard cant read he becaomes more sympathetic towards him.
It has a positive effect on Paul. It makes him want to strive to be better than Mr. Leonard.
The information he fount on Mr. Leonard had a good effect on Paul because he didnt know Mr.Leonard ran track in his freshmen year in college. He was inspired by it and the fact that Mr.Leonard was inspiring him to run track and to have his education.
Paul feels a relation between himself and Mr. Leonard. They both can't, or have trouble, reading. Plus they are both track hurdlers too. Therefore when he (Paul) learns of Mr. Leonard's past he feels a relation between them.
He isn't really affected by it.  He was just curious as to why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about it.  Paul may have been a little hurt, but I don't think it really surprised him that much.  Paul was understanding when Mr. Leonard told him why, and wanted to help him.
Paul is very impressed about what he hears about Mr. Leonard. The next day he asks him why he never told paul that he was such a good college hurdler. Paul wondered why he didnt continue to run after college since he was so talented and Mr. Leonard told him it was because his grades were too bad and no college wanted a runner that couldnt read so they took his scholarship away.
Mr Leonard did a great job when he was on track. But became very discouraged after attending a college and not knowing how to read. He later dropped out because no college wanted a athlete that wasnt able to read. He explained his past to the narrator to show him that he should never give up. And he did that by encouraging the narrator that he is very lucky to be at a school that is willing to offer certain programs.
Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard's past from the high school track coach.  He is surprised by the janitor's previous experiences.  You know that he surprised because, he confronts him about it.  When he finds out Grabowski can not read he feels the need to help he shows that by tellinghim it is time to start training you.
It surprises him, but he is more determined to help Mr. Leonard and do better himself. Paul sees the person that helped him not do so well in school so it would shock and surprise him. He is more determined to help Mr. Leonard out since Mr. Leonard helped him out. He knows what Mr. Leonard feels like since he has gone through some of the same situations.
Pauls more aprehensive to learn. Hes confident that learning to read will be easier now because if tracks easy then so is school. And it theres people like him then hes not so ashamed.
Paul was honored to be trained by a college athlete. When he found out that Mr. Leonard also couldn't read, he understood how his coach felt. He also felt that he owed Mr. Leonard something for teaching him how to run hurdles, so he offered to help the coach with reading.
Paul wants to learn how to run faster for the high school track. and he run every day with Mr. Leonard and Mr.Leonard wants to lit him tran for high school because he will be good and faster they another kis. Mr.leonard shows the boy something how to stay and shape.
Paul could be good at sport than Mr. Leonard.
When Paul does a background check on Mr. Leonard he realizes that Mr. Leonard was the same way he was back in school. He wants to make something of himself instead of being a hall monitor in a middle school someday.
I believe that when Paul knows the truth about Mr. Leonard, he is more motivated to start learning and willing to work harder on hurdling. His relationship with Mr. Leonard also increases and he comes to respect him.
Well Mr Leonard was Paul Teacher and everybody would always make fun of him because he wasnt good at sports or anything so his teacher decides to put me in sports like basketball and track he would like jump over the hurdles like it wasnt nothing and his coach was like nice job kid i hope you do good when your playing baskaetball so he lefted english to go to a learning center to get helped and work out for the basketball and track and everybody that was in the school were like good job kid im proud of you so then the kids were jealous and mad because he would do something right that his coach would tell me
The background information helps Paul acheive his goals. Paul took his training lessons from Mr. Leonard and became good at doing the hurdles in track. Even though Paul couldn't read he still wanted to do few things to accomplish in his life. He may of been going into the Learning Center but that doesn't stop you from doing well in other acheivements. Paul learned alot from his coach and taught him how to be better than what Paul had realized he was.
The background that Mr. Leonard gives Paul. Makes Paul think that they are the same because they both can't read. Mr. Leonard and Paul are both good at hurddles.
Paul was surprised, and kind of angry that Mr. Leonard didnt tell him sooner.
The narrator is surprised at the information. He never expected that Mr. Leonard was a track star.
The background information that Paul finds out helps Paul know that he can become an athlete too. It also proves that Paul can go to college even though he can't read. Mr. Leonard went to college and was a good athlete even though he couldn't read.
When paul recieved the background information he had questions for Mr. leonard. Paul wondered
Because Paul learned that Mr. Leonard had been a great athlete, but flunked out of school because he was unable to read, he had common ground built with Mr. Leonard. That knowledge of what had happened to Mr. Leonard impacted Paul to start working harder, because Mr. Leonard had told him how hard things got after high school.
Mr.Lenorad lets Paul know he was flunked out of college for not being able to read. This effects Paul because he is in the same situation at school because he cant read as well but Mr. Leonards lets him know thats not a problem because Paul has help that mr. leonard didnt have.
Paul comes to find out that Mr.Leonard and himself are the same. They both struggle with reading in high school and in high school is when they found that they love track.
Paul can't believe that Mr. Leonard was a college tract runner. He wants to know why Mr. Leonard didn;t tell him.
During the story, when Paul confronts Mr. Leonard about his past, it becomes apparent that the two are more alike than they had anticipated.  Mr. Leonard too could not read.  The embarassing emotions that Mr. Leonard felt were all too familiar to Paul and gave him a sense of not being alone.  The effect that this information had on Paul was substantial, because it motivated Paul to become a better reader and athlete, not just for his sake, but for Mr Leonard's sake as well.
Teh background information on Mr. Leonard effects Paul by making him realize that other people also share his troubles of not being able to read, even great athletes like Mr. Leonard.
The imformation that Paul get on Mr. Leonard helps him understand why Mr. Leonard is helping him with track.
He wants him to be as good as he can be for the sport that he is going out for and learn as much as he can to be prepared for what he is about to get into he is going out for training to get as good as he can at it
When Paul learns of Mr. Loenard's past, it might have had a positive emotional affect on himself. Paul says in the story that he is a select few who are in the remedial reading program, and from this he may feel embarrased and have low self-esteem. Plus, when talking about how he is picked last in sports doesn't help his esteem either. But when learns of Mr. Leonard who had success in something even though he struggled in school, this may motivate Paul to want to excel at both the hurdles and in school and do what Mr. Leonard could not accomplish.
Paul realizes Mr. Leonard and him are similiar. Paul realizes he doesn't have to be the last person picked in the gym anymore and he can achieve something, and there is hope that he will learn to read and become a great athlete.
He realizes that even if he is not good in school he can still succeed in life. He finds that he just has to find something he is good at, stick with it, and succeed.
The effect that it has on Paul is that he now feels the desire to help out Mr. Leonard since he had takent the time to help him out.  In the story it says, 'This man had given his time to help me excel at something. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.'  This show how he felt the need to return the help.
Leonardo was a hall monitor and he keeped the crowed moving at all times. He never gave up. Paul learned alot from him and he used that in life.
Mr. Leonards background information gives Paul hope in knowing that he can actually great at something since he doesnt know how to read. It also builds up his confidence in learning how to read since Mr. Leonard never learned due to the lacking of a learning center when he was in school. When Paul realizes how much Mr. Leonard and him have in common, it makes him feel alot better that there is someone out there that can relate to him and his problems in life.     Mr. Leonard never learned to read and depended on friends to help him get by even though it was hard. He got into college with a running scholorship for his track and ability to run. He soon realized that the work was alot harded there then it was in high school and eventually flunked out and lost his scholorship. No college would take him after that because they did'nt want a runner that could'nt read.
he noticed that he came from being a very good track coach in a different state.
Paul found out that Mr. Leonard had starred in college track. He broke the college freshman record for the 400 meter hurdles. However, he found out that Mr. Leonard had flunked out of college. Paul realized how lucky he was to be getting help in reading at the learning center. Mr. Leonard's school had not had a learning center, so he never got help with his reading problems. He had great potential in athletics but never got to realize it because of his learning problems. This makes Paul appreciate his tutoring.
When Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard was a good runner but bad reader, he realizes they are alike. It makes Paul want to help Mr. Leonard by teaching him to read and it makes Mr. Leonard to help Paul feel accepted by helping him with track. It also motivates Paul to do better in school so he won't end up flunking.
Mr. Leonard's background information had an effect on Paul because both Mr. Leonard and Paul had the same problem and motivation. Their problem was that both were not very strong at reading, but their strengths, hurdles, is what brought the two together as friends. Since Mr. Leonard had the motivation to teach Paul hurdles, and Paul was willing to learn, Paul could become the new Mr. Leonard, athletically.
He learns that Mr. Leonard is very much like him in the sense that Mr. Leonard isn't a good reader either.  When Mr. Leonard explains to Paul about how he was a good enough athlete to get a scholarship for running track, even though he was not that good in school.  When he explained to Paul that he began letting his lack of knowledge in school effect his persuit of being a runner in college, it helped Paul realize that he could be good at something to balance out his toubles in school, but he must still work hard in school to fully accomplish a goal.  With Mr. Leonard showing Paul how they have a common problem with school and a common interest in jumping the hurdles, Paul was able to apply Mr. Leonard's advice to his own life.
The effect of the background information on Paul is a good thing. The background information makes Paul open his eyes and realize what Mr. Leonard was doing for him. Mr. Leonard did not know how to read and when he found out that Paul did not know how to read he eased up on him. Mr. Leonard coaches Paul how to do hurdles Mr. Leonard sees himself in Paul and knows it is a great thing for him.
When Paul recieves background information about Mr.Leonard, they become more familiar with eachother. Paul Has an inferrior and shy complex as he first interacts with Mr.Leonard. He obeys the comands form his hall monitor, but there was no relationship formed. When Mr.Leonard introduces himself as a concerned adult, Paul still looks up to him. After a relationship is formed with common character traits, and the two characters become on the same level of understanding.
Paul receives information about Mr. Leonard after training with him for some time. After receiving the information, however, Paul now understands why Mr. Leonard wants to help him. Mr. Leonard inspires him to do his best. He sees that having the learning center and trying hard, along with doing sports is a hard task to accomplish. He wants to overcome this task though.
Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a track star as a college freshman. However, because Mr. Leonard struggled with reading and academics, he lost his scholarship and was forced to drop out of school. The fact that Mr. Leonard also struggles academically helps Paul to relate to him. It gives Paul the confidence to embark on a friendship where he and Mr. Leanard can help each other succeed.
Over the course of Paul's encounters with Mr. Leonard, various pieces of information are picked up about the former runner. Its is first revealed that he is has empathy for those struggling in thier lives when he offers to help Paul jump the hurdle in paragraphs 14-23, 'Know what that...Right', I panted'.     The greatest revealation, however, is made when Paul obtains information on Mr. Leonard from his coach in paragraphs 32-33, ' 'Visit this site...with the team'. This makes Paul aware of the strengths and weaknesses that other people have, and how to symphathize with whatever difficulties they experience in their weaknesses.
Paul gets backgroung information abuot Mr. Leonard and effects Paul because he didn't know that Leonard was a hurdle athlete. He said he couldn't read and that he flunked college because of it. Leonard got all emotional and Paul knew how he felt so he said, 'C'mon Mr. Leonard,' 'It's time to start your training.' Paul wanted to help Mr. Leonard and make him feel better.
Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard was just like him and he acomplished something great. It inspires him by showing him that you can accomplish many things even if you aren't great at others.
Paul finds the background information very interresting to him. Paul seems to feel for Mr. Leonard. Paul works hard to and, gets help after school also, going to the learning center for help.      Mr. Leonard tells him how diffrent it was for him back when he was here Pauls age. They didnt have a learning center for him. Mr. Leonard had to go to his friends for help.     This showed Paul that he can do it if Mr. Leonard did. He will just have to work hard at school work and track.
The background information helps Paul understand why Mr. Leonard wanted him to try the hurdles and do well in the remedial reading program. Paul is then very empathetic toward Mr. Leonard and is probably going to try teach him.
The background information about Mr. Leonard has an astronomical effect on Paul. Paul found a new form of respect for Mr. Leonard after reading the background information, which can be infered by Paul's astonishment of Mr. Leonard's accomplishments. Paul now looks up to Mr. Leonard as an idol for jumping hurtles. When Paul learns of Mr. Leonards disability, he wants to help Mr. Leonard in the same way that Mr. Leonard helped him.
The backround check on Mr. Leonard was very suprising to Paul he didnt know that he was a track star at hurdles. Paul went to his computer and went to the schools track and feild website and looked at the history about hurdles and  he saw Mr. Leonard name and it said that he got a full time scholorship for college for hurdles.
Paul did not feel as alone after he discovered that Mr. Leonard had a reading problem in school. Paul was also surprised that Mr. Leonard used to be such a fantastic athlete and wondered why he kept this information from him.
It was explaining that he was a well talented person who wanted to help another out with his talent. When he wasn't doing good in school he was being helped by some tutors that was willing to help him so that he can keep his tallent going.
Mr. Leonard's background information effects Paul. Paul realizes he could be like Mr. Leonard because neither of them ccan read proficently.

As the reader you learn that Mr. Leonard was once a great track star when he was in highschool. Knowing this you can see why he wants to help out the young boy in the story. Then you also learn that he cannot read that well and that he flunked out of collage. Knowing this you can learn more about Mr. Leonard in the fact that he is embarrased with himself and doesnt want the same for the kid
The effect it has on Paul is that he was surprised that the monitor was almost something in life ,but crushed because of something important. He felt lied too just a little bit.
The background information about Mr Leonard is that he had won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals in college. What is surprising about his background information is that he fluncked out and lost his schlaership. Why? Was because he didn't know how to read.
That he was a good athlete, but not a good student. Mr. Leonard won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals.
that paul went to try how hurlding and Mr. leonard said to come on back tomorrow . Mr.leonard was a former track star so paul wanted to try it for him self because Mr. leonard  was a good college track star.But Mr. leonard  could not read and lost his schlorships and flunked college. So i guess paul got inspired by that and went and tried to to do hurlding for track
Paul is affected by the information he finds out about Mr. Leonard in many way. For starters, Paul is somewhat astonished to find that, like him, Mr. Leonard can't read. Paul realizes how lucky he is to have the learning center to help him learn to read. Also, Paul can sympatize with Mr. Leonard, which will make their relationship stronger.
The effect Mr. Leonard's background information has on Paul is that Paul now feels more connected to him. 'I knew them well---feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer anyone else knew.' This quote from the story shows that Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard, and that it has brought them closer together. Paul also felt the need to help Mr. Leonard with reading, as he had helped Paul with track and field from this quote, 'This man had given his time to help me excel at someting. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.'
He realizes that he is the same way when it comes to school. He realizes also that he doesnt need to be booksmart to do things in life..
Paul did not know that Mr. Leonard did not know how to read. Now he feels bad and wants to help him learn to read.
It makes Paul a better student and after he hears the story from Mr. leonard he works even harder and try's harder so that he doesnt let that happen to him.
The eefect the background information that paul found on Mr. Leonard was suprising to him that he was a trck star but yet whe he found out that he couldn't read he felt simpathy for him because in paragraph 45 and 46 he knows the embarassement that he feels of not knowing how to read and figures he can probiabily teach hi how to read.
That why would he be teaching him how to run the hurdles if he was so good and also to ask him why he is the hall monitor for the school, not a track star person.
Paul realizes that he and Mr. Leonard have even more in common than he may have originally thought. When Paul discovers that Mr. Leonard was a college track star, Paul becomes more motivated. This is shown when he asks whether or not he should work out with the team.      When Paul soon discovered that Mr. Leonard can't read and flunked out of college, he is motivated to begin Mr. Leonard's 'training.'
The background information Paul discover schanges his outlook on Mr. Leonard. It pushes him to succeed and show Mr. Leonard how great he can really be.
the effect it has on paul was that it made him curious to know why Mr.Leonard didn't tell him about it and why he quit.
It has a huge effect on Paul and Mr. Leonard. When he first shows Mr. Leonard the url it makes a big impact on  him because paul now knows that he was a major track athlete. Only knowing that he coudnt finish college because he started flunking and not being able to know how to read.     Once Mr. Leonard told paul that, that gave him the motivations to try to be better at the track and to not give up since it reminds him of paul since he coudnt read and he had to go to the learning center twice a week from school.
Paul could relate to what Mr. Leonard went through. Paul knew how it felt to not be able to read, and knew also how it felt to overcome that obstacle. This is shown when it says, 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.'     The learned information also shows Paul finding a sense of leadership and initiative. He not only overcomes his inability to read, but finds an outlet, and takes leadership in both. In running track, he gets on the high school team, and in reading, is able to help Mr. Leonard learn as well.
The information he learned gave him comfidence to help Mr. Leonard just as Mr. Leonard helped him.  Paul tells Mr. Leonard it is time to start training meaning its time to start learning.  Paul also now could relate to Mr. Leonard better.
During the story Paul gets some backround information about Mr. Leonard. Paul learns that Mr. Leonard broke records and was a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals. Paul learns Mr. Leonard was an outstanding athlete, but not a good student. As the story continues, Paul learns that Mr. Leonard could not read and then flunked out of school. Mr. Leonard was very dissappointed in himself and embarassed.
the background information that they had on him was things about when he was in college and he had bad grades and he couldn't go out for scouts.
Paul was suprized that Mr.Leonard never told him about his past,'Why didn't you tell me about this?' He also seemed amazed by everything that Mr.Leonard had done.'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the natuinals.You broke records.'
The background information Paul finds on Mr. Leonard has him feeling both appreciative and sympathetic. Paul feels good because he has been coached by a great national winning hurdler. Also Paul felt good about himself because he was asked to pratice with the track team and he was always bad at sports. On the other hand, Paul was sympathetic for Mr. Leonard for what had happened to him. For example Paul asked, ' Well, what happened after that.' That shows he was curious and cared.
The background infromation shows paul that he can learn how to read. that if he puts his mind to something he can succsed if he tries.
its the fact that they both cant read.
Paul finds out That Mr. Leonard was an old track runner, and that he broke many records. When Paul confronts him, He finds out Mr. Leonard cant read, Like himself.
The background information has an effect of Paul because he gets to know a person better and is therefore not the only one who can't read and feels better.
After Paul researched the background information about Mr.Leonard, he becomes exstatic and excited to be in the precence of a leagend. This is evident when Paul asked why Mr.Leonard had not told him about his acomplishments. This is also evident from the excited way the say that 'you were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nations. You broke records.'
There is a simlairies that Mr.Leonard shaw potential in Paul and wanted Paul to suceed in life ad to be motivated to read so Paul wouldnt end up like Mr. Leonard.
The background information Paul found about Mr. Leonard made him empathetic because he knew exactly how he felt but also he became motiveated to help Mr. Leonard just as he had helped him  with hurdles. 'Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.'
Paul was asked to gym
Seeing that Mr. Leonard had been capable of not only going to college, but braking records in the 400 meter hurdles, influenced him. Paul seen that Mr. Leonard accomplished amazing things in life, and then come to find out he flunked out of college because he couldn't read, influenced Paul even more. Paul was improving more and more each week at running hurdles, so that made him work even harder at becoming a better reader knowing Mr. Leonard had flunked out of college because he couldn't read.
The narrator is, in a way, just like Mr. Leonard. He will want to get better at reading and stay in school so he can go on with track through college.
Paul was surprised to see that the hall monitor, Mr. Leonard had been an exceptional collegiate athlete. He also wondered why he doesn't run anymore so he went to confront Mr. Leonard about it and asked, 'Well, what happened after that?' and he said, ' I lost my scholarship and flunked.'
The background information of Mr. Leonard effects Paul in a positive way. When Paul finds out the Mr. Leonard was also a great hurdler, but flunked out of college for not being able to read, it shows him that he can overcome even the biggest obstacles. Paul is a little shocked when Mr. Leonard says that he was a hurdler in college, but could not read. Paul shows this in paragraph 43. Paul could relate to what Mr. Leonard went through and he ends up helping Mr. Leonard learn to read.
Paul receives a URL containing information about Mr. Leonard's past as a track star. This shocked Paul at first and made him wonder why Mr. Leonard kept this from him. He then realized that Mr. Leonard was unable to read, just like himself. This made Paul feel like he isn't such a failure at life after all, because he is now good at track and field as well as has the ability to use a learning center to learn how to read.
It gives you backround information so you can get to understand the characters more to really feel the strory. Without some back round information it can make a story hard to follow.
Paul found out that Mr. Leonard was a very good hurdler. Mr. Leonard ran 400 meter hurdles at nationals, Mr. Leonard even broke records. When Mr. Leonard told Paul that he flunked out and lost his scholarship. Paul got pushed to try harder at hurdles and reading.
Paul is affected in that learing Mr. Leonards background has made him more determined to work hard on reading and the new sport he is in. This also gave him better understanding of Mr. Leonard's life so he does not feel like his reading problem is such a rareity, and Paul has decided to help him with his reading the same way Mr. Leonard helped him with hurrdles.
An example from the story that tells Paul some background information about Mr. Leonard is when Paul gets on the track and field website thats says Mr. Leonard was a college track star. It surprises Paul and also lets him know Mr. Leonard was a good runner. Also it inspires Paul to continue track and even become an even better athelete.
Paul is surprised about the background information.  He was surprised he won 400 meters at nationals and broke the records.  He wants to know more about him.
The information that Mr. Leonard provides has a great effect on Paul. As he is telling Paul about his past it reminds him of himself because he is the same way and wants to change his ways and bcome an achiever in life. He also wants to make Mr. Leonard happy by doing track and field.
When Mr. Leonard explained to Paul that he had also struggled in life with reading disablities. Then Paul relized that he was suffering the same thing and why he has to go to the learning center to learn how to read. Mr. Leonard didn't have much of a way to learn how to read in school. He had no learning centers but in collage he had tutors that ried to help him. But the collage was to hard so he dropped out. When told that to Paul the young man noticed that it sounded just like him.
I think this affected Paul becuase he thought he was just a gym teacher. Little did Paul know, but Mr. Leonard was a start track runner. This background information that Paul gets helps him understand why Mr. Leonard is helping him. This also makes him want to help with his reading problems. At the end of the story Paul wants to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
The effect it has on paul is he has a better understanding of Mr. Leonard because he finds out he can't read either so he can understand how Mr. Leonard feels.
Paul feels like since Mr. Lenard has helped him become a track and field runner, he should help Mr. Lenard learn how to read. Paul does this by saying that Mr. Lenard has some training to do. Paul realized the effect that flunking out of college had on Mr. Lenard. He was also empathetic for Mr. Lenard. He wanted to help Mr. Lenard like Mr. Lenard helped him.
Paul related better to Mr. Leonard after he found out that Mr. Leonard wasn't very good at reading either.
The backround story you get on Mr. Leonard is that he was a good athlete, but he was not a good student. College scouts told Mr. Leonard that his grades didn't matter and that they would have tutors for him. But since he never did his own work and always had his friends help him during high school, he could not handle the more difficult college work. This caused him to fail his classes and lose his scholarship.      Paul could relate to Mr. Leonard's emotions because he too, had difficulties wtih school work. At the end of the stroy, Paul tells Mr. Leonard its time for him to start his training. This implys that since Mr. Leonard has helped Paul with his running, that Paul will help Mr. Leonard to learn to read.
the effect that the background of Mr. Leonard has on paul is the they are almost alike.
Paul is affected by the background information because he is able to empathize with Mr. Leonard about reading difficulties. He also most likely understands that, had he been born in an earlier age, he may have had the same college experience as Mr. Leonard. Paul is also influenced by the background information to help Mr. Leonard 'train' in reading, which is Paul's way of showing gratitude and appreciation for Mr. Leonard's efforts to train Paul in track and field.
Mr. Leonard's background information had a large effect on Paul. Mr. Leonard won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals but flunked out of college because he could not read, and the school work was too challenging. No school would take a runner who couldn't read. After Paul learned all of this information, he felt empathy for Mr. Leonard. Paul had walked in his shoes somewhat. He knew the feelings of embarrassment when he was called to read aloud or did not know an answer. Paul was very grateful and shocked that Mr. Leonard gave up his time to help Paul succeed, and he wants to repay him now for all his help and dedication.
that anyone can be good at something but sometimes a little trouble can ruin everything just speaking about mr. leonards grades he was a good runner just not a good student paul is oustanded by it so it encourages him to do good in school and on the track to show Mr. Leonard he can do it
The effect it had on Paul was that basically he could be a great athlete but he would have to have his grades right also.He was a college freshmen who won the 40 meter hurdkes at nationals, but he couldnt read.
Learning that Mr. Leonard had trouble reading as well my Paul feel less alone in the fact he has trouble with reading and schol. Before he felt stupid when he was called on to read in class or to answer a question he didn't know the answer to and everyone else did. Now he realizes he isn't alone in his struggles which makes him slighty more confident.
Paul was shocked. He did not know what to think.
When he learns that Mr. Leonard was a track star, Paul is slightly unhappy that he wasn't told. He even asks Mr. Leonard why he didn't tell Paul. He then feels like Mr. Leonard is a kindred spirit when he says 'the emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.' He feels empathy for Mr. Leonard and that makes Paul want to help him at the end of the story.
At first,he admires Mr.Leonard. He saw that he had been a very talented athlete and he wonders why he never told him about it. When Paul finds out Mr. Leonard can't read, he becomes sympathetic and wants to help him just as Mr. Leonard helped Paul with the hurldes.
The effect of Mr. Leonard's background on Paul is great.  Paul can connect himself to Mr. Leonard because their backgrounds are similar.
Finding out about Mr. Leonard's past helps Paul in realizing that he can do things he didn't know he could do. Seeing what happened to Mr. Leonard helped Paul fight through challenges. In the end, Paul says 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard, It's time to start your training.'
The effect the background information has on Paul about Mr. Leonard in the story is that Paul has the same problems Paul had but Paul is getting help with it and Paul never was interested in sports but Mr. Leonard was and he was good at them too. So since Mr. Leonard helped Paul, Paul would help him.
The effect it has on Paul, is that he's going throught the same things as Mr. Leonard went through. For example, when Mr. Leonard was in high school he could read either, and he relied on his friends for the work that was givin. But as he went to college and he flunked out because of his reading disability. Paul refers to this because he can't read either. All in all, Mr. Leonard, wants Paul to succeed unlike he did. Mr. Leonard wants Paul to do his best and do better then he did.
Paul begins to feel bad for Mr. Leonard and sees that they are similar and so many different ways. They both are not the best at reading but they both try to become better at it, just as they try to become better athletes.
Paul finds background information on Mr. Leonard from the website. Paul pulled the printout of Mr. Leonard when he used to run. Mr. Leonard then smiled sadly. The effect makes the reader wonder why Mr. Leonard is sad, and makes Paul wonder why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about this before.
When Paul found out background information about Mr. Leonard he was surprised. Since he found out that Mr. Leonard was a great athlete but not a good student, he felt good for learning to read. Since Mr. Leonard said colleges did not want a runner who could not read he flunked out. Paul apperciated the fact that he knows how to read by knowing this fact about Mr. Leonard.
Paul feels sorry for Mr. Leonard, because he understands and can relate to how he feels. Mr. Leonard's past of 'feelings of embarrassment,' were Paul's present life.
Paul was a guy who felt neglected and was always picked last and Mr. Leonard picked up on it.  He knows what it is like to feel embarrassed to not be able to do something because he flunked out of college.  He motivated Paul to do hurdles and showed him how they are obstacles in life. He also found that he was not good at reading either so he was concerned and wanted to help.
The stouy was about paul whns to be the beast.
The effect after Paul figured out about Mr. Leonard's past was really good for him because Mr. Leonard had the same probolems with reading and his grades but back then it didnt matter what your grades were. It was showing Paul that if he put his mind to it and tried hard he could acomplish anything he set his mind to.
Paul is amazed at the achievments of Mr. Leonard and is curious as to why he did not pursue his talent. In line 40, Paul asks 'Well, what happened after that.' This shows that, at the time, Paul didnt understand why Mr. Leonard didn't pursue track and field. Afterwards, Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard is illiterate. He becomes empathetic because he sees they share the same struggle.
The effect that the background information on Mr. Leonard had on Paul was he wanted to help. He was confused on what happened since Mr. Leonard was a good athlete who broke records doing 400 meter hurdles in college as a freshman. Mr. Leondard told him that he was a good athlete, but not a good student. He could not read. And Paul wanted to help. He wanted to return the favor and train him and to help him read, because Mr. Leonard first trained him on the hurdles and it motivated him to know he can do anything and that it just takes training.
It didn't occured to the narrator at first when Mr. Leonard asked him for his name, but later the narrator realized that it was an odd question because Mr. Leonard checked the narrator's hall pass, which had his name on it, twice every week. Later the narrator found some information about Mr. Leonard as a track player in college. The narrator was curious about what had happened to Mr. Leonard after his broken record as a college freshman. Mr. Leonard sheeplishly told the narrator that he flunked out the college because he couldn't read very well. Then the narrator realized that Mr. Leonard asked for his name because he couldn't read the narrator's hall pass.
The information that Paul gets is really familiar to him. He is used to the embarrassment of not being able to read just like Mr. Leonard is. In paragraph 45 Paul starts to change his mind about Mr. Leonard.
It makes Paul want to know what happened and why he hadn't told him. I think Paul might have been upset because he had trust in him.
when paul finds out that MR, Leonard was once a track star he was shocked to find out why he stoped doin track . it was becuase he was a bad student and dosent want paul to be one so hes helping him out.

Aftering hearing about Mr. Leonard's experience of being a freshman who had won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals, and who had broke records, and asking what had happened effected Paul the most. Also after hearing that Mr. Leonard had fluncked out of college after his freshman year because he had to rely on his friends to get him through school, it encouraged Paul to study his hardest and in his tutoring class, so that he could be a track allstar some day in college, but to be able to handle the rigorous school work that comes with college.
The effect that the reader , Paul gets when he finds out background information about Mr. Leonard, is that he is suprised that Mr. Leonard never mentioned anything about. The authors shows that he is suprised because the passage say that paul askes him why didn't he ever tell him anything about it.
I DISTINGUISHED MYSELF FROM THE MASSES BY BEING ONE OF A SELECT FEW IN THE REMEDIAL READING PRGRAM.
After paul finds out what Mr.Leonard went through about flunking out of college, having everyone having to help him in school and barley passing by, getting a tutor and no other school wants them to run for them because he cant read, paul realizes that he can relate to him and he feels the same way.

The information about Mr. Leonard being a top athlete as a freshman in college and setting records explains to Paul why he is such a good coach to him on the track. But later found information about Mr. Leonard losing his scholarship and flunking out of college explains why Mr. Leonard is so suspicious about why Paul goes to the learning center.
The background information inspires paul to do better because when Mr. Leonard tell paul about his situation paul symisizes when him because he is in the same position.
The background information showed Paul why Mr. Leonard was helping him train for track.  Also Mr. Leonard's past related to what Paul is going through.
When paul finds out that Mr. Leonard went to college on a track schollarship but then failed out because he too could not read, connects Paul to his coach more. Paul realizes that he is not the only one who struggles with something and that he can accomplish great things. In paragraph 45 Paul explains how he knows and understands how his coach felt, he now knows what he can do to help his coach as well.
Paul seems up for a challenge and is ready to start something with leonard. He seems thrilled and excited to join this track team with leaonard and be against him.
The effect that the backround information had on Paul was exciting. He finds it very surprising that Mr. Leonard was such a remarkable athlete. He says ' You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdels at the nationals. You broke records.'
The effect was that he felt a great deal of respect and awe toward Mr. Leonard. Probably because he was surprised to know that the janitor was such a good hurtler. It made him feel kind of good to know that Mr. Leonard was a hurtler, adn that Mr. Leonard was spending time teaching him how to do this. But then, upon learning that Mr. Leonard couldn't read, it probably made Paul feel kind of awed toward Mr. Leonard because he was like him in those ways.
Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard is like him, becasue he can't read and is really good at track. Mr. Leonard does not want Paul to not be able to read and be good at track. He want Paul to be able to read and be good at track.
The background information about Mr. Leonard is suprising to Paul. Paul wonders why Mr. Leonard didn't continue in track and field after that race. He finds that Mr. Leonard is a lot like him and he wants to help him learn how to read just like he helped Paul how to run hurdles.

paul feels imapthectic twords mr.lenord her fells that they are one in the same because of him sharing.
It shows Paul that Mr. Leonard was the same as Paul. He didin't know how to read and he was only good at track. When Paul learns he can't read he extends the favor back and decides he is going to teach Mr. Leonard how to read just like he taught him how to jump hurdles.
Once Paul receives the information about Mr. Leonard, he is encouraged, almost dumbfounded. Paul is shocked because he can't believe the subtleness of the hall monitor that he meets was a former record breaker. Paul is proud of Mr. Leonard, but also confused as to why Mr. Leonard did not go onto bigger and better things. Paul states, 'You were a college freshman who  won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. You broke records.'(paragraph 38).  He continues to ask, 'Well, what happened after that?'(paragraph 40). This show Paul's intent on finding out why Mr. Leonard did not move onto bigger and better things.
The background information that Paul learned about Mr. Leonard I think has made Paul not be ashamed that he is getting help. Mr. Leonard told Paul 'I relied on friends to help me get by, but even then the work was always too hard.' This shows Paul that he should get help with things now, so that in the future he won't rely on other people, like friends, to get him by in college, and learn how to take on responsiblities before he gets into college and flunks out.
It shows that even though he is good at a sport he still has to work hard to keep his grades up. That he should always try his best and to try different things.
Paul is shocked to hear that Mr Leonard was in track an never told anyone
The background information helped paul see why its important to try in school. It also got him motivated to want to go in track.
It shows Paul that school is important. There are other people that can not read either like Mr. Leonard.
Paul was surprised. Paul didnt know Mr. Leonard was a freshman in college who ran the 400 meter hirdles and broke records.
Mr. Leonard is very much like Paul. He was once a young boy, and possesses some of the same problems that Paul seems to have.      As a young child, Mr. Leonard had distractions and difficulties learning. To this day, as he is telling the story to Paul, he is still unable to read. It is obvious that Mr. Leonard wants to help Paul, and show him that he can pass school, if only he works hard to overcome his obstacles. 'I lost my scholarship and flunked out,' Mr. Leonard stated. Paul could see how embarassed the man was to share that, but it only made Paul want to try harder to acheive his grades, and go to college.
When Paul is in school and he has gym class, he is usually always the one thats picked last when it comes to games and sports. He wants to learn how to do a sport good so he doesn't have to be picked last in everything.
During the story the reader understands that Paul has a hard time reading. When he meets Mr. Leonard, Paul becomes motivated by him. By going out for track, Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was once a renowned tack star but failed to stay in school because of his grades. Paul becomes inspired to succeed in school and track for Mr. Leonard. The last paragraph, Paul remembers what Mr. Leonard did for him and wants to help Mr. Leonard with his reading.
The effect that the background information has on Paul is that it encourages him to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
the effect of the background of Mr Loenard has the effect that he was just like him when he felt embarrased about reading and could not and mr leonard could not read which made him emarased to tell of why he cant which was because of his background.
The backround information given to Paul was used to help Mr. Leonard with his reading.
He was surprised when he found out that Mr. Leonard was a high school track star.
Paul probably feels motivated because he isn't the only one who doesn't know how to read. This motivates him to hurdle.
Paul is suprised that Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about how he ran track in high school.
Paul had the same problem as Mr. Leonard they both couldnt read. But the difference Paul had a reading program to go and Mr. Leonard didnt. So Paul sees the similaritys between Mr. Leonard and him with reading.
When Paul learns that Mr. Leonard run track in college and boke some records he realizes how he know so much about track and understands why he is helping him once he is told about how he flunked out of college.Paul relize that he can help Mr. Leonard to so he returns the favor and helps him with what he struggled with in school.
The background information about Mr. Leonard effects Paul because it was surprising that a janitor was a star athlete in college. Paul is overwhelmed because Mr. Leonard broke records and won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals.
Paul understood where Mr. Leonard was coming from.  He  also realized they were similar.  Mr. Leonard helped Paul train for hurtles and Paul decided he could give something in return by teaching Mr. Leonard to read.
During the story Paul is given a website to look at. While looking at the website, her found out a little history on Mr. Leonard's succes in track and field.      In the hall Paul was stopped by him, he was confused when he found out that he did not know Pauls name.
Mr. Leonard has background infromation he doesn't want to tell Paul because his college sport he played he was disappointed on.
I think that Paul noticed how great of person he was. He already had respect for Mr. Leonard and did as he was told, but once he found out he was a track star in college it helped him realize his possibilities. It made Paul more confident to find out that a successful man like him could not read as well.
When Paul gets background information about Mr. Leonard he is extremely surprised. Paul doesn't understand why Mr. Leonard hasn't already informed him of his past accomplishments. After all that Mr. Leonard recounted to him, Paul could completely relate to Mr. Leonard. Paul felt like they had a win win friendship because Mr. Leonard had something to offer him and he had something to offer Mr. Leonard.
The effect it had on Paul was somewhat like the effect Paul had on Mr. Leonard; sympathy. They knew how each other felt not knowing how to read. 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all to familiar to me. I knew them well-feeling of embarassment when I ws called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew.' 'This man had given his time to help me excel at something. Suddenly I realized what I could do for him.' Paul helped Mr. Leonard, just like he had helped Paul.
The information effects Paul because, he finds out that Mr. Leonard is just like him, he cant read. When the coach gave Paul that URL and website to search him. And he read about Mr. Leonard paul wanted to help him be able to read. Just like Mr. Leonard is helping him.
Paul finally understands why Mr. Leonard is interested in him. Paul and Mr. Leonard are alike in a way. They both have problems reading and are good at track. Even though Mr. Leonard is a college flunk out, Paul still feels the same about him if not better.
The effect it has on Paul, is that he finds out, that even his          own english teacher had trouble back when he was in high           school. And he did not want paul to go through the same             things that he had to go through.
he wants paul to not be like he was in school and study harder and make it out there and not flunk out and to teach it only takes effort. there was no one for him back then now there is pople willing to help him if he asks and trys his best.
Mr. Leonard has kind of the same problems as Paul. Mr. Lenoard was a good athlete, but did poorly in school. He relied on friends to help him get by. Mr. Leonard had problems with reading and fluked out of College because of it.
'C'mon,Mr.Leonard,' I said, walking back toward school. 'It's time to start your training.' This statement, made by Paul shows that the background information that was given touched Paul emotionally. After hearing Mr. Leonard's story, Paul made a mental connection with him. They both couldn't read. They had something in common. This new connection lead to Paul being willing to help Mr. Leonard and allowing them to have a closer friendship and to be more empathetic toward one another.
he underwstands why mr. leonard worked with him to do this. mr. leonard was agood athlete b ut didnt know how to read, bc they didnt have help centers.
Paul, was a good athlete, but not a good student. He had no learning centes in school. o relied on friends to help get him by, even thou he worked hard, and went to college.
It effects the story in ways that Mr. Leonard was a phenomenom. He broke many records and the narator was being trained by a star athlete.
Paul feels horrible about what happened to Mr.Leonard. Paul then feels remorse over the fact Mr.Leonard can't read,and then he relates their problems.
That paul didn't really know about sports that well. So he didn't know about Mr. Leonard at all which made Mr. Leonard not tell hima bout his past when he was in college.
It encourages him to do his best, therefor he goes to the track meets and is going to compete.
The information Paul learns on Mr. Leonard makes him wonder, and probably think of him as a role model. Paul had no idea he was an awesome hurtle runner and to find out he got kicked out of college for grades probably makes Paul feel like he can help him just like Mr. Leonard helped him with hurtles.
Paul reminded Mr. Leonard about his college days. Paul is one of Leonards best hurdlers.
After the realization of Mr. Leonard's past, Paul wanted to help him. Paul saw that Mr. Leonard was sad, and a little regretful, about flunking out of college so he wanted to teach him. Mr. Leonard had assisted Paul, and now Paul wanted to assist Mr. Leonard by tutorong him in Reading/Comprehension.
Paul and Mr. Loenard both have the same thing in commom, they both do not know how to read.  Both are afraid to read aloud and talk infront of the class. But after a while of talking to Mr. Leonard, Paul finds out that he was an amazing track athelete. Mr. Leonard teaches Paul the lesson of 'nothing is impossible without determination.
The background information that Paul learns about Mr. Leonard makes Mr. Leonard feel sad and kind of embarrassed. For example 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well-feelings of embarassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew'
In the beginning of the story, Paul tells the reader that he cannot read. When Mr. Leonard tells Paul to stay after one day and showed him the basketball team, Paul tells the reader that he is always the last guy choosen in gym class and doesn't want more of that treatment. Then when Mr. Leonard tells Paul to run, Paul doesn't disobey because he is just use to doing as he is told. Throughtout the story, with Mr. Leonard's help, Paul becomes great at track. Upon finding out that Mr. Leonard cannot read, Paul decides that is it time to gave back to the man who made him a fast runner.
The effect it has on Paul is that Mr. Leonard is just like him except he never learned how to read. Paul now knows he has a chance to make something of himself because he gets extra help, unlike Mr. Leonard.
From the way that Paul responded from the information about Mr. Leonard, he seemed suprised and kind of anrgy that Mr. Leonard didnt tell him. Once he explained his reasons for why he didnt tell Paul, i think Paul understood more. I think now Paul has more of a connection with Mr. Leonard because they have something in common. Neither of them can read and they are both good at hurdles. Towards the end of the story it makes them closer.
The effect Paul gets from reading about Mr. Leonard's background changes what he thought about him and answered a lot of questions for him. After paul knew why he flunked out of college, he took Mr. Leonard too the learning center.
The effect it has on Paul is that, Paul can relate to it. He knows what it feels like to be embarrassed about not being able to read.
Mr. Leonard was in the same situation that Paul was in. He is unable to read but is a good at running track. It effects paul by making him want to help Mr. Leonard to read which is at the end of the story.
When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonards past as a track star who flunked out of college because he couldn't read, he saw it as an oppurtunity to help him. Mr. Leonard had helped Paul become good at track and in return Paul said he would help him learn to read.
It gives Paul more knowledge on Mr. Leonard. It also makes him more confident in letting Mr. Leonard coach him.
The background information about Mr. Leonard motivates Paul to help him with something. When he questions him, and finds out the truth, he says, 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard. It's time to start your training.'
All the background information on Paul is the same as Mr. Leonard. Paul said in the second paragragh thourgh the seventh he was had a convorstion with Mr. Leonard. Mr. Leonard asked Paul, 'where do you think you're going.' Paul said, 'Learning center.' Mr. Leonard asked, 'Why.' Paul said, 'Why?' 'I can't read.' Later on in the story Paul pulled out a piece of paper and said, 'Why didn't you tell me about this?' Mr. Leonard said, 'I looked good back then, didn't I?' Paul said, 'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. You broke records.' Mr. Leonard said, 'I remember, best race of my life.' Paul said, 'Well, what happened after that?' Mr. Leonard said, 'I was a good athlete, but not a good student. We had no learning center in our school. I relied on friends to help me get by, but even then the work was always to hard.' Paul said, 'But you went to college.' Mr. Leonard said, 'Things were different back then, the college scouts told me that my grades didn't matter, that I'd have tutors to help me, but college work is a whole lot harder than high school work i lost my scholarship and flunked ou. No other school wanted a runner who couldn't read. See both Paul and Mr. Leonard can't read. They are almost alike.
The information about Mr. Leonard came shocking to paul and he noticed his teacher as someone like only a janitor, he had no hope in his future and so when he found out about his school janitor he then had the courage to succeed in what he thought was impossible, just like Mr. Leonard.
Paul is a little touched by the information he finds out about Mr.  Leonard. Paul knows with a lot of effort and continued practice he can be a decent track and feild athlete. Paul has a reading disablility and works hard in the school's learning center and disovers that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college because of his reading abilities. This motivated Paul to help Mr. Leonard and to make sure he becomes a better reader.
After Paul listend to Mr. Leonard's story about his college experience, it opens his eyes and makes him realize what he must do. Paul wants to pay Mr. Leonard back, not with money but with knowledge. At the end of the story Paul tells Mr. Leonard that 'It's time to start your trainging', meaning its time to learn to read.
It makes paul feel sorry for him and then teach him how to read.
The effect that the background information has on Paul is that
Because then he knows why he didnt say just come on it wont hurt you. Another reason is thats why he knows he couldnt read his name on the hall pass. Also instead of looking at the hall pass he just asked him where he was going. The coach just probably looked at it and pretended to read it. Then at the very end he knows he feels sorry for Paul. Also Paul feels sorry for him and tells the coach come on lets go start your training.
The effect the information had on Paul about Mr. Leonard was that Paul was not the most intelligent kid and neither was Mr. Leonard back in his day. Paul realized even though you do poor in something doesn't mean you can't still susceed. Mr. Leonard wanted to have Paul realize that he's not the only one in the situation he's in.
The background check on Paul would be about the same as Mr. Leonard, becasue he was very good at track and field but, he couldn't read. He wanted to help Paul get better at track and field and much better at reading. he wants him to sucess in collage and be great at track and field.
The effect the background information on Mr. Leonard  had on Paul was sad because he was in the exact situation that he was in. Mr. Leonard couldn't read. but he was a really good athlete. He had lost his scholarship though, because he couldn't read.     Paul wanted to help Mr. Leonard like he helped Paul because he felt grateful toward him. So Paul started helping Mr. Leonard learn to read.
Paul is kind of affended that Mr. Leonard never told him because he says, 'Why didn't you tell me about this?' After he found out the whole truth behind the story he had sympathy for Mr. Leonard because Paul is in the same struggle and can relate. He feels for Leonard because he lost his future all because he couldn't do something as simple as read but it also made him realize that he is in a struggle against reading and school too and if he doesn't over come his obstacle his future at hurdles could end like Mr. Leonards... or simply never start.
When Paul gets the URL from the coach to check out Mr. Leonards background, he could not believe it. This guy was just like Paul. He won many awards for track, but the one disadvantage that he had was he had flunked out of college because he did not know how to read. After Paul figured out that Mr. Leonard could not read because he had to ask him his name, he knew he was going through the same thing. Paul thought that since Mr. Leonard helped him achieve what he wanted with the track, that Paul would help him out by getting back into college. Atleast, try to help him find a center that would enable him to become better at what he could not do. Paul was just helping Mr. Leonard like he helped Paul.
When Paul discovers that Mr. Leonard can't read, he understands Mr. Leonard's feelings about flunking out of college. Paul also knows why he was asked what his name was even tho Mr. Leonard sees his pass every day. It also explains why Mr. Leonard did get suspicious about Paul leaving class early. Since Mr. Leonard helped Paul so much, he wanted to return the favor and invited Mr. Leonard to his study group.
Paul learns that Mr. Leonard never learned hwo to read, and Paul struggles with that himself and has to have special help while at school. He connects with Mr. Leonard, as mentioned in paragraph 45, 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all to familiar to me. I knew them well--feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud...' and understands who Mr. Leonard feels.     After learned about Mr. Leonard's history, Paul looks back on the days that Mr. Leonard helped him with hurdles, and decides to help Mr. Leonard learn to read.
The effect that the background information has on Paul is that he is suprised at Mr. Leonard's achievements in college and how he is just a hall moniter in school after achieving greatness.
He want's to do better at reading things, and Mr.Leonard is trying to get him help him set his goals in life like he did. When he found that out he wanted to try to set goals like he did.
At frist Paul is pround for Mr. leonard because he broke records in collage. But then when he finds out Mr. Leonard flunked out of collage because he had a hard time reading. Paul felt sympathic. And realized since Mr.Leonard helped him that he could help read better.
It makes Paul feel better about himself. He feels that way because he realizes that maybe he could actually excel at something. That he could actually be good at something and not feel like he is left out. Paul had no idea that Mr. Leonard was in a way like him. I think Paul gained some confidence discovering Mr. Leonard's past.
Asked him questions every day he stop him in the hall to see his hall pass.
Paul never knew that Mr. Leonard was in track. He learned that he was good at hurdles and broke records. Mr. Leonard then told Paul that he flunked out of college because he couldn't read also. Paul then felt closer to Mr. Leonard and a little bad for him because they didn't have help at his school. So Paul decided to help him read.
After reading and finding out all he did about Mr. Leonard, Paul felt that he was no longer alone in feeling left out. He had finally found someone who in all reality, was just like him. As Paul talks to Mr. Leonard about what he read and seeing his reaction to the things that were discussed, Paul decided the best thing to do was to help Mr. Leonard out by helping him learn to read.
Paul shows an interest to him and try to help. Paul understand the situation of Mr. Leonard. Therefore paul interested in help him our
Mr. Leonard was once in the same situation as Paul was in. It makes Paul think how far he has gotten and how much help he recieved.
The back ground information on Mr. Leonard reflects on Paul because,Mr. Leonard was in the same situation as Paul. Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard is empathetic and it motivates him to do good.  Paul feels the same ways at Mr. Leonard an wants to retrn the favore.
When Paul learns about Mr. Leonard's past, he doesn't get discouraged. Instead it motivates him to help Mr. Leonard. Paul wants to help Mr. Leonard like Mr. Leonard helped him. In paragragp forty-five, Paul states that he understands the emotions that Mr. Leonard felt, and that is why he decides to start training him in reading at the end of the story.
Paul is a student that needed help at reading .But also he needed a tutor for help to become very good reader and talented at what ever he do.
Paul is surprised that Mr. Leonard never told him about when he had ran the hurdles in High School. Paul asks Mr. Leonard about why he never told him. Once he finds out why, he feels a stronger connection between the two. He feels as if he has found a way to give back to Mr. Leonard also. We know this because at the end of the story, the narrorator says, 'C'mon Mr. Leonard, it's time to start your training.'
Paul discovers the truth about Mr. Leonard and he was familiar with the same feeling and situation. When Mr. Leonard first tells Paul about what he used to be, Paul was filled with unbelief. Until he explained his situation of not being able to read and dropping out of school, Paul knew those feelings, and it motivates him to try harder to be the best he can while training so that he may make Mr. Leonhard proud.
He told him to meet him at 2:30pm. Then with all the trainning. He eneded up telling him that he was in high school and ran track. And ended up going to collage and droped out cause, the school didnt want some kid that couldnt read.
Mr. Leonard's past had a big effect on Paul. It incoureges paul to do well in reading and even stars have the same problem he does. It helps him not to hold back because. if Mr. Leonard can do it he can to. Just with a differant outcome.
I believe that the background information Paul learns shows him that even if you aren't as good in school as others, you can still be the best you can be. Also I think he learned that friendship was the key way to success, and since Mr. Leonard helped him with his hurdles, that he must help him read. So they can both overcome life's challenges.
The information on Mr. Leonard's past had astonished Paul; however, it also helped motivate him to do better. He realized the importance of doing something well and the feeling you get when you do it well. He also felt a similarity with Mr. Leonard which helped him make the bond stronger.
Paul is a lot like Mr. Leonard , they both couldn't read but they were really good at hurdles. Mr. Leonard got helped with grades but it didn't work it was still to hard for him. The only thing he was good at was track. Mr. Leonard beat all kinds of records and the 400 meter hurdles but struggle in school.      Paul is the same way when Mr. Leonard found out he Paul couldn't read he remembered how it was like being called out in class to read. Mr. Leonard deciced to help with hurdles and become good at them so he can fill like he can accomplish anything in his life.
It reminded Paul of himself. Paul said 'I knew them well, feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when....' Paul knew the reason why Mr.Leonard tried to help him and encourage him to do well.
The background information makes paul wonder why Mr. Leonard didnt tell him about how he was a big athlete in college. He feels that he can relate to Mr. leonard. Because he cant read all that well, but he is good at track.
he finds out that mr. lenoard was a track star and that he held a bunch of records. theses are good thigs for paul because he has a coach that knows what he is doing.
As Paul learns about Mr. Leonards past, he begins to grow a stronger bond with him, sseing as he felt his pain.
The background information about Mr. Leonard has a staggering effect on Paul.  Paul is astounded that his coach was such an impressive athlete in his prime.  His first actions are to inquire about his coach's former accomplishments.
I think that Paul really relates to Mr. Leonards background information, because he couldn't read back when he was a kid and neither can Paul. That is why Mr. Leonard took Paul to do hurdles because it will help him feel more accepted and he will know that he is good at something, just like Mr. Leonard.
I think that the information that Paul learns about Mr. Leonard makes him respect him more, because he knows that he was once a good track star so he thinks that he will be a good coach. I also think that Paul felt alot more comfortable with Mr. Leonard when he found out that he couldn't read because he felt like he could relate to Mr. Lenord more.
He feels privledged to have such a great, successful athlete to be training him how to do the hurdles. He wonders why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him why he was so succesful from the beginning when he first started training him.(I pulled out the printout I'd downloaded the night before from my pocket. 'Why didn't you tell me about this?' paragraph 35)
The revelation that Mr. Leonard also struggled with schoolwork provided a way to establish a deeper connection to Paul.  When the narrarator states, 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.  I knew them well...,' he is revealing how he can empathize with Mr. Leonard.
The background infromation the Paul learns about Mr. Leonard effects him by showing him that he's not the only one with reading problems and the Mr. Leonard was just like him as a kid. It also makes him want to learn more and help Mr. Leonard learn how to read too.
Paul feels embrrassment when Mr. Leonard tells him about his schooling.'I knew them well-feeling of embarrassment'He was embarrassed because he did some of the things Mr. Leonard told him he did.
Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard about al the trouble he had back in high school because he is goiung through all of that know.  Paul wants to be as good of a runner as Mr. Leonard.
In the story 'Gifts' Paul has trouble reading.  Twice a week he visits Mr. Leonard the hall monitor.  After awhile Mr. Leonard asks paul to come out to the track with him and paul does.  As paul starts training he gets better and better till he ends up talking to the high school track coach.  With futher inspection and guidance from the coach, paul finds out Mr. Leonard was a national champion for the 400 hurdles.  Come to find out the story is the same both have trouble reading.  Mr. Leonard was not able to get help and lost his scholarship.  He wants paul to acheive a better life.
it changes his mind about sports.

the effect that his background information has on Paul is he feels like he can relate to not reading and he likes track.
The background information Paul finds on Mr. Leonard has a huge effect on Paul because he has a lot in common with Mr. Leonard. Mr. Leonard was great at hurdles, and so is Paul. Mr. Leonard also does not know how to read, and that is what Paul has troubles with and is trying to fix. The information on Mr. Leonard makes Paul want to strive more for what he could have.
The effect that background information has on Paul is that Paul can't read and when mr. Leonard was younger he flunked out of college and didn't want Paul to flunk, so he pushed him.
The background infromation on Mr. Leonard effects Paul because it helps Paul realize that he and Leonard have the same problem. They both dont want to be embarrassed by the mistakes they make. Paul with problem at reading and Leonard with his drop out history, but this also helps Paul by giving him the courage to get past his problem. Thats how the background information effects Paul.
Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was an amazing athlete when he was younger.  He is a bit disappointed that Mr. Leonard never told him about his college track success.  In the last paragraph it shows that Paul and Mr. Leonard end up switching roles because of the information.
When Paul knows about Mr. Leonard's
I think that it helps him alot because he now knows that the coach was ding what he knew trying to help the kid on something that he could not accomplish himself.
In the story, the reader is told of Mr. Leonard's achievements in track and his failures as a student. It is said that although he was able to win and set records nationally, he wasnt able to pursue this track career because he couldn't maintain his grades. Through learning this, Paul is able to empathize. He can relate to Mr. Leonard's struggles and take that to know that he was not just the child with a learning disability, but also the child with potential in his seemingly-dissapointing life.
Paul has sympathy for Mr. Leonard because Paul knows how he is feeling. Paul will get called on in class to read or give an answer. He gets embarrassed when he does not know the answer and everyone else in the class does. Paul then relizes that Mr. Leonard helped him with hurdles, and Paul can help Mr. Leonard with reading.
He gets information about him when he dont need it so he takes offense to it.
This effect Paul by making him inspired that the coach would take time out for him and lend him some advice.
That Mr. Leonard was a great athlete and he knew that he could achieve and also be a great athlete if he kept practicing and kept training.
It makes Paul finally realize why Mr. Leonard is helping him.  They relate in a way that Paul could never imagine, and Mr. Leonard is only trying to help.
Paul feels that he understand's Mr. Leonard better because he knows what it is like to not be able to read.  This makes him want to work harder and then teach Mr. Leonard to read.
When Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a track star he wonders why he isn't anymore. When Mr. Leonard tells him that he flunked out of his scholarship, Paul is very empathetic to him because he knows how Mr. Leonard feels. When Paul finds out about all of this, he wants to help Mr. Leonard.
... I don't know
The effect it has on Paul is it shows him that if he works hard anything is possible.
By learning about Mr. Leonards's past, Paul feels motivated to overcome the dificulties that are ahead of him. Paul feels that he should work harder on everything in his life after discovering Mr. Leonard's career in college track.
Paul finds out that that Mr. Leonard was a track star when he was in high school and got a scholar sship for college but he couldnt read so they had to take him out.
When Paul learns of Mr. Leonard's past, he becomes sympathetic towards Mr. Leonard's reading difficulties, which Paul also has. This sympathy is expressed when Paul tells Mr. Leonard that: 'It's time to start [his] training.' This meaning that Paul is trying to help Mr. Leonard overcome his problems.
The background information that the reader recieves about Mr. Leonard is that he used to be a track star in college and that he could not read.  Also that when he was in school he was not a good student and relied on friends to help him.  Knowing this information, it had a great effect on Paul.  Now that Paul knew this he was more determined to excel in school and do well, and also find something he likes and excel in that, like the hurdles and track.
The information he found effected him in a good way. It made him feel better about the fact that he couldn't read. He found out that he wasn't the only one out there that couldn't read and it gave him more reasons to keep going to the learning center to get better at reading. It was the extra push to keep him going.
After learning about Mr. Leonard's past, Paul seems to be able to identify more with him. He seems to feel closer to Mr. Leonard and wants to help him too. He also realizes why Mr. Leonard did what he did to help Paul.
paul like the information because it information that he would not have had on his trainer if he had not asked
In 'Gifts' Paul learns background information about Mr. Leonard.  Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was an award winning track star at his college, but flunked out and lost his scholarship when he had a difficult time reading.  Paul responds by feeling more of a connection to Mr. Leonard.  Paul then feels motivated to 'train' Mr. Leonard in reading.
Back when he was in collage he was a track star. He wasnt very good in school and counted on his friends to help him with his school work. Even then the school work was to hard for him. He lost his scholarship and flunked out of school.
Mr. Lenonard was a great athlete in track and field. In school he had trouble in reading but he got help from a learning place. Then he went to college and aslo got help.
The background information makes Paul puzzled.  Paul did not understand why Mr. Leonard kept his college tack experience a secret.  When Mr. Leonard told Paul that he flunked out of college, Paul understood why he kept it a secret.
The background information that the reader gets during the stroy effects Paul by giving him motivation.  Since Mr. Leonard was a successful track star back when he was in school he felt confidence that he could teach Paul how to be a successful runner as well.  Throughout the story this confidence in Paul helps motivate him to train and listen to Mr. Leonard.
After Mr. Lenonard told his story to Paul, Paul realized that acdemic learning is more important than sports. He has to participate in his school work. Because no matter how good Mr. Lenorad was, his college still lost his scholarship and flunkes out. It is important to learn in schools.
The effect of Mr. Leonard background information doesn't bother Paul that much. When Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard used to be a track and field star, he makes connections. In paragraph 35, Paul is alittle upset that Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about his amazing college career. But in paragraph 45, when Paul realizes that him and Mr. Leonard are very much alike, he is happy and wants to give back to Mr. Leonard.
When Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was illeterate, he understands that he should help him read, just as Mr. Leonard was helping him in track. This is implied in paragraph 46, when the narrator tells Mr. Leonard it is time for his 'training,' which means the narrator will help Mr. Leonard to learn how to read.
The background information of Mr. Leonard inspires Paul. The information inspires Paul becuase he feels like there is a connection between himself and Mr. Leonard. Mr. Leonard, although not able to read, was successful at other things including track. By Paul learning of Mr. Leonard's past, he feels more accepted and normal.
The background information on Mr. Leonard had an effect on Paul because, he seemed anxious to know why Mr. Leonard didn't hurdle anymore and what had happened.
Mr. Leonard and Paul are two characters that are quite similar. In the story, it says that both characters had a very hard time reading and they are both athletic. So Mr. Leonard's effect on Paul is motivational. He wants Paul to not repeat Mr. Leonard's past and instead push on and be the best he can be.
The effect that background information of Mr. Leonard has on paul is that he is not alone and the emotions were all too familiar to him. He knew them well. The feelings of embarassment when he was called to read aloud in class. He knows that even if he can't read like everyone else he can still be good at something. Mr. Leonard gave his time to help Paul excel. So Paul decided to see Mr. Leonard excel at something to.
Once Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard past, he is in shock.      Not knowing that the hall monitor, Mr. Leonard, was a star in college; who won the four hundred meter hurdles and broke records.
Paul is suspicious on why Mr.Leonard didn't tell him about his past. He questions him on why he didn't tell him about his track records in college. Then Mr. Leonard tells him he flunked out because he couldn't read. Paul gets influeced by this to teach Mr. Leonard to read, because Mr. Leonard influenced him to run hurdles.
Background has an effect on Paul including encouragement and confidence.  Paul tells of how he met Mr. Leonard and how he became close to him.  Later, Paul tells about on the track and because Paul already knows Mr. Leonard, he has confidence in his abilities already.  After the first time around the track, Paul feels discouraged but Mr. Leonard, already being his friend helps to encourage Paul.
The information probaby has a big effect on Paul because Paul can't read either. Paul may feel he can look up to Mr. Leonard and that he is his romodel.
Paul is empathetic to Mr. Leonard's troubles. Like Paul, Mr. Leonard was poor in school. Paul feels closer to him, saying that he knew Mr. Leonard's feelings and words 'were all too familiar'. He realizes then that Mr. Leonard helped him excel in something and offers to help Mr. Leonard excel in something, too.
He felt like they had something incommon. 'I knew them well-feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didnt know an answer everyone else knew.'
The effect that the background check of Mr. Leonard has on Paul is a good one. It opens Paul's eyes and shows him that you have to be a good student first then you can be an athlete second. If you dont do it in the classroom then there is no point in even going out to try and do a sport. Mr. Leonard wants to live his dreams through of Paul because he wants Paul to do something that he was not capeable of doing. This was a huge lesson in Paul's life and it took him one step closer to succeeding his dreams and goals.
it gave him more confidence knowing that Mr. Leonard actually knows what he is doing but he is also consernd why he didnt tell him about it in the first day.
Paul doesn't seemed surprised that Mr. Leonard was a star athlete in track. He's more interested in why Mr. Lenoard never told him about it before. Paul asks Mr. Leonard why he had never said anything before, and Leonard smiles sadly while he remembers the past. It turns out Mr. Leonard wasn't a good reader either, and flunked out of college. Paul has the same feelings and relates to Mr. Lenoard.  Paul then supports him by telling Mr. Leonard, 'It's time to start your training.'
the reader gets background on Mr. Leonard from a track website that the Coach gave him to look up. Paul didn understand why he quiet. but he also didn know that Leonard didn no how to read. Leonard had friends in high school that would help him get thru all his classes. but college was alot harder and Leonard could not keep up with the school work , so he flunked out. So paul decided to help Leonard to learn how to read, like Loenard helped paul to overcome an obstical.
He fells bad that his teacher for track lost his scholar ship for not being able to read. Thats what paul is dong right now is learning how to read and run the hurdles and paul can help his teacher learn how to read.
When Paul first discovers Mr. Leonard's seemingly glorious past, he is puzzled at the notion that Mr. Leonard would keep that information from him. Paul then must decide to confront Mr. Leonard. Upon doing so, he makes a greater realization that draws him closer to not only Mr. Leonard, but himself too. Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard also struggled with literature and reading. In fact, Mr. Leonard's inferiority regarding the subject helps Paul to identify with him, for he too is plagued with the same problem.     Because Paul discovers this, he feels a drive. He feels a reason. He actually begins to feel adequate. Now, with the understanding that he can achieve, he feels reason to pay back the favor. He decides to help Mr. Leonard learn to read well. Without knowing that Mr. Leonard had once been such a star athelete who failed in academics, Paul would have never had made such a life changing change -- realizing his value.
He wants to help the kid because he is a good boy. and
Paul is mad that someone check's his hall pass twice a week. And he really don't like that becuase they think he is going some where else then where he says he is going so that is way they check his hall pass twice a week.
I personally think Mr. Leonard giving Paul his story about what he use to be and how it came crashing down really motivated Paul and made him want to help Mr. Leonard. The fact that Mr. Leonard's dream was shattered because couldn't read made Paul want to work hard so that he wouldn't have to fall in the same pattern as Mr. Leonard did when he was younger. He probably felt as if he needed to do something to make up for what happened in his younger years so Paul took him to the learning center so that he could get some much needed help in reading. Paul felt that Mr. Leonard's words were 'all too familiar' because Paul was having trouble reading as well.
I guess paul is a friend that didnt git in so yhen it was his bussness to
Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard is trying to help him become great at hurdles. Mr. Leonard knows that Paul had trouble reading but he worked to fix the problem by being in the remedial reading program. Mr. Leonard was fantastic at hurdles in college but he couldn't read so no colleges wanted him to go there. he wanted Paul to be able to be mentally and physically well.
It made people think of him different.
Paul was shocked, but was feeling not alone. Paul said that Mr. Leonard had givin his time to help him with track and to help him excel at  somthing. It made Paul realise what he could do for Mr. Leonard.
They become good friends and because of Mr. Leonard he gets very good at hurdles. He finds out that Mr. Leonard can't read and because of the learning center Paul helps Mr. Leonard how to read.
What?
Paul realizes that he needs to learn to read if he is going to be successful in hurdling because Mr. Leonard had to quit what he was loved doing because he couldnt read, and thats what makes him realize.
By finding information about Mr. Leonard on the internet, It gave Paul the motivation to help Mr. leonard just like Mr. leonard had helped Paul.
When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard, he wonders why he didn't tell him. He approaches Mr. Leonard about it, and finds out that he flunked out of college because he couldn't read. Paul decides he wants to help Mr. Leonard, just as Mr. Leonard helped him.
he sees that he is trying to get him to do something with his life he doesnt want to see him end up in the situation he was in. he knows the kid is trying to read and that he should do something else to motivate him. Leonardo is trying to be a roll modle and make a difference in teh kids life.
Paul find out that Mr. Leonard was a good track runner, but not so good at reading. It effected Paul by giving him a reason to run and work harder.
It has a big effect on Paul because Mr. Leonard had the same problems he had when he was younger. In the story he shows Mr. Leonard what he found out about him and Mr. Leonard felt sad because he didn't want Paul to find out he couldn't read either.
In this story when Paul gets the background information on Mr. Leonard it opens up a bunch of different windows to him. Paul starts thinking about why he didn't run anymore. paul confronted Mr. Leonard about it and discovered Mr. Leonard was in the same shoes as Paul was. Paul then realizes why Mr. Leonard was trying to help him.
he had an effect on paul because he tryed so hard to be a good student.
It helps him feel better knowing that he wasn't the only one with the same kind of reading problem.
In highschool Lenard was like Paul not good at school work but a good athletic guy.
He is overwhelmed with who he is talking to and that Mr. Leonard has the same problem he does by not bring able to read. When Paul said ' but you wnet to college.'
The result of the background information is that Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a college freshman who broke records for the 400 meter hurdles. The impact on Paul is tramendous because he relizes he has a collage all star working with him.
doesnt make sense
They both have the same problem not being able to read and do good in school.
Paul is surprised to find out that Mr. Leonard had won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals when he was a collage freshman. Then, he found out that he had flunked out of college, because he couldn't read. So, Paul decided to help Mr. Leonard.
In paragraph 5 lines 1-3 when Paul finds that Mr. Leonard couldn't read he knows the feeling: 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me. I knew them well--feelings of embarrassment when I was called pon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answere everyone else knew.' Then Paul realized he can help Mr. Leonard: ''C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' I said, walking back toward school. 'It's time to start your training.''
The effect that the background information on Mr. Lenard has on the reader is inspiring to him. Paul finds out that Mr. Lenonard had the same struggles with reading and school work that he has. But he still was an exellent runner, making Paul want to keep at it so that he could be the same way. It was also inspiring because the teacher told him that he flunked out of college because he did not get good grades. That would make Paul want to work harder at his school work, so that the same thing would not happen to him.
Paul and Mr. Leonard are talkin one day after practice, and Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard went to a learning center when he was  in high school. Mr Leonard also was an amazing athlete. He did track and field and was very good at it.
That he knows that Mr. Leonard is just like him.
I think that at first Paul wonders why Mr. Leonard did not tell him that he used to be a really fast hurdler.  I think Paul is a little bit sad that he did not know about this.  Once Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard has a hard time reading too Paul begins to fell really empathetic towards Mr. Leonard.
The effect the background information about Mr. Leonard had on Paul was inspiring. It was inspiring because both Mr. Leonard and Paul had gone/were going through the same thing. Mr. Leonard couldn't read but was excellent at sports, and Paul couldn't read but Mr. Leonard helped him excell at something so he wouldn't be a total 'loser.' Mr. Leonard said it sucked to be picked last in gym class so he tried to help Paul feel good about himself.
Mrs. Leonard didn't want him to go to the reading center.
That the kid didn't know about mr. leonard.That he ued to run track back in his days as a college student.
The effect that background information had on Paul was that it made Paul think that Mr. Leonard was a quitter.  Being so good and maybe the best at something, Paul wondered why on Earth would someone quit if they were that good.  If Paul would not have talked to Mr. Leonard about this, he maybe would have quit also.
It tells Paul that he can do anything if he just puts his mind to it and keeps trying he will succeed in anything and everything he trys.
Paul's opinion of Mr. Leonard changes for the better. Paul does not realize he is running for a former famous athlete and so has no reason to prove himself. When he finds out about Mr. Leonard's past and what happened to him, Paul is sympathetic and decides to teach him to read by saying, 'C'mon Mr. Leonard...It's time to start your training.'
Paul was shocked that Mr.Leonard didnt tell him about his past. and when Mr.Leonard did he listened to see what he had to say. When Paul heard Mr. Leonard speak and tell his story, he heard the emotions in the his voice it made paul think about the times when he was in class and he got called out by the teacher to read a story or a book and he felt embrassed. An then he thought about what Mr Leonard was trying to do for him,so he thought about what he could do for Mr. Leonard.
When Paul found this information he was shocked that he was hiding something so big like that from him. Paul was confused that a college level athleate was not good in school.
The backround information about Mr. Leonard has a big effect on Paul because Paul understands why Mr. Leonard would want to coach him. It also makes Paul want to work harder for his coach because they have had alot of the same struggles. I also think Mr. Leonard would make Paul better than he was so Paul didnt have some of the same problems he did.
Paul finds out Mr. Leonard was actually a very good athlete. He went to nationals for track and field and broke records. He also found out Mr. Leonard was not very smart, and that he flunked out of college. This made Paul want to help Mr. Leonard to get back up and get into track and field again. Paul wants to train him now.
Paul had not known about Mr. Leonard so he did as asked. Paul then was asked to go to the gym after school so he went and was tought how to jump hurtles really fast. He then goes to  the track and feild coach and shows him what he can do and the coach asked him to look up Mr. Leonard at a website to find out why he is so fast. Then he learns about a lot about Mr.Leonard  which I think inspired him to do his best and to help out his new found friend Mr. Leonard.
Paul met Mr. Leonard when i started middle school. He was a hall monitor whose job it was to keep students moving along from one classroom to the next.
Mr. Leonard tells him that he also cant read and lost his scholarship for college and couldn't continue to be a racer. This made paul realize why Mr. Leonard wanted him to do hurdles and that the learning center can help him learn to read.
That infomation effected paul by feeling that he has been let down. He looks up to Mr. Grabowski and now sees a fall between the two.
The backround information has a tremendous effect on Paul.  I say this because he had no idea he was being trained by a collegite athlete.  he also realized that Mr. Leonard had the same problem he had in high school but didnt do anything to improve his study skills.  Paul realizes the signicance of Mr. Leonards help.
The background infromation that Paul, the narrator, gets in this story is Mr. Leonard was an all-star track runner in high school.  He broke records and got scholarships.  Paul also learned that Mr. Leonard had a hard time comprihending  reading, like himself.  Mr. Leonard flunked college because he could not read well.     Paul knew what it was like for  Mr.Leonard becaue Paul could not read well, nor could he comprihend things easily.
The reader and Paul share the same mind frame. It states in the article, 'NO other school wanted a runner who couldn't read.' They are both very dedicated to their athletics, however, when you cannot make grades you have to sarafice the things you love for the things you will need to know in the future. In the article it states 'I know them well...I didn't know the answer everyone else knew.' When it comes to education they are both slow at comphrending and understanding what the other students catch onto quicker.
The background information that Paul gathers about Mr. Leonard is that he use to be a college track star.  He found out that he wont the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals and that Mr. Leonard broke records.  Mr. Leonard then tells him, 'I was a good athlete...but not a good student.  We had no learning centers in our school.  I relied on friends to help me get by, but even then the work was always too hard.'  It turns out that just like Paul, Mr. Leonard is a talented athlete, but did not recieve the resources that he needed to read.  Luckily, Paul does have those resources and talent, so hopefully he can make it farther than Mr. Leonard.
Mr. Leonard found out Paul failed out of college because he could not read. When Mr. Leonard found out about this he said he was going to help him get help reading at a help center. By doing a backgroung check he is helping Paul out.
It makes Paul kinda in a way want to help Mr. Leonard. But i also think that its gonna motivate Paul because he knows that Mr. Leonard really wants him to succeed at this sport. Mr. Leonard tells Paul that he was a good athlete back then but he couldnt read. He also said that he went to college but flunked out because it was too hard and how no college wanted a runner who couldnt read. So all in all i think that Paul is doing this for Mr. Leonard.
That he was happy to find out what happend to himand what happend after school. Then he was sad to find out that he had droped out of college because that he could not read. After that he found out that it is a ok promble that you can't read  to it is better to try and do not give up at all.
He gets asked about it in the hallway.
Mr. Leonard shares with Paul that he was a hurderler back in the day. He was a great athlete and even broke records, but then Mr. Leonard tells Paul about his misfortune. Mr. Leonard couldn't read. Paul struggles greatly with reading so they both resemble eachother in that aspect. However Paul is in a learning center to get better at it. Mr. Leonard never had that opportunity.
Paragraph 33 (sentence 1). He knows what he is doing.
Paul realizes that it does not matter wheather you are the best athlete in the world, colleges are looking for an athlete with good educational skills as well.
The effect it had on Paul was that he was just like him when he was younger. So when Paul saw what he has accomplished, then he feels that he can do this.
When Paul hears about how Mr. Leonard had a hard time in high school and collage, the narrator learns that Mr. leonard didn't have the type of resources to help him during his high school and collage days.  Paul felt much sympathy for Mr. Leonard, and decided to help him read.
The author uses many signs of foreshadowing in this story. The foreshadowing lead the reader to assume he is not educated well.       The author begins by introducing Mr. Leonard as the hall monitor. This suggests to the reader that he does not have an advanced education if he was just a hall monitor. When Mr. Leonard ask Paul what his name is in paragraph 24, it suggest that he either doesnt have a good memory or cannot read the pass. Another incident like this occurs when Paul shows Mr. Leonard his printout, and Mr. Leonard responds with a confused look.      The author's uses of foreshadowing allows the reader to get to know Mr. Leonard personally before the information is revealed to the main character Paul.
The background information helps Paul realize why Mr. Leonard wanted to help him and it allows Paul to help Mr. Leonard in return.
Things were different back then. Mr. Leonard was told that grades didnt matter, that he would have all the help he needed, but that was all a lie. He ended up losing his scholarship, and flunking out of college. No college wanted someone who couldn't read.       Mr.Leonards were words that were familiar to Paul. He was embarrassed when he was called on, or when he didnt know the answer because he couldn't read. All those feelings that Mr.Leonard had, Paul had the exact.       Mr.Leonard gave his time to help Paul succeed at something. After Paul realized what Me.Leonard was doing for him, he wanted to help Mr.Leonard out. Paul had then started training with Mr.Leonard.
it has a lot of effect on him because Mr. Leonard is trying to help Paul over come obsticales, and knowing that Mr. Leonard was a national finalist made Paul wonder why he is helping him. then he basicla said that he doesnt want Paul to end up like him and not be able to read. so that probably encouraged {aul to try harder in school and learn to read
When Paul first discovers the shocking new information on Mr. Leonard, he is a bit confused. When Mr. Leonard explains fully however, Paul quickly goes from confused to understanding. The way Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard helps deepen their relationship and makes Paul a little emotional. Then, inspired by how Mr. Leonard helped him, despite the troubles he had had himself, Paul decides he wants to return the favor and help out Mr. Leonard.
He is interested in it. Mr.Leonard broke lot of records and won a lot of races. Paul is lucky to have a coach like Mr.leonard.
Paul and Mr. Leonard are like the same person in this story, only Mr. Leonard has been through the things Paul is going through now and Mr. Leonard wants to help Paul overcome his problems since he knows what he's going through.
It shows he wants someone like hhimself to achieve things he wasn't able to. He can't read and paul struggles reading.
It helps Paul know that he isn't the only one with this problem.  He realized that Mr. Leonard had felt the same thing that he (Paul) was feeling.  And, like how Mr. Leonard had helped him, Paul decides to help Mr. Leonard.
Paul wants to help Mr. Leonard. He feels the same way as Mr. Leonard did back when he was in high school. Hes going to train him on how to read and Mr. Leonard is goin to trian Paul how to do hurdles.
It has an effect on Paul because he completely understands what Mr. Leonard has gone through. In a way, he went through the same thing, and it states in the story that Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar. After learning Mr. Leonard's story, Paul now has someone that he can connect with. It also will now make him feel better about himself because he knows he is not the only one that does not achieve at everthing.
From the background of Mr. Leonard, Paul feels that he can relate to him way more because he can not read either. Paul feels that if he can do what Mr. Leonard taught him, he can be just like him. Also, at the end of the story where Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard could not read, Paul wants to teach him to read just like Mr. Leonard taught him to run hurdles.
The background information on Mr. Leonard that Paul gets is only a way to motivate him more. He realizes he can be a good athlete even though the has trouble reading, because he has a good relationship with someone who went through the same thing.
The backgroung knowledge that the narrator has for Mr. Leonard, makes the narrator respect Mr. Leonard more. He knows Mr. Leonard is an accomplished athlete that knows what he is talking about, therefore he respects and follows his advice.
When Paul gets the background information about Mr. Leonard, it effects Paul because just like Leonard he can't read. But they both are good at hurdles, only bad thing is that Leonard coldn't get through college because he couldn't read. So that could have a huge effect on Paul because he doesn't know how to read.
When Paul prints out that paper on Mr. Leonard he learns that he was the best hurdler in the nation. Paul also learns that Mr. Leonard couldn't read. Just like Paul couldn't.  Then, Mr. Leonard tells Paul how he flunked out of college. Paul realizes how important reading is and that he can overcome any obstacle.
When Paul gets background information on Mr. Leonard, he feels that he can relate to Mr. Leonard. Since both of them couldn't read in school and wre both great runners. It also determines Paul to do better in school and track.
the information that paul learns about Mr. Leonared makes paul want to be better in the sport that he wants to be in and try out.
Paul figures out that Mr. Leonard was a really good track athlete but he could not read very well.  Paul didn't understand how he got to college. Paul decided to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read.  'C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' I said, walking back toward school. 'It's time to start your training.'
Mr. Leonard handed the paper back and looked at the ground, his brow furrowed, his voice cracked as he spoke.
It shows him you can be good at one thing but then at another you might not do so well. People are good at different things and noone can do everything. It kinda gives him the push to do what he loves to do!
Mr. Leonard eventually tells Paul that he also had difficulties reading and doing school work in general when he was Paul's age. However, he was a good runner. His athletic ability got him into college but later, as a result of his lack of academic ability, he was kicked out. Paul could very much relate to Mr. Leonard's words. When Mr. Leonard told him all of this, Paul was then encouraged to help him learn academically, considering Mr. Leonard had help him achieve success in running the hurdles.
'But you went to college', Paul seems as if he's supprised.
It changes Paul whole outllook on Mr. Leonard and he feels sorry for him. In fact, he feels so bad for him that he starts training with him at end of the passage.
It helps Paul find out who Mr. Leonard is. It also helps him understand how similar each of them are to each other.
He probably does not understand why a man who was such a great athlete is checking for hall passes at a high school. When he asks why he never told him he realises that he is pretty much in the same situation that Mr. Leonard was in.
Paul is a student that has trouble reading and he takes part in a remedial reading program that allows him to get help on reading a couple of times a week.  he would leave english early to go to this program and every time Mr. Leonard saw him he would ask were he was going and check his hall pass so that he could make sure that he was going to the right place.     When Mr. Leonard asked Paul to stay after school one day and meet him in the gym Paul said ok becuase he would take any route that didnt lead to doing homework.  Once Paul got to the Gym he was asked by Mr. Leonard whether he enjoyed basketball and he nodded his head not so he took him outside to the track and had him jump over some hurdles.  When he was finished he said that was aweful but Mr. Leonard said that it was good and he would get better as he practiced so he told Paul to show up tommorow with running shows and a pair of shorts.     I began to wonder why Mr. Leonard was helping him like this and once he met the high school track coach and he told him to look Mr. Leonard up he found out that he was a very accomplished track runner back in college and he fluncked out of college becuase the scouts did not care about grades and so he had to do harder work and couldnt do it even with the tutors help.       Paul began to realize that Mr. Leonard and himself are alot alike and he wanted to help a child reach his potential athletically, since Paul and already sawt help in his learning troubles.
I think the background information of Mr. Leonard inspired Paul. After Paul found out that Mr. Leonard was a star track runner, he was shocked that Mr. Leonard had not already told him. Paul decided that he wanted to help Mr. Leonard to learn how to read because afterall Mr. Leonard was helping him become a track runner. This helps Paul relate to Mr. Leonard better because they both have reading issues and are good track runners.
The effect that the background information has on Paul makes him see Mr. Leonard as an inspiration. The information allows Paul to personally see himself in Mr. Leonard and he compares himself to him. For instance, when he reads the information from the website about Mr. Leonard, he is astonished by his accomplishments. Once Mr. Leonard tells Paul about his past, Paul is inspired by his words. Once the information has sunk in to Paul's mind, he uses Mr. Leonard's story to motivate himselft to be better than Mr. Leonard has turned out to be.
He is familiar with the things that Mr. Leonard had went through. Neither of them can read very well. Paul feels compelled to help Mr. Leonard with his reading skills since he helped Paul improve his running ability.
I  think paul knowing about Mr. leonard is a good thing it shuold make paul want to strive to trie harder so he doesnt end up in the same situation as Mr. Leonard.
He was intrigued by the efforts of Mr. Leonard and was motivated by him even though he flunked out. Because Mr. Leonard flunked, he had the same feelings about his school work and being embarrassed.  In the last sentence, Paul says, ''C'mon, Mr. Lenoard. It's time to start your training.'' He want's to help him to excel at something as Mr. Leonard had for him.
The effect that the background information that Paul finds on Mr.Leonard is shocking to Paul. He wanted to why Mr.Leonard wouldn't tell him about about Mr.Leonard being the star athelet when he was in high school. When Paul meets up with Mr.Leonard he asks him, ' Why didn't you tell me about this?' Mr.Leonard then goes on with his story about how he use to be like Paul and flunked out of college because of his grades and how he was told in high school that he couldn't do track anymore because of his grades and that in college they would have tutors for him.
Paul does not know what Mr. Leonard did before he worked at the school. Paul is amazed when he learns that Mr. Leonard ran track in college and set national records as a freshman. Mr. Leonard then says he wasn't a good student and his running career was ended because of it. Paul realizes how important it is to be good in school and offers to repay Mr. Leonard for his time by teaching him how to read.
The high school track and field coach automatcially assumed that Leonard Grabowski was the person that was helping Paul with track. He also gives Paul a piece of paper with a website URL and tells him to do a search for Grabowski. This search pulls up information about Leonard and how good he was at the hurdles his freshman year in college. Paul asked Leonard what had happened after Leonard had the best race of his life. Leonard told Paul that he was a good athelete, but he didn't know how to read, so he was a horrible student. This was touching to Paul because now he had someone else to relate to since Leonard didn't know how to read either. The information that Paul got will push him harder to learn how to read.
The effect that the background information about Mr. Leonard has on Paul is to try harder. When Paul showed Mr. Leonard that he knew about his times in college, Mr. Leonard told Paul how hard it was
paul feels just like mr. leonard felt in high school and college.
The information that Paul gets helps him understand why Mr. Leonard was sympathetic for him. Mr. Leonard, like Paul, had trouble reading. He also had potentinal to be a star track athlete. However, Mr. Leonard had no chance to receive any help with his reading issues and as such was not able to make it. At the end of the story, it's implied that Paul was going to help Mr. Leonard with his reading, just like Mr. Leonard helped Paul with his track prowess.
It surprises him because Mr. Leonard never told him about how he was a college track star. It also makes him very excited that he is being coached by a college star.
Paul understands now that the reason Mr. Leonard wants to help Paul is because he too couldnt read when he was in High School. And realizes that they are a lot a like
Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a big track star, and that he could not read. So, Paul believes that Mr. Leonard is helping him because he knows what its like not to read and to be picked on and flunk out of school.
after Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard can't read. Paul decides to help Mr.Leonard the same way that Mr. Leonard helped him.
Paul wants to be like Mr. lenard now. So he askes Mr.lenard about his college track days.
Paul was influenced by Mr. Leonard trying to help him, and it was more helpful to Paul to see that Mr. Leonard had struggled with the same pronlems that Paul himselkf struggles with.  It  means more when someone helps you overcome that one thing that they also had problems doing.  An example would be, Mr. Leonard doesn't help Paul learn to read, but he starts to train him in hurdles, helping him learn how to over come obsticals.
When Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard had broken records, in track and field, and had gone to college, he wondered why Mr. Leonard had never shared said information with him. When he asked Mr. Leonard about it, he discovered that, much like himself, Mr. Leonard had trouble reading and learning in school.After discovering that he had many things in common, academically, with Mr. Leonard, Paul decided that he would help Mr. Leonard much like Mr. Leonard had voluntarily helped him. He began 'training' Mr. Leonard to read well.
Paul was going to help the teacher with things he needed help on.  he did this by walkin towards the school telling Mr. leonard it was time for his training.
Paul didnt know why Mr. Leonard didnt tell him bout his past as being a track star. When Paul asked its because he had the same problem Paul has.
When Paul discovered what Mr. Leonard had accomplished in his life, it gave him hope and courage to do the same. He was dtermined to be a better athlete. He wanted to prove he could be a pro athlete one day and make everyone proud of him.
Some of the effects in the storty was in the back grond information 'i was a good athlete,' he said softly ,' but not a good student. we had ne learning centers in our school. he relied on friends to help him get by.
they are kinda alike in ways because Mr. Leonard cannot read well and neither can Paul.
In the story Paul seemed suprised that Mr. leonard had been a former track runner and that he was good at the hurtles.
Paul thinks the Mr. Leonard is just a hall moniter and paul does not know that Mr. Leonrad had anything to do with being a track star.
The information that he finds out about Mr. Leonard shocks paul. When he finds out Mr. Leonard was a national champion he is astounded and later when he finds out the reason he quit is brcause he failed out of school he knows he needs to focus on his reading so the same thing does not happen to him.
The background information that Paul gets about Mr. Leonard makes Paul upset. Paul feels sorry curious about it. Paul pointed to the picture and asked Mr. Leonard about it.
He was a college freshaman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. He broke records. He broke records, and he was an eceptional athlete.
Mr. Leonards background information really makes Paul want to join track. Bcause this whole time he was putting his self down and not realizing that it only takes a little talent to become a star Mr. Leonard tells him that he didn't do to well in school and that was something that Paul had incommon with Mr. Leonard and when a teacher or coach can relate to a student or a team member that can bring out the best in a person and make them want to reach there goal faster which is what Paul ends up doing in the story.
Paul was more interested in his life. 'Well, what happened after that?'
Paul thinks that Mr. Leonard was a man that was mean a didn't really like kids.
In the story it shows that he is a nice guy. But he can be a little bit mean as well too. The effect of the background information is that he done track and he ran really really fast. But than he lost his scholarship for college. Due to his grades, even though they told him that they could help him with his grades. But he flunked out anyways.
Mr. Leonard and Paul shared that they both have trouble reading in school and need help to be successful.
The effect that the background information has on Paul is that the information makes him very surprised. It motivates him to try harder though, because he struggles with school just like Mr.Leonard did. He knew exactly how Mr.Leonard felt because he had been through the exact same things. Paul saw himself in Mr.Leonard, and it motivated him to change himself, along with Mr.Leonard again.
Mr. Leonard reflects who he is now. Paul is watching himself in him, that we should be better than he and make Mr. Leonard happy by giving hima job, to become his coach.
Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a college athlete and realises he has a great coach. This helps hm get a chance to work out with the highschool coach.
Paul starts to understand why Mr. Leonard is helping him train and how important it is for him to work hard at getting better in reading.
The effect that the background information on Mr. Leonard has on Paul is that him and Mr. Leonard are very similar because they both had troubles with knowing how to read. Both also know how it feels to be embarrassed by the fact that they can not read.
After he goes on the website and finds the articles about Mr. Leonard, he wonders why he never told him. So when he saw him next he asked him why he never told him about being one of the best on the track team. And he told him he couln't read, so that influenced Paul to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
he was a hurdler back then and he coudnt read
Mr. Leonard's background information inspires Paul. He finds out about Mr. Leonard winning the 400 meter hurdles at nationals as a freshman in college. Mr. Leonard flunked out of college because he couldn't read, nobody really helped him. Paul decides he's going to work harder in school and at track.
Paul probably didn't have that much respect for Mr. Leonard. I mean he had some because he never cried and complained, and Mr. Leonard reached out to him. Because of Mr. Leonard, Paul gained respect for himself, and didn't look so down on himself as much.      When Paul learned that Mr. Leonard was once a track star, Paul was shocked it seemed. Paul didn't know why Mr. Leonard didn't tell everyone that he broke records. Paul learned that everyone has flaws in themselves, but it's their job to find what they are best at.
The information about Mr. Leomard gets the narrator wondering why if Mr. Leomard was such a good runner, then why is he a school monitor. It makes Paul mysterious about Mr. Leomard in a way also, because Mr. Leonard is too good of an athelete to be a hallway monitor.
The information that Paul obtained about Mr. Leonard probably confused and suprised Paul at the same time. He was most likely excited to learn that the person who has been training him was a record breaking college runner, but confused because Mr. Leonard never told him.
The background information uncovered has a positive effect on the relationship between paul and Mr.Leonard. You can tell this by the last line where it is incinuated that after they practice track they will practice reading together.
The effect the background information ahas in Paul is that when Mr. Leonard was telling Paul all the things that was wrong, it reminded Paul of himself. When Mr. Leonard said that he couldn't read and that he wasn't smart enough to make it through college. Paul got a glimpse of his future. Paul knew that the only reason that happened to him was that he never seeked help, so that is why he told Mr. Leonard his training is to begin.
When Paul gets information about Mr, Leonard from his past he is shocked at first. He is more sympathetic towards Mr. Leonard, so he decides to help hi out by trainging him again like how he trained Paul. from the passage Paul says to Mr. leonard walking towards school ' its time to start your trainging.
The backgroung information that Paul learns about Mr. Leonard makes Paul feel better about himself. Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard in the same ways since they both have trouble with reading.
Mr. Leonard is a quiet man about himself and doesn't mention himself or his past much throughout the story. The track coach gives Paul a website to go look up about Mr. Leonard. Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a national 400 meter hurdle champion as a freshman in college. Paul wants to know why he didn't keep running throughout college, but then he finds out that Mr. Leonard did not know how to read that well himself and flunked out of college.
Paul did not know about Mr. Leonard being a track star in high school, so when the track coach gave Paul the website to check out, he asked Mr. leonard why he never told Paul he was a track star. Paul is glad to have a real athlete to help him, so now it's his turn to help Mr. leonard.
Paul says, 'the wnotions in Mr. Leonard's words wew all too familiar to me. i knew them well feelings of embarrassment.
The background information startled paul when he herd about Mr. leonard
It shows him that he can still acomplish things even if he has trouble reading. He wants to help Mr. Leaonard learn how to read that way he will not feel ashamed talking abou his college exsperience. Paul tells Mr. Leonard 'Its time to start your training.'
He starts to want to work out with the team after finding out, it has a great impact on his decision to continue with runing.
Paul is confused and somewhat angry. 'why didn't you tell me about this?' Paul was astonished at the fact that Mr. Leonard would not tell him about such an amazing achomplishment. Mr. Leonard replied with comments such as 'I was a good athlete, but not a good student.' 'No other school wanted a runner who couldn't read.' Paul felt as if he had some of Mr. Leonard's qualities in him, and since Mr. Leonard help him he should return the favor. 'It's time too start you training.'
Mr. Leanard was a hall monator in middle school. he was select few in a leraning program. He also worked with a tutor. He wroked with Mr. leonard with track.
Mr. Leonard was a poor reader and the effect that background information has on Paul the emotions in Mr. Leonard words were all to familiar they knew them well.
I think the effect on Paul is huge. Considering that somebody of that skill is taking their time to help him overcome 'obstacles' in his life. The story shows this when Mr. Leonard asks what Paul is doing after school and then taking time to bring him to the track and train with him.
Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard could not read just like himself. And also that Mr. Leonard was a track star. It made Paul feel honored to be taught by a track and field legend.
When Paul learns that Mr. Leonard used to be a record-breaking track star his freshman year in college, it opens up a whole new perspective of him. He realizes why Mr. Leonard has been helping him and decides that he too can help Mr. Leonard overcome obstacles in his life.
Paul becomes fast at the 400m hurdles and Mr. Leonard broke records as a freshman at nationals but they both can't read and Mr. Leonard failed out of college beccause of it. and it shocks paul greatly cause now he is put into an identical postion.
The information effected Paul because Mr. Leonard is a great athlete. Mr. Leonard was very good in school and he fluncked out of college because of his grades. Mr. Leonard inspired Paul because they are very similar, Paul was bad at school also and Paul is also a great athlete. It gave Paul so inspiration in life to succeed.
Paul is shocked when he finds out who Mr. Leonard realy is.  Then when Paul learns that Mr. Leonard cant read either he has remorse for him.  Paul new his pain all to well and thats why he decided to help Mr. Leonard learn to read.
Paul figures out more about Mr. Leonard's past and an explanation why he was coaching Paul in track. Paul then wants to know about why Mr. Leonard stopped doing track in college.
They like to play sports and they dont know how to read
The effect that the background information has on Paul was that he became motivated for something he had never done before. He had felt like he had something in common with Mr. Leonard. Mr. Leonard went through the same troubles as Paul is now. Mr. Leonard said that he could not read either.
Paul wonders why Mr. Leonard never told him about being a champion at hurdling. He finds out that Mr. Leonard didn't tell him because he was ashamed that he had flinked out of college because he couldn't read.
The background information Paul aquires allows Paul to understand him more and where Mr. Leonard is coming from. It motivates Paul to work hard at hurdles and to keep working hard for his grades.
Paul feels that Mr. Leonard and him have so much in common. Paul has trouble reading and the reason Mr. Leonard didn't know his name was because he was a poor reader as well. After Paul found out about Mr. Leonard it made him feel comfortable knowing that he wasn't alone in his situation and someone just as great as Mr. Leonard struggled as well.
Because pauls coach child life is simmilar to his as in a good runner but a bad reader....
Paul is very impressed by Mr. Leonard's track talents. He feels very empathetic for Mr. Leonard when he learns he can't read because Paul has the same problem. Paul has even felt the same feelings of embarrassment when asked to read aloud, for this reason he feels for Mr. Leonard.
When paul found out that Mr. Leonard was a track star in collage he was amazed by his discovery. When Paul saw Mr. Leonard the next day Paul asked him about the printout that Paul had printed out the night before then Mr. Leonard explain the first parts of his track career. The Paul asked him what else happened and Mr. Leonard explain that he copied off his friends in highschool and didn't do hardly any of the work but once he got the collage he didn't know what to do so therefore he lost his scholarship and flunked out of collage.
Paul is shocked by the information about Mr. Leonard. In paragraph 45, Paul explains that Mr. Leonards emotions are similar to his own.
In the story Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was just like him in school; Couldnt read. Paul was all too familiar with the words Mr. Leonard had said. Mr. Leonard had flunked out of school, and lost his scholarship. Paul is willing to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read, and Mr.Leonard is willing to help Paul get a scholarship.
At first, Pault just thinking Mr. Leonard is a hall monitor, gets him motivated to try doing hurdles. As the story progresses and  the learns that he has trouble ready just as Paul does he feals closer to him and even more motivated. The more things he learns about him the more motivated he becomes. Nearing the end of the story when Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was actually a collage choach he became even more motivated. Pretty much everything Mr. Leonard did, helped motivate Paul.
Paul feels empathetic towards Mr. Leonard's predicament, as he knows what it is like to feel embarrassed over reading. Paul comes to understand why Mr. Leonard wants Paul to keep trying and to keep working hard, and Paul greatfully accepts.
The effect this had on Paul was good. He wanted to start to help Mr. Leonard. Paul said that is was time for Mr. Leonard's training. This was a good thing because Mr. Leonard's life is a lot like Pauls, so he feels he can be the same. He knows he should learn to read then he can excel in the hurdles like Mr. Leonard. This had great impact on Paul.
paul had that familiar incident when he couldnt read and like Mr. Leonard,he really felt for him .
Near the end of the story Paul visits the website Mr. Leonard tells him to go to, and Paul is amazed Mr. Leonard was a track star in college. Mr. Leonard tells Paul that he flunked out of college and lost his colleg scholarship because he couldn't read, and Paul was empathetic and in return decides to teach Mr. Leonard how read since he helped Paul in excelling at hurdling.
From what I read, the backround check helped Paul feel better for himself. When Mr. Leonard told him he flunked out of college, because they didn't have a learning center. So he relied on his friends to help him pass. When Paul learned that he felt bad for Mr. Leonard. Paul decided to start training with Mr. Leonard to make him feel good about himself and show him that he did learn something.
Paul was impressed by Mr. Leonard's record as a college track star which is evident by Paul's interest and impressed tone when he confronted Mr. Leonard.  When Mr. Leonard informed Paul of his reading disability, Paul sympathized with Mr. Leonard's emotions of embarrassment.  The challenge and talent that Mr. Leonard had in common with Paul inspired Paul to return Mr. Leonard's generosity with his time, so Paul will likely teach Mr. Leonard to read.
Paul learned about Mr. Leonard from the high school track coach in the story. He learned of the site on the internet and look it up giving fim the information that Mr. Leonard was a very talented college hurdler that later he found out couldn't read. Paul then finds out that Mr. Leonard was kicked out of college and cound't get into another one because he couldn't read.
The background information effects paul because it shows paul what Mr.leonard was when he was at his age. They both had problems with reading and they both were good runners. Paul learns that Mr.leonard gotten kicked out of college for not being able to read and had to give up his scholarship. This is what effects Paul and he would learn from Mr.leonard mistakes and become a better reader.
Finding out about Mr. Leonard's past has a big effect on Paul. It makes Paul feel less alone because Mr. Leonard really does know what he is going through. In pharagraph 25, Paul says that he understands what Mr. Leonard went through in high school and college. This new knowledge shows Paul just how much Mr. Leonard helped him. Because of this, Paul decides to help Mr. Leonard.
Mr. Leonard couldn't read either. He was in the same position as Paul when he was a kid.
It shows Pual that, there are hurddles in life that he will have to get over. And by doing themin the track session will accomplish that.

Paul is kind of shocked by what he discovers. He went directly to Mr. Leonard and asked why he never said anything. Paul feels a connection with Mr. Leonard after this because they both run/ran hurdles and have/had a hard time with reading.
Paul sees himself in Mr. Leonard. They both can't read but both are good at track.
When paul found out about Mr. Leonard he was empathetic. The emotions they both had was 'all too familiar' and Paul has had the feelings also.
WHO'S PAUL
When paul gets mr.leonard background informantion he is some what concerned about why mr.leonard didnt tell paul about his past.Paul didnt judge him any different about him not being a good reader nor dropping out of college.Paul just returns the help that mr.leonard gave ti him and tell mr.leonard to go back to school.
Paul is emberassed about not being going to the Learning center and it dont seem like he really wanted to tell him where he was going.  Mr. Leonard tries to help him with some stuff i gym because he gets picked last.
The effect it has on Paul is that it motivates him and gives him more compassion.  It motivates him to take advantage of the help he gets in school so that he can have more oppurtunities instead of losing them like Mr. Leonard had.  It also gives him more compassion because he decides to return the favor of what Mr. Leonard had taught him about hurdling by beginning to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
After Mr. Leonard tells Paul about the past, the expressions on his face seem all too real and familiar to Paul. He then feels that Mr. Leonard has given his time to help him, so he does the same for Mr. Leonard.
The background information surprises Paul because this man was helping him at a highschool instead of running for a team himself.  He did not expect the man to be famous. He also learns how Mr. Leonard's lack of ability to read had limited him and inspires him to keep trying.
The effect it had on paul was it made him understand Mr. Leonard better and it brought them closer.
It has a really good effect on Paul, he finds out that a star athlete comes from a similar background. Niether of them could read and both good at track. They helped eachother out.
Paul has trouble reading, as did Mr. Leonard. Mr. Leonard knows how it feels but does not want to mislead or discourage Paul so he tries to teach him what he learned a long time ago by training him to be the best he can be.
The information effects Paul because Mr. Leonard can't read and neither can Paul. Mr. Leonard wants Paul to be able to read, because he never got the chance to learn how and he also knows that Paul will be very good at running track.
When Mr. Leonard told Paul about him being a star athelete in college, but his grades weren't good enough therefore he flunked out he started to feel bad for him.
Paul knows that Mr. Leonard had trouble reading when he was younger too. He knows he's not the only person that can't read. If you can achieve a goal you can do anything.
Paul is shocked that Mr. Leonard didnt inform him about being a star athlete and not being able to read. He soon caught on that Mr. leonard was wanting to help him do something that he wasnt able to continue to do since he couldnt read in college. Paul was understanding about his problem since he himself could not read, but was getting help for it, unlike Mr. Leonard did.     In conclusion, at the end of the short story paul states,                'C'mon, Mr.Leonard,' I said, walking back toward school. 'It's time to start your training.'  Now paul is going to assist Mr.Leonard with his reading.
that stuff was going on behind his back and stuff was being said and he found out from different sources (people) and then it made a conflict within many people.
The background information that Paul gets about Mr. Leonard was familiar. Mr. Leonard didn't have good grades through school and also had a hard time reading. Paul was already getting help with his grades and reading before Mr. Leonard started training him for track and field. Mr. Leonard didn't have help with his grades. He is helping Paul become the athlete that Mr. Leonard used to be. Paul and Mr. Leonard have had very similar childhoods.
Paul learns that Mr. Leonard used to be a hurdler in college, and that he won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. When he asks Mr. Leonard, 'What happened after that?' Mr. Leonard explains that he couldn't read, and that he flunked out of college. It reminded Paul of the feelings of embarassment when he didn't know an answer that everyone else did, or when he was call upon to read out loud.
As Paul gets the URL from another person and looks up Mr. Leonard's history he knowtest all what went wrong.  Paul wanted to help Mr. Leonard by reteaching him everything he used to know and what there was to learn.
When Pual finds out about Mr. Leonard flunking out of college because he can't read, He feels sympothy and he knows how Mr. Leonard feels. 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar. I knew them well - feelings of embarassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew.' (Paul, P 45.)
It gives Paul away to see Mr. Leonard as an equal. Paul now can see why Mr. Leonard is helping him and is thankful. Paul then sees how he himself can pay back Mr. Leonard by teaching him to read.
This background information helps Paul realize why Mr. Leonard was helping him out. Before knowing that Mr. Leonard was a college track star, Paul didn't really have a reason for why he went out of his way to work with him. Paul also makes another realization when he finds out that Mr. Leonard had trouble reading and learning just like he did.
The background information Paul recieves about Mr. Leonard actually encourages him to strive to excel in his track and field. In fact, it boosts his confidence. The reader knows that Mr. Leonard's story has touched Paul when he realizes, inside of his head, that his mentor was just like him when he was younger. Then, Paul decides to encourage Mr. Leonard.
The background information that the narrator finds on Paul brings the two characters closer.  When the narrator finds out that Paul was a track star he is even more inspired, but when Paul tells him that he dropped out of college he feels as if he let the narrator down.  You know this because Paul's voice trails off and he feels not go enough.
He (the narrator) finds out that Mr. Leonard was once a star athelete at his college but dropped out because of grades.
This effected Paul because he saw how the hall monitor helped him succeed in a sport so he wanted to help the hall monitor read. Paul connected Leonard because they both had a hard time reading.  Once Paul knew Leonard couldn't read that well he decides to teach him as Leonard tought Paul. Leonard was a great athleet but got kicked out of school when he flunked out of school.
The effect that the background information has on Paul about Mr. Leonard, is similar to Paul's own life. Paul was one of the few selected to go to the learning center, and then when Paul found out that Mr. Leonard flunked college, that effect gave them simularities. The effect made Paul want to work harder, and he took Mr. Leonard to the learning center with him.
he is black mailing him
The effect of the background information was that Paul was understanding of how it feels to be the outcast that can not read and needed the extra help. I believe that only made Paul respect him more and relate to him more. Even though Mr. Leonard was ashamed of his disablity, Paul was accepting because he could relate.      Also it gave Paul the opportunity to return a favor to Mr. Leonard. Paul was able to help out Mr. Leonard and maybe teach him how to read better. This causes their relationship to become more of an equal respect.
He learns he was a dropout of collage, but was still a trackstar. He wants Paul to do track and also help him out.
He dosen't understand why Mr. Leonard didn't go threw with college. He then realizes that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college because he couldn't read. The narrator knows why Mr. Leonard is helping him, he just want to see the narrator acomplish somthing great. He knows how it feels to not be able to read, he understands how it isn't fun getting picked last in gym. Overall he just wants Paul to do well in life.
Paul is shocked.
When he went and did research on Mr. Leonard he found that he was a great runner in college and wanted to be like him.refferring to thirty-eight he told him that he was a college freshman and he won the four-hundred meter hurdles and that inspired him deeply.
The effect the background information had on Paul was that Paul knew how Mr.leonard's felt about not being able to read, and about being an outcast on things he couldn't do. paul knew the emotions in Mr.Leonard's words, they were all to familiar to  Paul. He knew them well-feelings of embarrassment.
1) It gives/shows Paul confidence and a lot of answers in life. He figured out why Mr, Leonard asked him what his name was, even though he read his hall way pass everyday. Also, whenever Mr. Leonard asked Paul if he plays basketball he said no, so he took him out to the track where he is a suprerstar at. Mr. leonard was just like Paul but he wants Paul to succsed in life and college.
Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard jumped herdles in college, and paul now belives that he can do it as well.
Mr. Leonard is a hall monitor that becomes A coach for the school.
He was suprised. In fact, he pulled out the document about Mr. Leonard's accomplishment and showed it to him. It confuses Paul because Mr.Leonard didn't seem happy about seeing the printout. It turned out that Mr.Leonard was a great at hurdles, but wasn't the best student. Because he couldn't read.
The information makes paul relize that Mr. Leonard is like him in many ways, and that he must try hard to do his best.
The background information on Mr. Leonard helped Paul realize things about him.  He also realizes that Mr. Leonard is just trying to be his friend because they have been through the same stuff.  When Paul understands that Mr. Leonard is a cool guy, he lightens up and accepts him.
Paul has sympathy for Mr. Leonard because they both have problems with learning. They both have struggled with the obstacle of learning how to read. Paul reacts in a caring way when he finds out Mr. Leonard struggles with reading. Paul decides to take Mr. Leonard to the reading center to help him learn how to read. He does this because he is returning a favor. Mr. Leonard helped him come out of his shell with hurdling so it was only fitting that Paul would help him out with reading.
The effect that has on Paul is it makes him feel empathetic towards Mr. Leonard.  Paul understands how Mr. Leonard feels with being one of the only people around who has trouble reading.  The fact of how Mr. Leonard explains how hard it was to accomplish homework made Paul feel a connection of similar problems.  That's because Paul also has had to struggle to get his homework done.  Plus this makes Paul understand how he could turn out if he didnt learn adequate reading skills to not flunk out like Mr. Leonard.
The background information Paul found out on Mr. Leonard were familiar to him. He knew what it felt like to not be able to read, to feel embarrarssed about being called and not knowing an answer everyone knew. The information he found inspired him to help Mr. Leonard learn to read the way Mr. Leonard trained him to for jumping hurdles on the track team.
It encourages him to teach mr leonard how to read
The background information that Paul finds about Mr. Leonard allows him to empathize with and understand why Mr. Leonard is helping him. He realizes that Mr. Leonard knows what Paul himself is going through and decides to help Mr. Leonard just as Mr. Leonard helped him.
When paul gets the infornmation of mr.leonard from the URL paul is quite amzed that mr.leonard was an amzing track athlete. mr. leonard broke records and won the 400 meter national title and paul dosnt understand why he is a hall moniter. that is until mr. leonard confeces that he cannot read, after that moment paul tells mr.leonard that it is his time to learn.
Mr. Leonard was a bad reader in high school and in college. Mr Leonard had friends help him with his work in high school and then in college he had a tutors to help him but it was still hard for Mr. Leonard to keep his grades up in college. Mr Leonard doesn't want Paul to go there the same thing so he helps him with track and feild. This will help Paul try harder to learn to read in middle school.
he is shockt that h dose not no how to read
It gave Paul hope that some day he would be able to read. It also helped paul understand that Mr. Leonard could not read, so he would help be able to read.
The information that is found on Mr. Leonard is a big impact on Paul. He see's that anyone can do anything if they have help. In high school Mr. Leonard had the same problems he was excellent in sports but his grades weren't as outstanding as his sports were. Mr. Leonard was only givin a Scholarship based upon his sports not his grades. Mr. Leonard then failed out of college and no other college wanted a runner that could't read. Paul then knew he was in the exact same thing and he wanted to help Mr. Leonard just as he helped him.
That Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard was a track star in college that funked out because he couldn't read. So Paul is surprised cause he found out they were alike in a lot of ways.
Paul found out that Mr. Leonard was a star in college and broke records for the 400 hurdles. Paul later found out that Mr. Leonard was flunked out of college because he didn't know how to read. Paul related to this because he himself doesn't know how to read and he knows the feeling of embarrassment that Mr. Leonard had. Paul now wants to return the favor and help him to learn how to read.
Paul sees himself in the background information he found about Mr. Leonard.  Paul becomes empathatic towards Mr. Leonard who can not read, and in the forty-sixth paragraph Paul foreshadows that he will teach Mr. Leonard how to read, such as Mr. Leonard taught Paul how to run in track.
The effect is that Paul realizes that he is going ot be just like Mr. Leonard. Who cant read and flunks out of college, but amazing at track and had scholarships. So Paul says 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' I said, walking back toward school. 'It's time to start your training.' This is said to Mr. Leonard to return the favor, andfor Paul realizing how much help Mr. Leonard has done for him.
Paul find out that Mr.Leonard was a very good track runner and it made him excited and asked him what happen after that. Mr.Leonard then tells him he was not a good student and paul could relate to it. Paul then realized what he can do for him.
Paul learns that he must keep working hard and going to the learning center for help or being a good runner is not going to get you anywhere. Paul could see the saddness in Mr. Leonard's face about when he would talk about his ruunning and then how he flunked out of college because the work was so hard he couldn't keep up.
the effect about the background information that has on Paul was shocking because he didnt know he was a track and field champion. He realized he wants to be more like him. when Paul ask him about his background. Mr. Leonard told him that he did but that he didnt do so good in school. After Mr. Leonard told him, it made Paul realized that it he was just like him when he was Pauls age.
He see Mr. Leonard differently after he reseaches him on the internet but not in a bad way. Now he sees Mr. Leonard as someone who understands what he is going through in class when asked to read out loud or not knowing an answer everyone else knows.
When Paul reads about Mr. Leonards life at college, he realizes that he and Mr. Leonard are the same. And that Mr. Leonard is trying to help him get into college and get the life he never had. He connects with him, and feels sorry for him. So Paul then helps coach Mr. Leonard in reading, which is a lesson Mr. Leonard has yet to learn.
During the story Paul gets background information about Mr. Leonard. It caused some effect on Paul once he knew.     Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a college fresham who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals and broke records for the school, but like Paul he had a really hard time in school and had noone to help him so he flunked out.     It had an effect on Paul because Paul had a hard time in school too but it made him realize that if he has help and tries his absolute best then Paul could do really well in school and become better and better at hurtles.
Well he didn't know what to think about he had all these questions to ask Mr. Leonard. He had asked him why he hadn't told him about this, and that he was pretty much the best runner on the team. He had asked why he had stopped running, Mr. Leonard simply replied 'i was a good athlete, but not a good student.'
The effect that the background information of Mr. Leonard had on Paul was that he was surprised because Mr. Leonard hadn't told him anything about it, let alone mention it. When Paul had found out that Mr. Leonard flunked college because he had reading problems, and the homework was to hard for him to understand, he knew that it was his turn to help improve Mr. Leonard's reading like he had helped him improve hurdeling.
It shows who he was really training with when he did not realize it before. If he would have known Mr. Leonard was a former hurdle runner who ran state he might have felt bad if he did not do good one day. Then he realized Mr. Leonard helped so he should help him with his reading.
he is sad. he remembers back when he was doing that in highschool. he tells paul about how he use to couldnt read.
When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard's background he begins to understand how it relates to him and not being able to read. He finds that the emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all to familiar. They both felt embarrassment and Mr. Leonard gave him time to excel in something which was the track hurdles.
Paul now feels that he can still make achieve his goals even if he cant read. Seeing that Mr.. Leonard was a college freshman who won the 400 meter heurdle at the nationlas made Paul realize that anything is possible.
When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard's background, Paul can relate well to him. Paul realize's that Mr. Leonard had given up his own time to help Paul with track and now Paul says it's his turn to help Mr. Leonard.
Their are many effects that Paul recieves after learning about Mr. Leonards past. After hearing Mr. Leonards past story Paul believes now that he needs to work hard at learning how to read. He also finds information about  Mr. Leonard being a college freshman athlete who won records and hurdled in the national race. This effected Paul because he didn't understand how after college he became a hall monitor. He was so successful. Mr. Leonard explained to him, 'I was a good athlete, but not a good student. We had no learning centers in our school. I relied on friends to help me get by, but even then the work was always too hard.' This impacted Paul into teaching Mr. Leonard about high school and decided to step up. 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard, It's time to start your training.'
Paul is suprised at what he finds because Lenard didnt  tell hima nyhting about his past and Paul found out for him-self.
It makes him feel that he owed mr. Lenard so he is willing to help him read. after mr.Lenard helped him with the track.
Paul is effected by the backround information because what he learns he can really relate too.  Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard can't read just as Paul can't. He decides that since Mr. Leonard taught him to hurdle he would teach Mr. Leonard to read.
Paul was not expecting to find out something so interesting about Mr. Leonard. The next day after finding the information about Mr. Leonard. He asked him about it. Mr. Leonard did not seem to excited and happy when he saw what Paul had. Even though he felt embarrassed by the past. He still answered Paul.     After listening to Mr. Leonard explain his past. He felt familiar with the feelings. Paul felt inspired. He then asked Mr. Leonard to come with him. So, Paul could then help Mr. Leonard just like he done for Paul.
He has always looked up to Mr. Leonard, so when he found out all the things that had happen to himin college, i think at first he was shocked but then he heard more. Paul had kind of realized that Mr. leonard was like him when he was his age. I just think it make Paul and Mr. Leonard closer.
The background information on Mr. leonard is like how he was good at track in college and he actually flunks out of college which there for he can't do track and field anymore,
It has an effect because Paul does not want to lose a scholarship if he gets one.
He doesnt want to be like Mr. Leonard and be good at a sport then fail school.
Paul can relate to how Mr. Leonard feels. He has felt the same way before and still does in school. In a way the two are very much alike in more than one way. Both are very well runners but fail to excel in school. This makes Pual want to help himself and Mr. Leonard by putting Mr. Leonard through a different type of training, reading.
He is very surprised he is like him. He is kinda mad he didnt tell him about himself. When he learns that he was good at track he is amazed and doesn't know what to think. It's like he didnt even believe him at first. He is amazed to see how far he has come.
Mr leonard used to be a track coach.
The background information on Mr. Leonard about him being a good athlete was shocking to Paul. As Mr. Leonard went on about his college life, Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard is remedial to reading also. They have so much in common because they both got put last in every thing and no one wanted them because of there remediation.
Paul towards the end of the story is informed that Mr. Leonard was a college track star. Mr. Leonards tells him while in high school he struggled with reading. He also told him he never learned and was kick out of college becasue of his lack of reading skills. This allowed Paul to see that him and Mr Leonard were similar. Mr Leonard effected Paul by telling him know that he can get over any hurdle.
The effect the information has on Paul is that he is just like Mr. Leonard. He relizes that Mr. Leonard is trying to help him be the best he can be. He relizes that he can over come his reading problem and can learn to read just like he has learned to do the hurtles.
Paul learned about Mr. Leonard from the website that the track coach had written down for him. The website gave Paul some background information on Mr. Leonard and this helped Paul relate to Mr. Leonard's situation as a fellow student who could not read. The information also made Paul feel more emotionally attached to his trainer, as in paragraph 45, where he knew the feelings of embarrassment. The background information had an emotional effect on Paul that helped him relate to Mr. Leonard.
The effect that Mr. Leonard's background has on Paul is that he knows the feeling and feels really bad for him.  Paul says he knows the embarrasment of not being able too read. Now Paul wants too help Mr. Leonard learn how too read.
The background information on Mr. Leonard shows Paul that even those who struggle have the gifts to be great at things. Before the background information is given, Paul failed to see the connection that he had with Mr. Leonard. After Paul learns more about Mr. Leonard's past, he realizes the similarities between their situations and can connect the reasons Mr. Leonard is helping him.
When paul hears mr.leonards background information he starts to understand why Mr. leonard helps him. Also he kinda connects with Mr.leonard because he met and adult thats is and was in the same place that he's in. They both had the same feelings when it came to reading.
Paul began to realize how much his teacher, Mr. Leonard, and he had in common. Paul was just now learning why this man had came to him in the first place, he couldn't possibably know what Mr. Leonard wanted with him. So Paul was in surpirse with him or maybe a little disapointed that he wasn't giving the information or the insight on his mentor.
During the story, the reader gets information about Mr. Leonard's track records.  Paul now knows that Mr. Leonard was once a wonderful track star, and he is now helping Paul become better.  The background information that has the greatest effect on Paul is that Mr. Leonard has a reading problem, just like him.  Mr. Leonard helped Paul to become better at hurdles, now Paul wants to help Mr. Leonard become better at reading.
In the story Paul finds out Mr. leonard was a famous track runner in college. Then also finds out that he flunked out because he couldn't read. It makes Paul feel like he can relate to someone. he even says 'The emotions in Mr Leonard's words were all too familiar.' As if he knows exactly how Mr. Leonard feels.
The infromation that Paul finds out makes him feel sorry for Mr. Leonard because he has felt the same way because he has trouble reading also.  This is why at the end of the story Paul decides to help teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
It effects Paul, because he can relate to Mr. Leondard's story. Bad reading skills, trained to get good at track, etc. In a way, I think it motivates Paul to become good at track, but also focus on getting into a good college and using the learning center to get his reading to a better level.
Mr. Leonard's background information effected Paul by making him realize that he and Mr. Leonard are similar. This is because both have stuggled with reading. Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard because in pargraph 45 Paul references a time when he was too embarresed to answer in class because he couldn't read aloud the answer.
The background information he recieves from his track coach to research about Mr. Leonard gives Paul a whole new way to look at Mr. Leonard. Paul discovers that Mr. Leonard was a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at natuionals. He discovered he broke records, and asked Mr. Leonard about his past life. The information Paul soon recieves from Mr. leonard has a great impact on him. This is so by Mr. Leonard also not being able to read like Paul, although they didn't have service learning centers back then. Therefore, Paul decides to help Mr. Leonard begin to start reading.
During the story, Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard's past as a college hurdler. Paul knew what it felt like to be embarrassed about his reading problem as well. He felt that it was fair to help Mr. Leonard. After all, Mr. Leonard had helped Paul discover that he could excel in hurdles. Paul then led Mr. Leonard back to the school with the intent to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
One effect that learning about Mr. Leonards track history had was giving Paul the idea to help Mr. Leonard to read. Since Mr. Leonard helped Paul, Paul wants to help Mr. Leonard.     Knowing his past could have also given Paul a reason to excel in track. Since Mr. Leonard failed out of college although being an excellent althelete, Paul might want too prove himself to Mr. Leonard and himself that he can succeed. Also, if Paul succeeds, Mr. Leonard does too, since he taught Paul everything.
MR.Leonard is a classic exsampel of a person who is focast on his sport and not on his grades only to find out later in life that he needed the grades more than the sport.
You can be great at things but you should never give up on things that you struggle on, like the hurdle the first time Paul did them.
Mr. Leonard is kind of like Paul they both have troube with reading but thry are both wonderful athletes and Mr. Leonard wants Paul to succeed in life he wants Paul to have the oppurti\unity that he didnt.
Paul thinks of himself as not as good as evrybody else because he can't read well and at first didn't play any sports. He seems to think he is the only athlete that has problems with school grades. Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a great athlete but didn't know how to read. This makes Paul think that he is not the only one who has problems reading and is an athlete. This seems to make Paul feel better about himself and helps him decide to encourage Mr. Leonard to start learning to read.
I belive that the background information that Paul found out about Mr. Leonard drove him to be better and live up to his dreams. Paul wanted to learn how to read and be better at sports, but without and education he would not be able to go into colloge and be better at the sports he wanted too be in.
He went to college and was a big athlete and broke the records but Mr. Leonard didn't graduate because he couldn't read.
Well he learns that this weird hall guy or whatever is really a famous track runner and that he couldent read also. This in turn shows that if the narrator learns to read and tries hard that he can do the same, but without the flunking college thing. Also at the end akes him want to return the favor in a way for all the training that he gave him for some reading lessons i guess.
The background information made Paul wonder why Mr. Leonard was a hall monitor. Mr. Leonard was a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles and broke school records for it. Paul was surprised to hear how Mr. Leonard couldn't read. That he flunked out of college because he was never learned how to read.
Paul is very suprised that Mr.Leonard had not told him about how he was a college track star. Paul asked him 'why didn't you tell me about this'.
When Paul found out that Mr. leonard did hurdles in collage  (38 ran 400 meter hurdles at the nationals) he was very enthused.
The background information about Mr. Leonard when he was a freshman in collage is similar to what is wrong with Paul. Paul has troubles reading and so does Mr. Leonard, Paul is a rare child that get chossen last in every sport.     Mr. Leonard was one of those kids in school because he couldnt read, so everyone choose him last in every sport. Mr. Leonard came cobncerned when he stopped Paul in the hallway at achool and asked him where he was going when Paul said the kearning center because i dont know how to read.     Both of them were tired of being choosen last in everything no matter what it was.
He probably didn't know that Mr. Leonard ran track and broke many records. He had to keep that a secret from Paul. So his hopes wouldn't come crashing down just because he couldn't read. He didn't want that to happen to Paul.
he knows how it feels to be left out because of his inability to read or know the right questionHe relizes all of this when Mr. Leonard says that 'no school wanted a runner who couldn't read'
That Mr.Leonard is a good and talented athlete, but a very poor reader. Paul knows the feeling of not knowing how to read. Finding out about Mr. Leonard pushes Paul to read and work hard.
It effects Paul because now he realizes that to get into college he has to do well in School. He knows this now because Mr. Leonard dropped out of college because he couldn't make the grades even though he had scholarships.
When Paul received information about Mr. Leonard he was shocked. He did not know that he was a record breaking track runner, or that he did not finish track and for that matter collage.
The background information that Paul gets from Mr. Leonard, helps motivate him.  It might make Paul, really work on his reading.  Even though Paul is still young, his running ablities may get him to also get a scholarship like Mr. Leonard, and for that he wouldn't want to lose his scholarship because of his grades either.  You can tell by that, from when he tells Mr. Leonard, 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard, it's time you start your training.'
When Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard was a star athlete he questions what happend after that.  Mr. Leonard states, 'but not a good student' (42).  By saying this, Paul realizes that even if you are good at one thing, does not mean you shouldnt try anything else.  Mr. Leonard should have tried in school, and Paul should have been extending his boundries and comfort zone.  Also, it taught Paul that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses.
pau  is a trsck player in high school still, he's trynna get improvement on his track so he can win turnments, also he's a very fast runner to
I will write about why i feel that what paul found out about Mr. Leonard effects him in anyway.     I think that the background information effected paul because he relized something new and very important about his teacher/coach. When he told Mr. Leonard about the url he reccived Mr. Leonard told paul about his past. Thats why I think that what paul found out about mr. leonard effects. They basically have the same issuses in their lifes.     Another reason why I feel like it effects paul is because paul can relate to Mr. Leonard and paul can understand how he feels. Paul and Mr. Leonard have the same issuse with reading and paul feels since he is learning how to read he can teach/help Mr. Leonard at reading also.
It makes paul feel like he needs to help Mr. Leonard on his reading.
he takes paul to different places to see what hes interested in and he found it by going out on the track.
The background information Paul gets on Mr. Leonard motivates paul to be a better track runner.  Because Paul, like Mr. Leonard, can not read very well and doesn't want to end up dropping out of college like Mr. Leonard did.
The background information had a great effect on Paul. It did because Paul had not realized who Mr. Leonard was and wanted to know more. When Mr. Leonard told him about his college struggles and his ability to not read well, Paul felt like he could help. In the end Mr. Leonard helped motivate Paul to try hurdling. Just like Paul helped motivate Mr. Leonard to learn to read for the first time. This effected Paul by helping him gain a new friend and trainer.
Mr. Leonard's background information explained that he was a hall monitor whom everyone obeyed and never thought about anything else. This kind of reputation encouraged Paul to simply and blankly do as Mr. Leonard told him. It even encouraged Paul to obey Mr. Leonard on something as strange as being told to run hurdles on the track field.
When Paul learns of Mr. Leonard's past he is encouraged because Mr. Leonard could not read but still broke records in track. Paul also want to return the kindness Mr. Leonard has shown him so Paul is going to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
The effect that the background information has on Paul is that it makes Paul more sensitive to why Mr. Leonard has been pushing and training him.
It tells the reader qbout him as well as adding aditions to the story.
Throughout the story there are times when you suspect that Mr. Leonard is just like Paul. When they are at the track and Mr. Leonard asks for Pauls name, is a good sign that Mr. Leonard cannot read either. Mr. Leonard sees in Paul the likeness and commoness that they share. The effect it has on Paul is the support he gets from someone just like him. Paul can finally believe he can be great at something and that trying hard is not just a waste of time. Mr. Leonard wants to help Paul out, but the only way for him to help is if Paul lets him. Paul may not know exactly what Mr. Leonard went through right off the bat. But little by little Paul finds out and it motivates Paul to be a better person, athlete and harder worker.
The background information about Mr. Leonard, helps Paul believe that he can get better in track, knowing that Mr. Leonard was a college hurdler.
Paul was disapointed with Mr. Leonard. Paul showed this by saying 'Why didnt you tell me about this?' After Paul finds this out it incourages him more to jump hurdles and have him as a coach and train him. Paul wants to do better then Mr. Leonard.
Paul can't read and neither could Mr. Leonard. So when Mr. Leonard starts training Paul he doesn't tell him his story because he doesn't want him to discouraged and stop. When Paul does find out his story he asked about it. Mr. Leonard explained it to him and inspired Paul to help him. At the end of the story Paul takes Mr. Leonard to his reading class and says 'it's time to start your training.' Since Mr. Leonard helped Paul, he returns the favor.
Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard has trouble reading just like him. Also, Paul understands why Mr. Leonard wanted to help him be good in a sport that he liked because Mr. leonard didn't want him to be left out the same way he was when he was in college.
Paul does research and realizes that Mr. Leonard was a college hurdler who broke records in only his freshman year. When he questions Mr. Leonard what happened to him Leonard tells him that he flunked out because he could not read. 'I lost my scholarship and flunked out. No other school wanted a runner who couldn't read'. This touches Paul because he cannot read either. It makes him feel much more comfortable around Leonard now that he knows they both have experienced similar 'hurdles' in life.
The background information about Mr. Leonard that Paul heard was touching to him. He knew those emotions and feelings of embarrassment. An example of how Paul knew those feelings, where when he gets called upon to read aloud or when he didn't know an answer that everyone else knew. I think Paul could really relate to Mr. Leonard and also so could Mr. Leornard relate to Paul. Since Mr. Leonard taught him a lesson and helped him out, he wants to teach him how to read.
When Paul recieved the background information he had questions for Mr. Leonard.  Paul wondered why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him that he was a college track superstar.  Therefore, Paul asked Mr. Leonard that exact question the next day.
The information Paul found could have discourage him, as well as him feeling betraded an lied to by Mr. leonard.  Just by PAul printing something out an even showing it to him showed it bothered it alot.
Paul was shock to discover that his caoch, was the best runner in college his freshman year. Paul didnt know the reason why he didnt know about Mr. Leonard achievement. When paul discovered what happen he was sad.  Now paul wants to read more so he can be better and become just like Mr. Leonard.
When Paul figures out what happen to Mr. Leonard when he was in high school and college showed him that they were both alike. He believed that Mr. Leonard was trying to show him that anything is possible.
He highly apriciates what Mr. Leonard has done for him. Now knowing Mr. Leonard has the same problem as he does, he wants to help him out just like Mr. Leonard helped him.
During the story when paul recieves the information about his coach Mr. Leonard he has mixed feelings he is some what shocked and paretially confused at first. This assumption is made through Paul asking questions about Mr.leonards college days. His feelings of shock and awe are expressed just through his first question ' why didn't you tell me about this?'.     However, after Mr.leonard explains his journey in college to paul he feels as if he knows what he hads gone through. Paul ultimately feels like he owes Mr.Leonard , and deciedes to 'train' him .
The effect that the background information that Paul is provided with is that Paul realizes that if he tries hard he can become successful. When the highschool coach gives Paul the opportunity to get information on Mr. Leonard, he takes it. Paul then confronts Mr. Leonard to ask why he did not go on to do greater things. Mr. Leonard then tells Paul that he had learning issues like him and encourgages Paul to try his best so he does not end up like Mr. Leonard.
He weent and got his records and oictures and showed him which made him want to help Mr.Leonard.
That you can do anything if you put your mind to it. And you dont have to be smart to do big things in life.
The background information that Paul finds about Mr. Leonard has an effect on him. He didn't know, at the beginning, that he was being trained by someone who had won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals.      Mr. Lenonard didn't want to tell Paul at the beginning because he thought that if he had told him, he wouldn't want to train or try something new. However, if Paul had known, things may have been better or would of had a better outcome when he was training.      The saying, 'don't judge a book by it's cover', has meaning here. Mr. Leonard is the book, and just because he's the hall monitor doesn't meant that he didn't have a successful past. Paul getting to know Mr. Leonard was a way for him to become someone.
Paul is surprised because he never knew that the guy whos been helping and motivating was once an college track star.
It kind of shows him what kind of person Mr. Leonard was back then.
Paul is effected by finding out Mr. Leonard's backround as a star in track is, Paul becomes inspired to do well in track, just like Mr Leonard.
The effect the background information has on Paul is to show that they are alike. Paul does not know how to read and struggles in class. By learning Mr. Leonards background information he sees that Mr. Leonard also had a hard time in school and could not read. It also helps him understands that he is not the only one and knows that Mr. Leonard understands how Paul feels.
That he wanted to help Mr. Leonard with his challenge of reading.It said that no other school wanted a runner who could not read.So that  Mr. Lenord can go to college to complete his goal.
I think that Mr. Leonards' background information has a big effect on Paul. I think this because before Mr. Leonard actually talked to Paul, Paul had no idea what Mr. Leonards' past life was like. In sentence thirty eight Paul said this 'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. You broke records.' This makes me think that Paul will try harder at everything he does, just because he found out about Mr. Leonards' past.
He begins to understand why Mr. Leonard was so nice to him and that he just wanted Paul to do well in track but also do well in school.
He feels like it was too familiar for him and they went through the same stuff. Now he wants to help him out.
When Paul learns about what Mr. Leonard used to be he is suprised. You know this by how he shows Mr. Leonard the picture and the printout that the track coach gave him in line 38. But he also feels more conected with him this is shown in line 45.
It makes Paul and Mr. Loenard better friends because he was helping him train and he was being very good to him and Paul was being good and progressing very well and when he found out about his trainer he wanted to help him just like his trainer helped him.
Paul was a great athlete but he cound not read. Paul didnt know who Mr. Leonard was and Mr. Leonard liked that because he was embarresed of not being able to read. when he did find out paul didnt care until he started coaching him and helping him with his sport.
paul is very simpathetic and so he teaches him to do hurtles. he tells the nararator that he needs to meet him in the gym at 2:30
When Paul learns about Mr. Leonard's past he's at first surprised and wonders why this was kept from him all this time and why he would go through all the trouble to teach him. Once he learns that he flunked college because he couldnt read well, that encourged Paul to work harder at reading and teach Mr.Leonard how to read better just like he taught Paul to be a athlete.
Once Paul discovers Mr. Leonard's background, it makes him feel stronger. he realizes that he is not the only one who could not read, he sees that he is not alone. That information pushed Paul to strive for the better, in the hurdles and at reading. He sees that he has more oppurtunities than Mr. Leonard did, and decideds to take advantage of them, for the better.
Paul understand how Mr. Leonard feels because of Paul own experiences he is going through in his life. Paul experiences some of the feeling with Mr, Leonard because when he was in class with the others students he would have feel bad when the teacher calls on him, but he didn't know the answer to the question.
The background story of Mr. Leonard is something that is familiar to Paul. Mr. Leonard had went through school not knowing how to read. He had a difficult time throughout high school and college. He had nobody to help him. Paul has help, from both his tutor and Mr. Leonard. He feels as if all the help Leonard has given, he should return some of it. Paul wants to help him, just as he helped Paul.
The background information Paul gets on Mr. Leonard makes him want to help Mr. Leonard, because he helped him.
When Paul does background check on Mr. Leonard he is very suprised at what he finds. Paul learns that Mr. Leonard broke records in track and went onto college with a scholorship. When Paul told Mr. Leonard that he knew about he history in track and wanted to know why he did not tell him of his great achivements. When Paul hears that he flunked school because he could not read Paul feels for him because he is in the same situation and knows how it feels.
Because he want's him to find out everything about track and field. and then he find's out Mr. Leonard was a track and field runner and he broke records in college. As a freshman and then he lost his scholarship and flunked out of college, and no one wanted a runner that couldn't read. So he gave up so he wanted to help paul and so paul wouldn't be like Mr. Leonard when he was a kid so he started training paul after school and getting him in shape for track and field. so he can be on the team just like him back in the day.
Paul feels mostly happy about this and also has a lot of questions for Mr. Leonard. When Mr. Leonard saw that picture of him as a teenager and smiled you could tell he was happy to answer his questions.
Paul was working on his hurdling and the high school track coach came up and talked to him. Paul got a URL for the Track and Field website, and the coach said 'do a search for 'Grabowski.' Which Grabowski is the guy that has been training Paul to be good at Hurdles. Once Paul did his search on his trainer he was surprised about the things that Grabowski did.
In what Paul says in paragraph 35 we can infer that he is amazed that Mr. Leonard was a track star in high school and confused that Mr. Leonard didn't tell him. It also probably suprised him that Mr. Leonard didn't become famous because he couldn't read because earlier in the story he was confused because Mr. Leonard asked his name after seeing his hall pass on multiple occasions.
Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a college track star that broke many records. Then a while later Paul has a conversation with him. Mr. Leonard tells him that he had to drop out because he wasn't a good student. This relates to Paul because he can't read that well.
Paul had the same problem as Mr. Leonard. He knew how it felt not to read. He wanted to help Mr. Leonard since he helped him.
Mr.Leonard began walking back toward the school,then turned and asked
I think it motivated Paul to do better in school and do be the best at track that he could be.
Paul thinks that sense Mr. Leonard trained him to become a good reader that he thinks he should go to college and graduate college unlike Mr. Leonard who flunked out because he couldnt read. Paul was going to the learning center to learn how to read, so Mr. Leonard seen he was trying and it made him proud,just because you cant read dont mean you cant succeed in life.
ITS SURPRISES HIM A LOT. WHEN HE IS ASKING MR. LEONARD WHY WAS HE HIDING THAT FROM HIM
Paul is embarrassed by his reading problems but, later he finds out that Mr. Leonard and him are not so different because in Mr. Leonard's past life as a hurdler he struggled with reading too.
After Paul learns Mr. Leonard's history, Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard was motivating him to push harder for his goals. Mr. Leonard was not able to read which changed his entire life. He is concerned for Paul. Paul then understands that he must overcome his weakness in reading because he doesn't want to give up like Mr. Leonard had.
From the stroy Paul has a reading disablility and has a hard time reading. In a simmular background Mr. Leonard was a excelling Track athlete in the 400 meter hurdels. From Mr. Leonard's past he dosen't whant to have someone repeating his failures.
The effect the background information has on Paul is understanding. Paul sees that to be successful that he has to learn to read. And if you dont that you miss out on really good oppurtunity's that will never come again. Paul wants to teach Mr. Leonard how to read so that he isn't embarrassed about not being able to read for the rest of his life.
The backround information effected Paul because it made him feel like he can come over any obsticle in life. Paul came to conclusions that he can achieve anything if he put effort into it. Once he read on Mr. Leonard background that gave him motivation to accomplish his goals.
Mr. Leonard was a great athlete in school, but not a great student. Mr. Leonard struggled when it came to school and didn't have the help he needed to be a better student. His friends helped him out a little, but once he got to college everything got harder. Mr. Leonard had problems with reading, just like Paul. Mr. Leonard shows Paul that he can be a good athlete just like he was when he was in high school. Just because Paul has a har time reading, doesn't mean he cannot be sucessful in sports. Paul is lucky enough to have tutors, and someday Paul could run hurdles in college and be able to live out Mr. Leonard's dream.
It shows Paul a different side of life. Also its helps motivate him to keep goin. It make s him want to help Mr.Leonard. Plus its something that Paul understands because in a sense he is kind of like MR.leonard
The background information that Paul recieves helps him to see why Mr. Leonard was helping him and pushing him.
The background information that paul has recieved is shocking.  Paul had no clue that Mr. Leonard was so good at hurdles.  Paul wonders why that he didn't go pro and didn't finish college out.
The background information Mr. Leonard told Paul took an effect on him. Paul realized that if he tried harder at his reading and at his hurdles he could go to college with a scholarship, like Mr. Leonard, but graduate. It's teaching Paul a lesson that your education is what really matters.
He questions him about it, he wants to know why he stoped.
When he realizes that his coach is a famous athlete his whole attitude towards him changes. He realizes that he was once a great athlete and that is why hes trying to help him. Yet then he finds out that he cant read, this discourages him yet brings him to the conclusion that since Mr.Leonard taught him well its time to teach him something.
The background information on Mr. Leonard had a motivating effect on Paul, because Mr. Leonard had the same problem as Paul, who was also a great runner.
The effect that the background information has on Paul is that whether you are a bad reader or you feel like an outcast, you can always be a success in something.
The information has an effect on paul because he has a way of learning how to read and learning things as Mr. Leonard dont no how to do some of the stuff that they have got to do.
When Paul learns about Mr. Leonard's past it made him want to work harder in hurdling and in his efforts for reading. He said that Mr. Leonard's emotions were familiar to him, so now he will work hard to help himself and Leonard
He waas really surprized that Mr.Leonard was a collage athlete and he broke records.When Mr.Leonard told Paul that he wasnt a good reader he couldnt under satnd why not untill Mr.Leonard explaned to him the situation that the scoots told him not to worry about the grades just worry about the sport and he failed his classes and Mr.Leonard had to drop out. Mr.Leonard wants to set a goal for Paqul to achevie.
Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard feels the same way he does about reading.  He wants to help Mr. Leonard to become a better reader, just like Mr. Leonard is helping him with track.
Paul is motivated by the information because Mr. Leonard was a star athelete and has given his time to help his time to help excel at something.  Paul also is sympathetic towards his coach because Mr. Leonard can't read, like Paul.  Paul is then motivated to invest time in Mr. Leonard teaching him something that he doesn't know how to do.
When Paul learns the backgroiund information of Mr. Leonard, it motivates him to excel both in track and field as well as in school. In addition to motivating Paul, the backgroiund of Mr. Leonard also inspires him to do well in everything he does and gives him the idea to help Mr. Leonard back.
Before Paul finds the background information over Mr. Leonard, he doesn't really think twice about the fact that he could be more than a janitor. After he finds it, though, he feels compelled to help Mr. Leonard learn to read. The parallel at the end of the story between Mr. Leonard helping out Paul in the beginning and Paul helping him in return shows the reader the impact Mr. Leonard's background information had on Paul.
When he learns the background information, Paul realizes that he understands the feelings that Mr. Leonard's words were having. He understood how he was embarrassed that he couldn't read, and that he went after something he could excel at. That's why Paul said he had something he could do for Mr. Leonard.
he knew how he felt because he was in the same situation, he helped him get help at the learning center.
paul feels that he can relate to the janator and is glad to know that he is not the only one with the problem of not being able to read verry well
The background information makes Paul curious at first. It makes him wonder why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about his past. It made him question Mr. Leonard about why he didn't share the information. It also makes him wonder why Mr. Leonard didn't make it any farther with the sport. It brought up the conversation between the two of them when Paul found out about the whole story behind Mr. Leonards track career.
That Mr. Lenoard was a godo athlete but he didnt do good in school so he got fluncked and he wants to help the narator so that he can do good in school and have a succesful careere.
After hearing the story Mr. Leonard has to say about his past, the narrator feels empathy for Mr. Leonard and understands what he went, and still is , going through. The backgrrround story really brought them closer together because it made the narrrator feel like Mr. Leonard isn't so much of a stranger, but someone a lot like him.
That Paul is totally suprised about the hall monitor, Mr. Leonard being a track star in college and being one of the best. Thats been training him on the track everyday. From going to the learnign center during the week and then having Mr. Leonard teach him how to hurtle and train him. Then Mr. leonard tells him why he drops out of college from not knowing how to read and that you are lucky that you have a learning center. Then Paul looks at Mr. Leonard and says you have training to do.
He finds out that Mr. Leonard was a college track star, and wonders why he didn't tell him about it. In the story he asks Mr. Leonard, 'why didn't you tell me about this?'
During the story, Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a track star and that he went to college and ran hurdles. But he also finds out that Mr. Leonard didn't do well in school. So Paul can kind of relate to this. I think that this helps Paul realize that he could be good at something too.
He figures out that Mr. Leonard was a college hurdler which he then asks him why ne never told him and then Mr. Leonard told him that he was embarrased because he lost his scholarship because he couldn't read so Paul then realizes why Mr. Leonard took such interest in him after school. Paul then decides to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
The background information that Paul discovers about Mr. Leonard makes him suspicious of why Mr. Leonard did not tell Paul about his past.  Paul finds it odd that Mr. Leonard would not tell him that he was a great track star.  After finding the background information about Mr. Leonard Paul says to him, 'Why didn't you tell me about this? You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals.  You broke records.'  Paul says this to Mr. Leonard because he is curious why he is not proud of his past accomplishments.  Surprisingly, Paul learns that Mr. Leonard is more like himself then he realized.  Paul discovers one of Mr. Leonards most emabarassing secrets, that he has never learned to read either and that his grades were so bad that he flunked out of college.  Paul then realizes why Mr. Leonard asked him his name that first day at the track; he was never able to read Paul's name on his hall pass.  After learning about Mr. Leonard's past, it motivates Paul to work even harder at school and at track.  It also gives Paul the idea to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.  Mr. Leonard's background information made Paul realize that if he worked hard then he would be capable of anything.
In the story Paul finds out the Mr. Leonard was a track star in college and that he broke records. He also found out that he could not read although he was a great runner. When Paul finds out this information it gives him motivation to try harder and to work at things that do not always come easy to everyone. This motivates Paul to work hard in his tutoring and in the Learning Center. It also gives him the motivation to tutor Mr. Leonard at the end of the story. He thinks that it is time for Mr. Leonard to learn how to read.
Paul feels bad for Mr.Leonard because he never learned how to read ,but he was a good althete. Paul gave him the schudule and he could not read it.When he was in hight school they did not having a learning center like they did. Paul is going to teach him how to read.
The background information on  Mr.Leonard helped paul uner stand why leonaed trained paul in track.
Paul was shocked to find out that Mr. Leonard was a hurdler in college. That information motivated Paul to be a better hurdler. It made the bond that Paul and Mr. Leonard shared, stronger.
Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard is just like him.  When Paul sees who Mr. Leonard really is he is shocked.  'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles ar the nationals.  Your broke records.'  Paul now sees that Mr. Lenard did know what he was talking about when he was teaching him to jump hurdles.
Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard can't read just like himself. So Paul now understands why Mr. L told him to meet him after school. Paul then realizes what he could do for Mr. L.
The effect of the background information has on Paul is that he is that he can relate to Mr. Leonard. The feelings of embarrassment were familiar to him when he was called on to real aloud in class. This effects Paul because he is more motivated to succeed in something, and also help Mr. Leonard in return.
At the beginning of the story, Paul thinks that Mr. Leonard is just a grumpy man who wants to get kids in trouble. Then, he helps Paul learn the hurdles, and Paul begins to like him. When the track coach told Paul to search for Mr. Leonard on the internet, Paul learns that Mr. Leonard has a learning disability just like he does. This helps Paul to know that he isn't the only one who feels embarrassed about not being able to read. Paul also realized that Mr. Leonard helped him become so good at something. In return, Paul wants to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
The information connects Paul with Mr. Leonard and shows how they are similar like the 'feelings of embarrassment'.It also makes him realize that he helped him excel at something out of his own time, which makes Paul want to help him read.
The effect that the background information has on Paul is that he was so amazed that Mr. Leonard won the 400 meter hurdles and didn't tell him about it.  The effect really sinks into to Paul that Mr. Leonard was just like him. Paul states 'This man had given his time to help me excel at something.' this means that he is greatful that someone like him would do something like that to help Paul achieve something great, and right then Paul realized that he then needed to return the favor to Mr. Leonard. By helping him train again.
Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard used to be a track star. Once he finds this out, he wonders why Mr. Leonard did not tell him about his past. He asks Mr. Leonard what happened after the race and found out that he flunked out of college because he could not read. Paul knows what it is like not being able to read so he is willing to help Mr. Leonard as Mr. Leonard has helped him.
Paul is amazed at Mr. Leonard when he finds out of his acomplishments as a runner. Paul also finds out about Mr. Leonards weakness as a reader and wants to help him strengethen that weakness as Mr. Leonard helped Paul in his weakness for track.
Paul found out that Mr.Leonard broke records as a college freshmen and even went to nationals
Paul is happy an shocked at the same time. He didnt know that Mr. Leonard was a track star. Mr. Leonard trained Paul, so now Paul wants to train Mr. Leonard to read.
When the track caoch gives Paul the URL and tells him too look up Mr. Leonard he was shocked to find out that he broke alot of records and was really good. When Mr. Leonard told Paul the reson why he can't do it anymore is because he didn't know how to read and flunked out of college, it reminded Paul of himself because he didn't know how to read and goes to a tutor. 'Hey  my friend, where do you think your going?' 'learning center' 'why?' because I don't know how to read.'
When Paul comes in with background information about Mr. Laonard, his coach is initially is reliving his glory days as a young, talented athelete, but as he continues to tell his story, he begins to feel sad. In paragraph 41, it says 'Mr. Leonard handed kthe paper back and looked at the fround, his brow furrowed, his voice cracked as he spoke.' This indicates that Paul bringing back this information really had an effect on Mr. Leonard. He was embarrased at the fact that he couldn't read, but he knew that because Paul was a slow reader himself, he knew Paul could relate.
Mr. Leonard was just like Paul. He could not read but he could run. Just like Paul. Mr. Leonard wanted something out of this kid so he could live his memory through someone else. He did not want to Paul ot end up like himself. He just wmated Paul to be the best athlete in track and get good grades so another kid doesnt easte his talent like he did.
The boy who wanted to join the track team is or could be the best. It could be some one else thou. we will never know for shore.
The background information causes Paul to feel closer to Mr. Leonard. For example, the two talk in a serious tone about what happened to Mr. Leonard. Also, Paul now has something else in common with Mr. Leonard, a difficulty reading. The background information also allows Paul to return Mr. Leonard's favor of teaching him to run track. Paul can now teach Mr. Leonard how to read and do well in school.
The effect that Paul recieved from getting information about Mr. Leonard is that Paul had felt the same exact way. Paul knew what he was talking about. Since Mr. Leonard had helped him greatly with the hurdles, he felt as if he should help him how to read. So Paul took him down to the learning center so Mr. Leonard could know how to read.
he sees that mr. leonard used to be a track star
Getting Mr.Leonard's information has a big effect on Paul.
Paul was surprised that Mr. Leonard was a great hurdler runner, and became inspired after Mr. Leonard told him he had to lose his scholarship and flunk out because he couldn't read. Paul could relate to him by remembering his feelings of embarrassment when he was called on to read and didn't know an answer everyone else knew.
The narrator was beginning to realize that he was good at track. When he realized that Mr. Leonard had great success in the 400 meter hurdles, but couldn't read, Paul realized that Mr. Leonard had the same experience he was having. Paul then wanted to help Mr. Leonard with reading in the same way Mr. Leonard helped him with track.
The background information effects Paul because now he knows why Mr. Leonard wants to help him be successful. Because Mr. Leonard had been a great runner but couldn't read, he wanted Paul to possess the skills he had in running, but he also wanted Paul to become a better student and have better opportunities than he did himself. Since Paul knows that now, he believes you should pay Mr. Leonard back and help him with what he wasn't good at, which is reading.
the backgroung infromation is about him being a hall  monotor and enjoying it but when thr track comes up he is a really good high school herdeler and knows what he is doing with paul and the coach and he has a good hurdiling future ahead of him.
I think that the back ground information that Paul receives about Mr. Leonard makes Paul happy. He now feels like he fits in with Mr. Leonard since they share the same problem.     For example after Mr. Leonard tells Paul his story about how he flunked out of college at the end of the story, Paul decides to help Mr. Leonard learn how to read. Paul is happy because he fits in with Mr. Leonard and because he can help Mr. Leonard just like Mr. Leonard helped him learn how to run hurdles.
He learns that Mr. Leonard is the same as him. ' I was a good athlete', 'but not a good student.' and Paul is the same way. He can not read, and struggles with his homework. Paul is going to help Mr. Leonard.
Paul was extremly affected by the fact that he knew that Mr. Leornard was doing this to help him, because he didn't want Paul to end up feeling an ambarrassment towards himself later on in life because Mr. Leonard went through the same situations that Paul is going through right now
The background information makes Paul feel more confortable with Mr. Leonard. He now knows him and Mr. Leonard are more alike than what he thought. In the beginning of the story Paul thought Leonard was just some hall monitor that was crazy about checking passes. By the end of the story he realized they have a lot in common, as in they both have trouble in school (reading), and they are both good at hurdles. I think Leonard became an inspiration for Paul to try to succeed, and do better than what Leonard did.
Paul is overwhelmed with the information he finds out about Mr. Leonard. 'No other school wanted a runner who couldn't read' says Mr. Leonard. Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard went through the same stuff that Paul is going through. Paul and Mr. Leonard are the same, and Paul is surprised.
After realizing Mr. Leonard's story, Paul appreciates and respects him more for what he did for him.  He sees Mr. Leonard as someone who is caring towards other people and he wants to be like him.  When he tells Mr. Leonard that it was time for his training, he was going to try and teach him how to read better.  It effected him in that it made his heart open to making other people confient and happy.
The background information about Mr. Leonard influences Paul.  It helps to give him the motivation he needs to become a remarkable athelete.  His struggle with reading lowered his self-esteem, but when he discovered that Mr. Leonard also had struggles, Paul felt more confident.  The narrator says, '[t]he emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me' (paragraph 45).  When he states this, he is informing us that he sympathizes for Mr. Leonard.
Paul knows how he feels, and how embarrassing that it was when you couldn't read or understand stuff.  Now that Paul knows Mr. Leonard's history, Paul decides to help him by teaching him how to read.
Mr. Leonard flunked out of collage because he couldnt read and no other collages would take a runner who cant read.
The effect the background information has on Paul made him astounded that Mr. Leonard was a great track star and had the same experiences as he has. Paul was happy that he made a new friend in Mr. Leonard.
That Mr.leonard cant read just like paul and Mr.leonard was a runner so he teaches paul to run like he did when he was in school.
Mr. leonard was a hall monitor  doing his job helping  kids out so that they can read just like helped paul do.
The information about Mr. Leonard led to Paul succeeding in hurdles and able to be on the track team.  Mr. Leonard was a star in college but he still could not read. Paul knew that he couldn't read, but he is able to keep trying due to the learning centers at his school. If he learned how to read well enough he may earn a scholarship and run hurdles in college with the proud feeling of being able to read.
Paul was astonished of Mr. Leonard's accomplishments, saying that he was a college freshmen running the 400 meter hurdles and winning at nationals. Mr. Leonard tells Paul that he could not read when he was in school which is ironic because Paul couldnt either, the difference was the Paul had a tutor and back then Mr. Leonard had no tutors when he was in school so he had to drop out.
It makes Paul quizitive as to why Mr. Leonard had quit running track and field. When he puleed out the paper and showed it to him he started to ask Mr. Leonard questions so that way he could comprehend what was happening.
The background information shows that they both have trouble with reading.
He is happy to heara aboout the past Achivements od Mr.Leonard. it motivates him to want to waorkl hareder and better. it made him relize what he could do for Mr.Lenoard buy being a good racer.
After Paul learns Mr. Leonard's story, it makes him more motivated to overcome his obstacles in life and do his best. It inspires Paul to be a great athlete like Mr. Leonard was, but it makes him realize that having an education is essential if he wants to keep being in track.
During the story we get more and more information about Mr. Leonard. This information gives Paul a better understanding on why and how Mr. Leonard was able to give him such accurate training tips. Before the author started to give us information about Mr. Leonard we were, along with paul, given hints into his past such as 'Say, whats your name?'. When Paul revieves all the bacground information, all these hints become apparent, and he understands why he was being helped.
The background informatin on Mr. Lenord gives him and Paul a bond. They can relate to each other because they both have trouble reading. The background information makes when Mr. Lenord said, 'No other school wanted a runner who couldn't read.' Paul feels like he is not alone and this makes him motivated to help Mr. Lenord feel good about himself the way he did for him.
He tries to help the kid in the story because he is working hard to make Mr. Leonard happy and proud of him
Oaul gathers background information on Mr. Leonard which tells him a lot about the teacher's past. He finds out that he was a great track runner that broke many records. He also learns that Mr. Leonard had a terrible academic past, and he flunked out of college because he couldn't read.
When Paul did his bacground on Mr. Leonard, Paul then found out that they both had problems with reading. It says in the passage that Mr. Leonard had problems with reading in college, and flunked out. Paul had problems too, but he started going to a Learning Center for help, and Mr. Leonard too.
When Paul learns this he has to find out what happened and when he does he decides to help Mr. Leonard.
Paul is shocked by the news, he gets more interested in Mr.Leonard. He shows Mr.Leonard the picture he pronted out and talksto him like he is shocked. Paul was surprized by the fact Mr.Leonard cant read, and that he was in college. Paul feels the need to help Mr.Leonard just like Mr.Leonard helped him.
It helps him realize that not only was his trainer a track star, but that because he couldn't read, he ended up flunking out of college. It also motivates him to help Mr. Leonard.
It has at first a confusing effect. he could read and he had no Learning Centers to get help and he ened up fluncking out of college, and from there no other college wanted him.
When Paul finds the background information on Mr. Leonard, he seems to be shocked to find out how well Mr. Leonard was in his college past. Leonard had won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals and broke records. At the moment when Mr. Leonard tells Paul about his own struggles in school, that's when he realized how he could help Mr. Leonard back for all the help he gave to him.
He knew how he felt, which was feeling embarrassed around others when they had to read in class. He thought of things to do for Mr. Leonard and finally came up with something. They walked back to school so he could train him. Try and make him feel better about himself and not focus on getting flunked out of college.
The background information that Paul got on Mr. Leonard realated to himself. Paul wasn't very good at sports and was not at all an athlete and he couldn't read so he had to go to tutoring for help. Mr. Leonard was a very good athlete, but couldn't read and never got any help so he flunked out of college and lost his scholarship. this showed Paul that he really needed to keep his head in school and do the best he could possibly do.
The effect that the background information about Mr. Leonard had on Paul was that Mr. Leonard was in the same boat as Paul. Paul had a reading problem, and the information about Mr. Leonard said that he flunked out of college because he wasn't able to read. It shows Paul that you have to do your school work and be good at it for you to do what you wish. Also, it shows Paul that he is not the only person with a reading disability, and you can do anything if you set your mind to it.
That he went to school with paul. That Mr.Leonard went to college with pauls dad.
The backround information about Mr.Leonard has an effect on Paul, because they both have had, and do have trouble reading. Also Paul feels like he is left out of sports and is always chosin last in sports, so Mr.Leonard decided to coach Paul in track.
When Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a college track star who broke records in the hurdles but failed out of college because he couldn't read, Paul feels sympathetic towards Mr. Leonard. The symapthy that Paul feels for Mr. Leonard is from self experience with lack of reading skills. At the end of the story Paul foreshadows that he will help Mr. Leonard with his 'training' or academics.
The effect of the backround information is that the narrator was having trouble in school, just as Mr. Leonard did in college. It also shows that if you do not work your hardest at what you are doing, you will not meet your expectations.
The background information that Mr. Leonard had given Paul had really changed Paul's life. In one respect he felt sorry for his teacher but at the same time, he also found inspiration in his teacher's story.      Mr. Leonard tells how there was no Learning Center when he was in college. He feels confindent that the Learning Center will help Paul. He is also glad that Learning Center is there to help people that are like himself.
it makes him want to do better and wonders why mr. leonard didnt tell him about his college years. when he finds out he wants to help him in any way possible.
Paul was shocked that Mr. Leonard was a track star when he went to high school. When Mr. leonard told Paul about him flunking out of college becuase he can not read I think Paul relized that school was important and that he wanted to help Mr. Lenard how to read.
It reminds him of himself on how he also has problems reading. And that he is trying to do better by going to a learning center.
Paul was suprised that Mr. Leonard wasn't good at rading. He was shocked when he saw that Mr. Leonard was a college track star but, not a good student.
Mr. Leonard and Paul were both not very good at in school. Later Mr. Leonard reveals his college background about having no learning programs and grades not mattering if he was good at sports. Paul understood the trouble and decided to take Mr. Leonard in to a program just like when he took Paul in because he was poor at sports.
The effect on paul was, like he was feeling sad for Mr. Leonard beacus Mr. Leonard was a good runner but he did not do very good in school. (i lost my scholarship and flunked out. no other school wanted a runner who couldn't read.)
The background information Paul gets about Mr.Leonard helps Paul to belive in his-self. Paul and Mr.Leonard are just alike, neither of them can read very good. Mr.Leonard tries to help Paul become a better student and suceeds. In returning the favor Paul then starts training Mr.Leonard so he'll be able to read.
The backgroud information that Paul gets about Mr. Leonard shows him that he can acomplish something if he tries. For example when Paul and Mr. Leonard go to the track and start trianing the boy never thought he was good at anything and he always got rejected. Ended up he trained with the high school track team.
I think Paul was shocked that a hall monitor was a college freshman who had won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals. And that the hall monitor 'Grabowski' couldn't read that good himself so they had something in common.
Paul empathized with Mr. Leonard, because he knew how it felt to be the slow kid in class, and it inspired him to help Mr. Leonard learn to read.
The reader in this story happens to get many gifts. Pretty much whatever he wants is what he gets. There is not one thing the reader didnt get that he didn't want to get.
Paul was both surprised and upset about the background information. He was surpised because he thought Mr. Leonard was just an average coach but he found out through the background information that he was wrong. He was upset because he thought Mr. Leonard trusted him enough to tell him about his past.
After Mr. Leonard pulled out a printout of his old highschool records from track Paul seemed to be amazed! After Mr. Leonard shared to Paul that he was a great athlete,but school on the other hand didn't come easy to him; he seemed to realize that maybe Mr. Leonard is helping him because they both can relate to eachother in one way or another.
When Paul finds our Mr. Leonards past he was shocked. Paul was shocked because of what Mr. Leonard has been doing for him, how he has been helping him through the obstacles in his life. How he is trying to get Paul to over come them. He knows what Paul is going through and he knows that nothing, not even the small obstacles can stop a person who can't read.
The effect that background information has on paul is that he is not a very good student in school.
The background information helped Paul know why Mr. Leonard had helped him build his confidence and give him something he enjoys doing. Paul relates to Mr. Leonard feelings of embarrassment since they both have trouble reading.
he feels confident in the teachings mr leonard will give him in his sport of choice.
Paul is not exactly an average boy, he doesn't really fit in and he cannot read. Mr. Leonard starts helping him in track, once Paul got a spot on the track team it was revealed to him who Mr. Leonard really was. Mr. Leonard Girabowski, a track star. He broke records and even got a scholarship to college, but it was all taken away from him because he could read. Paul could sympathize with this feeling. the embarrassment when he didn't know the answer. He was grateful for everything, so he decided to return the favor. Paul was going to teach Mr. Leonard to read.
Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard is just like him. Mr. Leonard wants Paul to understand that branching out will help him in the long run. He does not need to be so shy. By working hard Paul can accomplish anything.
The effect on paul is suprising to him. He thought that a hall monitor would have never had a back ground like Mr. Leonard had.     Although shcoked to hear about him through the website. Paul could relate very much to Mr. Leonard and so could Mr. Leonard. Thats why Mr. Leonard's gaze softened, when paul said he couldnt read.
Paul didn't know that Mr. Leonard was a college track and field athlete which affected him in som many ways.
I think after Paul read about Mr. Leonard it pushed him harder to run and jump the hurdles, for he was also impressing him and he knew if he worked hard at it like he does with his reawding he'll be able to do it better everyday.
The effect Mr. Leonard's background information had on Paul was that Paul began to feel a connection with Mr. Leonard. In the story, Paul stated that he believed he only did the hurdles at first because he was used to obeying Mr. Leonard. However, after learning about Mr. Leonard, Paul begins to see the similarities between them. Both worked hard and excelled atheletically, but had trouble academically. These similarities make Paul empathetic toward Mr. Leonard and wish to help the man.
Paul is somewhat bothered about how Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about him running track. I think Paul will be more motivated to be on the track team so he can impress Mr. Leonard and show him that he can overcome obstacles.
The background information changes the way the reader looks at Mr.Leonard. He sees him now as a great athlete because he broke records in college.
Paul now knows why he is trying to train him. Mr. Leonard wants someone that was like him in high school do better then him and have a better chance in college. not only in college but also in life.
Paul is just like Mr. Leonard, he is good at track but he can't read. I think that it gives him motivation to work hard to learn how to read so he can succeed and keep doing track.
The background information Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard seems to discourage him. This is evident, because when he was asking Mr. Leonard about it, he looked down at the ground and his voice cracked. He felt that he had no hope since he was starting from scratch and Mr. Leonard was a star athelete in high school and college.
The effect that this information has on Paul is tremendous becasue it shows that Mr.Leonard is a person just like him. In the story when Mr. Leonard asks Paul where he is going and he responds the learning center Mr.Leonard just srugs it off because he knows he has been there. Another example is when Mr.Leonard asks Paul to meet him after school he is trying to hepl him in life.Lastly Mr. Leonard is discuraged when he is reminded of his past but when Paul helps him he feels better.
To let Paul now that he has to do his best in school. To have funny in sports and keep your grades up.
Paul didn't know how to speak to Mr.Leonard because he was an track star and then dropped out of college. Paul also wanted to help Mr.Leonard because he helped Paul with all of his ability that he has now, and Paul is more outgoing. Paul got asked by the high school track coach to come and be on his team. That's how Paul got the information on Mr. Leonard, and wants to try and help him to be out of his comfort zone. Paul was effected by it because he didn't know that Mr. Leonard was an great track star, and he just wanted to help him like he did Paul.
The reader recieves background information about Mr. Leonard throughout the story. The reader knows that Mr. Leonard is the hall monitor and keeps the kids moving, shows an interest in students who struggle with school, and used to be a track star.         By being a hall monitor, Mr. Leonard is used to telling kids where to go and what to do. The kids in return are used to obeying him. That's why Paul never quit when Mr. Leonard made him do more work because he had been 'conditioned by hearing those words every day.'     Mr. Leonard is empathetic towards Paul because he knows what it feels like to not do well in school. He even admits to Paul the he 'lost my scholarship and flunked out'      All of these examples give background information on Mr. Leonard.
When Mr. Leonard told Paul about his background history, Paul could relate. They both had learning problems. Paul decided to help Mr. Leonard learn to read since Mr. Leonard helped him train for track.
The background information makes Paul feel as though Mr. Leonard understands his problems. He says that he knew Mr. Leonard's feelings well because he had often felt them. It also makes him feel as though he can give back to him. Paul decides to teach Mr. Leonard how to read as a way to repay him for his efforts.
When Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a track star in college that ran hurdles and broke records he was stunded.  Paul confronted Mr. Leonard with the printout of web page and said what happend?  Mr. Leonard responce was 'I was a good Athlete, but not a good student.  I relied on freinds to help me but it was too hard'.  So now Paul trys harder in school and on the track.
Whenever Paul looked up all the acheivments that Mr. Leonard made he must have been humbled to be in the presents of, what was, a star athlete. In paragraph 39, Paul seems excited and impressed with all of Leonard's success.
The effect that the background information has on Paul is that he realizes Mr. Leonard is just like him. 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.' Paul is bothered by the fact that they are just a like. He wants to do better now that he knows what Mr. Leonard has been through.      'C'mon, Mr. Leonard,' I said, 'It's time to start your training.' Paul wants to help Mr. Leonard out.
He is surprised and puzzled that Mr. Leonhard didnt share the information with him. He also wants to learn more about him.
Mr. Leonardo's background information relates to Paul.  Paul knows what it is like to feel embarrassed when he does not know an answer everyone else knows or when he is called upon to read aloud.  Paul feels that he is similar to Mr. Leonardo and has a desire to help Mr. Leonardo.
It made him fill bad.
Well he kinda got this feeling that when the teacher wrote him something on the paper saying URL he kinda figure that Mr.Leonard didnt know how to read but Mr.leonard told him that he was a good runner in that we went to college but when he went to college that he got bad grades and that he feild the hole course and that he didnt now how to read. He saying that it was bad for him becasuse it was really hard for to read and that some people didnt understand him. And that he felt like it was embarrassing to tell some thats about to be o the team of his that he son't now how to call the plays.And when he stand up in front of the class an read a book and there some that he can't answer it and somebody have to do it for him. But even thow Mr.leonard didn't now how to read he was able to help him Get threw it now the boy can say that Mr.leonard was very exsired to him so he would never give up.
I believe that Paul was encouraged to see that Mr. Leonard was once a track star, and that anyone can really reach their goals if they try hard enough. Mr. Leonard showed Paul that pushing yourself may get you to where you want to go, and in clearing the hurdles and running faster and faster each time, Paul made that push happen.
In paragraph 44 Mr. Leonard said that his college scouts told him that his grades didn't matter. He flunked out of school and no other school wanted a runner that wouldn't read.
They both have an issue with reading and learning well. Mr. Leonard was quick to misconstrue why Paul was in the hallway, until he brought up an obstacle in Mr. Leonards life also.
Mr.Leonard's background infrormation has a similar effect on Paul, because he is going through the same thing, Mr. Leonard is going through. Paul goes to the Learning Center twice a week to learn how to read. Mr. Leonard was a good athlete when he was in high school but not a good student. Mr. Leonard didn't have a Learning Center back then, that would help him with his grades. So Paul understood how Mr. Leonard felt, he felt embarresed. I think Paul also felt, that he wasn't the only one going through learning diableties.
When Paul discovers that Mr. Leaonard was a track star and that he could not read. I think that he was determined to do better.
The effect of the background information has a very good effect in paul it makes him try to be a better person
He was confused about why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him and why he kept his past a secret.
It makes him feel proud.I know this because the text says.'You were a college freshman who won the 400 meter hurdles at the nationals.'
The background information about Mr. Leanard suprises Paul. This is because what he found was this: Mr Leanard used to be a college freshman that broke records on the hurdles. He went to nationals and won the 400 meter hurdles.     Paul wasn't aware of this and asked why. Mr. Leonard didn't tell Paul because he couldn't read and flunked out of college. After that, nobody wanted a runner that could not read. Therefore, Mr. Leonard could not finish his runnning career.      This would encourage Paul to try hard to learn to read. It will show him to never give up, and always try your best in life.
The reader gets background information on Mr. Leonard, and the effect it has on Paul is that he believes he can do it because Mr. Leonard could not read just like him. Paul believes that he can do it because he knows that Mr. Leonard did it in college. Even though Mr. Leonard flunked out in college doesn't make a difference to Paul because Paul believes in himself and believes that he can do this no matter what. Mr. Leonard has taught Paul alot, and Paul is not going to give up on running track. Mr. Leonard could not read when he was in school, just like Paul, but Paul realizes how good of a track runner Mr. Leonard was, and he is pushing himself to be just as good as Mr. Leonard was.
Mr. Leonard is a guy who can't read and he uesd to be a good runner for a school be because he can not read he falled but one day he helps a boy to a spot he like to do.
he felt bad and wanted to help him out to by helping him train
There was a very big effect from the background information given on Mr. Leonard. The biggest effect was, by Mr.Leonard sharing his past it shows that even if your not good at something, dont give up, just try even harder. Mr. Leonard said ' No other school wanted a runner who couldnt read.' As Mr. leonard says this he also is showing Paul that, hey look i was such a good athlete but just because i couldnt read, they didnt want me. Mr leonard did not want him to end up the same way.
When Paul learns of Mr. Leonard's background, he instantly begins to look up to him.  In paragraph 38, Paul lists his acheivements as a track star.  Later in the story, in paragrah 44, Mr. Leonard tells him about how he flunked out of college because he couldn't read very well.  This was something that Paul could relate to.  He knew how embarassing it could be and he wanted to repay him for all the help he had given Paul with the hurdles.
Mr. Leonard have to look at the background of paul. Because they have the same problem . At first Paul didn't want to think about it and tell Mr. Leonard to walk back toward school. Because it was his time to start training him. And they helped each  other out and Paul realized what he did for him . They made him feel very embarrassment about it because they would call on him and he didn't want to answer amd knew everybody else was better.
Paul is surprised that Mr.Leonard never told him about how great of a hurdler he was when he was younger. Paul sees that Mr. Leonard went on to college to hurdle and thinks that it was incredible. But then Mr.Leonard tells Paul that he wasnt a very good reader and flunked out of college because there was no learning center from him to go to for help. Paul understands how he feels and decides to help Mr.Leonard to read better since he helped him so much.
He was surprised that Mr. Leonard was a champion at hurdling in collage. But at the same time, he was also curious because he didn't know that Mr. Leonard was a drop out. Paul asked, 'Why didn't you tell me about this?' Mr. Leonard said 'I looked good back then, didn't I?' Then they started talking about the race Mr. Leonard had won when he was a freshman in collage. Then Mr. Leonard told Paul about his school life and that he couldn't read either. And that after he was a drop out, no other collage wanted him.
Paul is not a very good student but he is a very good athlete.
It inspires him to try harder . Paul now knows that Mr. Leonard had the same problems he has. It showed Paul that even though it'll take work, he can learn to read and overcome that obstical in life.
When Paul gets background information on Mr. Leonard he related with Mr. Leonard. 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's were all too familiar to me. I knew them well...'
Paul felt the same way because he couldnt read either. So he decided he could help Mr.Leonard out by training him.
Tge effect causes Paul to get nerves.
The background information made Paul realize how Mr. Leonard feels. Paul says, 'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.' This is stating that Paul knows how Mr. Leonard feels, and wants to help him just like Mr. Leonard helped Paul. The background information effected Paul by causing him to realize that others feel the same way as him.
Well Mr. Leonard was a hallway protrol then he help him
The background information that Paul got about Mr.Leonard effected him because he wanted to help him learn to read just like the learning center is helping Paul learn to read. Paul wanted to help out Mr.Leonard because he was like him he could not read but was a good athlete, and Paul didn't want to end up like him and he grew close to Mr.Leonard so he wanted to help him.
then hes ilitereatc
A first he was upset that he didnt tell him then was surprised because he had broken a record then asked more questions about what had happened why he stopped running.
It effects Paul because at first that he didn't know that Mr. Leonard was an athlete. after Paul found out that Mr. Leonard was an athlete that changed Paul. Mr. Leonard told Paul that he wasn't good at reading at all. so, after Mr. Leonard helped Pau out with his problem. Paul helped Mr. Leonard with his problem.
Mr. Leonard is very encouraging, he tells Paul it 'was not a bad first effort, and 'you'll do better next time.' Paul says he gets picked last all the time and is obviously effected by it because it says he didnt want to see more of that treatment out of school.  Therefore, Mr Leonard was encouraging and didn't give up on him.  This caused him to stick with it and stay confident.
he probaly feels proud but then agin sad at the same time
The information both shocks him and connects Paul with Mr. Leonard. They are similar since both of them arent good readers and are good at track. Paul feels like he can finally emphasize with someone for a change, and because of this Paul grows to like Mr. Leonard even more.
Mr. Leonard feels bad for being this big track star back in school and Paul wants to make him proud.
Paul see's that Mr. Leonard is like him in a lot of ways. Like the fact that they both are embarrased about there school lifes. Mr. Leonard had to drop out of college because of his poor grades. Paul didn't know how to read as quick as the other kids did. They also both had to have tutors help them with their school work just to get by.
The background information about Mr. Leonard has a great effect on Paul because he was just like him. Paul was on his way to the Learning Center because he cant read and Mr. Leonard was a good track player like Paul but the problem was that he couldnt read either. So Mr. Leonard did not want the same thing that happened to him, happen to Paul because he knows he had something going for himself until he flunked out of college. It would probably make him proud to see Paul pick up his mistakes, run track and know how to read.
The background information on Mr. Leonard is very powerful. It makes Paul realize that he has the chance to be good and take the next step. It allows Paul to get the chance to find help, so he can go to college and be successful.
Paul realizes that Mr. Leomard is very talented, but now is a hall monitor.  Paul is greatful that Mr. Leomard helped him train, but feels guilty he is getting all the attention.  Paul wants to help him learn and get better too so at the end Paul tells him that 'it's time for you to start training.'  Paul is now going to teach Mr. Leonard to read in return for him to teach Paul to hurdle.
Mr. Leonard tells Paul, the narrator, that he had problems in school, but did great on track. He wanted to show that you can't be great at everything so easily. You have to keep trying and sooner ot later, you will accomplish the goal you were reaching for.
The feeling of embarrassment that Mr.Leonard felt, and the narator had had the same feelings when he was called upon to read aloud or when he didnt know an answer everyone else knew. He like the fact that Mr. Leonard had given his time to help him excel at something.
Mr. Leonard reminds Paul of himself.
Learning about Mr. Leonard's information effected Paul by showing him he is not alone.
It makes paul wan't to succeed more and make Mr.Leonard proud.
In the story Mr. Leonard and Paul had started a conversation about if they were a good athlete. Mr. Leonard said that he was a good athlete, but not a good student when it came to school.They didnt have any learning centers in our school, he always relied on friends to help him get by, even then the work was always too hard. Then Mr. Leonard had embarrassment feelingd when Paul was called upon to read aloud or when he didnt know the answer to the question, like everybody else knew.
im assuming that by finding out about mr. leonards past it had a great impact on pauls reading problems. Paul probably thinks that he shoudl try harder on his homework so he doesnt fail college. also paul says mr. leonards words were to familiar to him. they were both embarrassed to not be good at reading.
It tells him a little about Mr. Leanard.  He finds out that Mr. Leanard was a great athlete but had a lot of trouble in school.
Paul amazed at Mr. Leonard's achievement and wonders why he is a janitor.
The informatioin that Paul recieves about Mr. Leonard is about his past career as a college track star. This information shocks Paul and makes him curious as to why Mr. Leonard didnt say anything to him about his acheivements. It also makes Paul look up to Mr. Leonard.
When Paul finds out Mr. Leonards history with running he was curious why he stopped. So he asked him about it. When Mr. Leonard tells him about not being able to read and that he flunked out of high school, Paul knew how he felt. Now Paul wants to keep running, and help Mr. Leonard learn to read.
He feels sympathtic torwards Mr. Leonard.
Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard is a lot like him. In paragraph 42 he explains to Paul that he is not a very good reader either and he wants to encourage him to stick to the tutoring.
When Paul finds out about the background information on Mr. Leonard he is shocked. Paul realizes that he and Mr. Leonard actually have a lot in common. They are both very good at track and neither of them can read. Paul then starts tutoring Mr. Leonard in reading while Mr. Leonard coaches Paul in track.
Paul is suprised that Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about being so good at track, that is after all something a person should be proud of. Paul says 'Why didn't you tell me about this?'
We can tell that Mr. Leonard is very well at sports and also really wants to motivate students as well. His want for motivation is what caused Paul to excel at what he does. You can tell Mr. Leonard used to be an athlete of some sort by the way he likes competition as well.
Paul looks at Mr. Leonard with a different perspective when he learns about his past. Paul can relate to Mr. Leonard when he discovers that Mr. Leonard can't read and that he flunked out of college because of that. Paul then realizes that he can train Mr. Leonard in reading just as he had been training Paul in track and field.
When Paul read that about Grabowski it inspired him to do better. It also made him realize why Leonard had helped him and wanted him to get better at something he was not so great at to begin with.
Paul realizes that Mr.  Leonard was a great athlete who couldn't make the grades to perform in college, and relates that to his personal situation. In the story, Paul showed Mr. Leonard a picture of him running in college, and tells Mr. Leonard that he knows he won the 400 meter hurdles at nationals.
The information shows Paul that he can relate to Mr. Leonard because, Paul is also a bad reader.
He is conserned for Mr. Leonard. Paul wants to help him because he helped Paul. Paul knows how they are alike in a way and they both need help with something. Mr. Leonard helped Paul with something and now Paul will help My. Leonard in return for helping him find some confidence in something he might be good at.
The background information had a major effect on Paul. Paul now understood more things about his coach. Such as why, out of all people he choose Paul to work with. The reason comes from the article where Paul first meets Mr. Leonard when he is in the hall going to the Learning center and this is when Mr. Leonard compared himself to Paul and saw something in him beginning their relationship. Also getting the background information gave Paul someway to repay Mr. Leonard for what he has done and that is why he said what he said in the last paragraph, 'C'mon, Mr. Leonard. It's time to start your training.' Meaning that Paul was going to teach him a little bit.
When Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a former track star, he wondered why Mr. Leonard had not told him earlier.  When Paul also learns that Mr. Leonard could not ready, just like him, he felt like they had a lot more in common with each other.  'The emotions in Mr. Leonard's words were all too familiar to me.  I knew them well --feelings of embarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew.'  This shows that Paul is very apreciative that Mr. Leonard is showing interest in him, and it motivates him to do well in school so that he can succeed in college.

The back ground information that is told about Mr. Leonard brings intrested and excitment to the story. Knowning that Mr. Leonard went through the same thing Paul is going through makes you think that maybe Paul would be able to be succesful like he was. The fact that Paul isn't able to read and neither could Mr. Leonard when he was Pauls age shows that they have something in common.

After confronting Mr. leonard about the information, Paul says 'Why didn't you tell me about this. the information showed that Mt. leonard was a college freshman who won the 400 meter dash and broke records. But failed out for not being able to read.

The effect that the background information has on Paul is good.Track and Field is a great sport to be in. It help you get good self-steam and it strenghten your muscle.If you get good grade and keep them then you can play in anyother sport you want to be in.

It was a shocker to see .
It shows Paul how important a good education is to someone because it ruened Mr. Leonard's career as a runner because he flunked out of college even though he was one of the best runners as a freshman.

Mr. Leonards background information greatly influences Paul. In the story, Paul is faced by the obsticle of a being a slow reader. When Paul meets Mr. Leonard and starts to train with him, Paul quickly discovers that Mr. Leonard has broke records in college track. Paul is inspired by the fact that Mr. Leonard, a great athlete, is training him. What inspires Paul even more is the fact that Mr. Leonards also was a had a hard time with his reading. By hearing about someone who has the same problems as him, Paul is inspired to work even harder at both his reading and his track.
After Paul hears Mr. Leonard's background story, Paul responds by asking for Mr. Leonard to follow him back to the school. Paul feels the same way as Mr. Leonard does about not being a good reader. So as a result of Mr. Leonard helping him with his confidence, Paul decides to return the favor and help Mr. Leonard learn how to read.
That Mr. Leonard was just like Paul when he was young.
Paul is a poor reader amd he finds out that so is Mr. Leonard. Mr. Leonard flunked out of college and lost his track scholarship, because he could not keep up with his grades. This made Paul feel better about himself, because he isn't the only on with the problem. it also shows that if you don't give up you can still suceed, even with a few hurdles in the way. He knows now how important it is to keep trying, and that some obstacles in your life can be difficult to jump over.
I think that the background information effect, because now paul see's someone like himself. Paul can look up too him and make different disision then what Mr.Leonard did, by keeping good grades and so that he can also be a good athlete.
Mr. Leonard doesn't share important background information about himself until later in the story. Towards the end of the story Mr. Leonard tells Paul that he used to be a good athlete, and that he wasn't very smart in school either. This ppushes Paul to start trying even harder in sports, such as track.
paul i surprised at the information, he didnt know that he had been training with a track star. and he was disapointed thet Mr. Leonard hadnt told him about this before.
He became more interested in Mr. Leonard's past in college. After Paul's findings that Leonard broke records as a freshman in college he wanted to be just like him, as successful as him as well, so he continued to do the hurdles. He also felt more of a connection with Leonard when he found out he too had problems reading, and had problems with words.

The effect that the background information has on paul is that paul get curious.  He wants to know more about Mr. Leonard.  He didn't understand why he didnt tell him about this before.  That is why he went to him to talk about what he had found from the URL the track coach gave him.
Paul learns that Mr. Leonard flunked out of college. He realizes that he needs to work hard in school. His talent will not get him far in college. He also realizes that Mr. Leonard was helping him by getting him involved in other things.
It has a pretty big effect on paul because he has the same problem. So when Mr. Leonard helps Paul out with track, it makes it where Paul can try to help Mr. Leonard out with reading.
Paul was amazed that Mr. Leonard's background information was that he broke college records his freshman year. In the story states that Paul took his free time to print out a paper about Mr. Leonard.  He then ask Mr. Leonard, 'Why didn't you tell me about this?'
Paul finds out, like him, Mr. Leonard cannot read but can run track. Paul remembers what Mr. Leonard had done for him by making him happy with doing track and decidesto teach him how to read because he understarnds the embarassment of not knowing how.      The story states, 'This man had given his time to help me excel at something. Suddently I realized what I could do for him.' This shows that Paul wanted to thank him in some way, and that way was teaching him to read.
The effect this background information has on Paul is he wonders why Mr. Leonard never mentioned anything about it after he convinced him to run and jump over the hurdles.
It suprised him at first, but then later on he realized that Mr. Leonard went through the same thing he is going through now. He felt sympathetic for Mr. Leonard because he couldn't read like him.
The background information that Paul recieves about Mr. Leonard changes his views. Paul finds out that Mr, Leonard has a reading disability. Paul is inspired by the information about Mr. Loenard because he to has a reading disability. Paul says, ' The emotions on his face were all to familiar to me.' The reason that the emotions are familiar to Paul is because Paul feels those exact emotions almost every day.
He feels empathetic for Mr. Leonard because he knows what it feels like. He is amazed that Mr. Leonard was a college athelete. He also wondered why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him about it.
The effect the background information had on Paul was that Mr. Leonard also had trouble with reading. In the article it says, 'No other school wanted a runner who couldnt read.'
Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard cannot read either and now Paul does not feel as bad for not being able to read. He also finds out that Mr. Leonard in college was a track star and that motivated him to do better.
Paul is amazed that the hall monitor at his school used to be a track star.  When Paul finds out his curiousity is sparked because Paul wonders why Mr. Leonard did not ever tell Paul about his athletic past.  Paul questions Mr. Leonard about college and discovers that Mr. Leonard had the same reading problems Paul has.  This inspires Paul to help Mr. Leonard learn to read.
The backgrounded information has an effect on paul because it relates to him and its kinda like him too .
He wondered why he would be a hall monitor when he was so good.
the effect it had on paul was that the coach could'nt read either and he flunked out of college, and he could'nt run track. so he did'nt want the same thing to happen to him, because paul has a reading problem so he's got tutor.
The back infomation reminds Paul of him self.
Paul realizes that Mr. Leonard broke high school records in field and track. Paul also figured out that Mr. Leonard couldn't read. Since Mr. Leonard had helped Paul out with track, Paul figured he could help Mr. Leonard learn how to read.
When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard i'm sure that he is encouraged to do well simply because now he knows he's being coached by a talented star in his day, it's motivation. Then when he finds out that he can't read as well, i feel it motivates him even more because Mr. Leonard was a great track star that flucked college due to the lack of available help. Paul not just has the training of Mr. Leonard and the track team to help him with track, but he also has the help of the leraning center to help him read, and he can be successful if he keeps at it.
Paul feels that Mr.Leonard should not have hidden that he couldnt read either. Paul could have helped Mr.Leonard become better at reading during the same time paul was training for huddling. The background information helped paul understand where Mr.Leonard is coming from, Paul feels that they both come from the same problems. He might have felt that the two of them can over come the problem together.
When the reader gets the background information about Mr. Leonard, he understands that Mr. Leonard was in the same situation as him. Mr. Leonard was a good runner, and he couldn't read very well just like the reader. But the reader was getting help and Mr. Leonard didn't want the reader to end up like he did, flunking off because he couldn't read. It would be a waste of potential.
Paul had almost the same background as Mr. Leonard. Paul  was going threw probems like Mr. Leonard did in school. Mr. Leonard told Paul that he could do amything only if he tried.
The background information that Mr. Leonard told Paul let him know that there may be challenges in life. Mr. Leonard didn't make the grades but he got into college just fine. Mr. Leonard wants to hep Paul because he never got the oppurtunity to be in a learning center.
He feels upset that Mr. Leonard didn't tell paul about his past acheivements.
The effect that has on the paul that Mr. Leonard was a very good track runner in college. Paul didn't know Mr. Leonard got put out of school because he didn't have grade's. Mr. Leoard didn't wanna tell paul he got put out of school because of his grade's. Paul found out that Mr. Leonard can't read. Paul decdie to teach Mr. Leonard how to read.
After Paul learns background information about Mr. Leonard, he realizes that they both have more in common than Paul thought. Paul knows the emotions Mr. Leonard went through, like 'feelings of emarrassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew' (lines 46-48). Because of the fact that Paul knows what Mr. Leonard has gone through, Paul now realizes that Mr. Leonard has given up his time to help Paul, and Paul knows now that he can help Mr. Leonard as well.
I believe that it had a motivational effect on him. i say that because, he did'nt want Paul going through life feeling discouraged like Mr. Leonard did. He knew what it feels like to not be able to read and thats embarrassing. Another reason why i believe this had a movtivational effect on him was because he wanted Paul to have confindent in himself, and over the obstacle of not nbeing able to read.
Paul got background information about Mr. Leonard from when he was a college student and was involved in hurdling. Paul was always chosen last for a basketball team so Mr. Leonard to Paul to the track to train him for hurdlers. I believe Mr. Leonard saw himself as Paul. In college, Mr. Leonard couldn't read and I'm sure he felt like an outsider. Therefore, Paul felt like an outsider when it came to being chosen last for a team everyday.
Paul finds out the Mr. Leonard was a track star in his running days. Mr. Leonard tells him, 'I was a good athlete, but not a good enough student. We had no learning centers in our school.'This influenced Paul to work harder at both track and reading. He also wanted to assist Mr. Leonard in reading.
The information about Mr. Leonard that Paul finds is probably effected him in a way that he didn't understand why Mr. Leonard wouldn't tell him that he used to be an amazing at hurdleing. He probably felt confident know that someone else had been through what he was going through. Paul might have even felt greatful that someone had wanted to help him do something he thought he could never do.
It encourages him to really work hard and make Mr. Leonard proud, and try to accomplish the things that Mr. Leonard couldn't.
When Paul realised who Mr. Leonard was, he related his situation to his. Mr. Leonard and Paul were in the same boat. Only Mr. Leaonard was in College and flunked out. When Mr. Leonard asked him his name at the track, Paul thought it was weird. Only because he got stopped 2 times a week and he didn't remember his name. So when all of the peices to the puzzle were put together he realised he didn't want to go down the path Mr. Leonard had gone down.
The background information given allows Paul to connect to Mr. Leonard. Both Paul and Mr. Leonard had reading disabilities. In paragraph 6, Paul tells Mr. Leonard that he can't read, and that is why he is going to the Learning Center. Later on in the story Paul finds out that Mr. Leonard was a track star in hurdles as well. Paul asks why Mr. Leonard didn't tell him when he was coaching Paul. Mr. Leonard then tells Paul, in paragraph 44 lines 4-5, that he flunked out of college because he couldn't read. This connects Paul and Mr. Leonard. Paul then decides to help Mr. Leonard with his reading.
Paul learns that Mr. Leonard is not vary smart. The narrator tells Mr. Leonard that it is time for his training what means that Paul is going to teach him to become better.
The effect that the background information has on Paul is it pushes him to stride forword and do better, it also helps him realize that even thou you can't read you can still accomplish great things. With Mr. Leonard, that great thing was breaking the 400 meter hurdles records at nationals.
The background information we learn about Mr. Leonard is a huge twist on the story. By learning that Mr. Leonard was a poor reader, we know that he and Paul have the same problem. Paul who we know can't read turns out to be a great athlete but can't read. Mr. Leonard who was a tremendous college athlete was a poor reader as well. Mr. Leonard wants to help evolve Paul into coming a better student athlete. He can't rely on his athletic skills alone to get into college.
When Mr. Leonard told Paul about his background, that he flunked out of college, Paul was very understanding.  Paul was undergoing the exact same thing that Mr. Leonard was; Paul couldn't read.  Paul knew how it must have felt for Mr. Leonard to explain his past to Paul.  For example, in paragraph 45, the narator, Paul, says, 'I knew them well-feelings of embarassment when I was called upon to read aloud or when I didn't know an answer everyone else knew.'  In that quote, Paul explains that he went through the same thing, and feelings that Mr. Leonard was going through when he told Paul that he flunked out of college.  Paul understood clearly what Mr. Leonard felt.
When Paul finds out about Mr. Leonard's past it makes him curious as well as determined, knowing the man who was coaching him was a star athlete. He also sees that education is just as important as sports and working hard will get you places just like Mr. Leonard worked hard at sports. It also gave Paul motivation to be as successful as Mr. Leonard but this time he could pass college while learning how to read.
Paul ggets excited to hear about his past, but then begins to feel sad for Mr. Leonard as he soon finds out about what happened to him in college. By understanding that he needs to work harder than what he is doing right now to be outstanding.
During the story, Paul gets background information about Mr. Leonard when the high school track coach gives Paul the URL for a track and field website. Paul learns that Mr. Leonard was a college track runnner who won nationals and broke records. Paul also learns that Mr. Leonard lost his scholarship and flunked out of college.
Paul doesn't like on how they are getting a background check on Mr. Leonard.
The background information not only inspires Paul to do his best for track and field, but inspires him to motivate Mr. Leonard. he also learns that an education is a key part of being successful in the future. He suggests that Grabowski 'start his training' once again, and relive his dreams.
The background information has a positive effect on Paul because it reminds him of himself. Mr. Leonard couldn't read and neither can Paul. They both are embarressed about the things that has happened to them. The background information brings Paul closer to Mr. Leonard and gives not only Mr. Leonard to help Paul, but Paul a chance to help Mr. Leonard.
I think it means, just because you cant do one thing does'nt mean you cant achieve something else just as great. Paul wants to help Mr. Grabowski like he helped him.
When Mr. Leonard was in high school, he was just like Paul. He found it hard to read and felt discouraged and embarressed when called on in class to read aloud an exerpt. Paul has an advantage: the remedial reading program. Paul goes twice a week and continues to learn to read. Mr. Leonard did not have this luxury and, in time, flunked out of college. Mr. Leonard sees himself in Paul and strives to make Paul an exceptional hurdler. When Paul discovers Mr. Leonard's past, he feels a connection between them. Paul realized this man had given time to help him and he wanted to help Mr. Leonard as well. Because Paul knows of Mr. Leonard's past, it has brought them a stronger friendship and it has probably inspired Paul to become a great hurdler.
He understands the Mr. Leonard and paul weren't so different because they both had trouble reading and didnt think they needed help.
Mr. Leonard feels that Paul will not be able to get any where without being able to read.
When Paul get the background information fro mthe web site about Mr. Leonard. He was surprised but then made sense of it because Mr. Leonard asked his name after seeing Paul's hall pass for 2 weeks. Paul is also understanding because her knows how it is to be like Mr. Leonard because he is in the same situation as Mr. Leonard.
Mr. Leonard didn't do well in college.Evidence' Things were different back then,' he replied. 'The college scout's told me that my grades didn't matter, that I'd have tutors to help me, but college work is a whole lot harder than high school work. I lost my scholarship and flunked out. No other school wanted a runner who couldn't read.'
The story talks about his background because
It tells Paul that he can do something that is worth his time and effort. It explains to Paul that he is capapble and he just has to start learning now because college is just as hard if not harder.
In this story, Mr. Leonard helps Paul to overcome 'hurdles.' Mr.Leonard takes Paul to a track, and shows him how to practice for an activity. Over time Paul gets very good at these hurdles for track and confront the track coach to join.      Come to find out Mr. Leonard was a track star himself. He pushed Paul to get better at reading and to then get better at doing something he wasnt used to, but could enjoy. Paul then can exceed in school while doing an activity.
When Paul learns Mr. Leonard's background information he feels connected to him. Paul now realized that Mr. Leonard was just like him in the fact that they both have trouble reading. Paul sees Mr. Leonard as a motive to get bettter at reading and to persue hurdling in track and field. Paul also sees this as a way to help Mr. Leonard just like he had helped him.
The information on Mr. Leonard is about his records in collage and how he failed in collage and so Mr. Leonard wanted to help Paul; so now Mr. Leonard is training Pual to run in track and feald.
That background information about Mr. Leonard shocks Paul. Paul then wants to know how Mr. Leonard went from being a track star to a hall monitor by pressing on, 'Well, what happened after that?' This background information then turned out to be a lesson for Paul about recieving a good education and not giving up. Mr. Leonard never had help with reading and he failed college.
The effect that the backgroung information had on Paul was life changing. He finally found someone who had his same condition that was actually pretty good at something. Now I see motivation in Paul and he's sees it in himself as well. He realizes that was just a minor setback for a major comeback!
The backround information about Mr. Leonard is essential in this story.  The effect Paul has on Mr. Leonard's backround is Mr. Leonard was a track star and that is what Paul wants to be.  With Mr. Leonard as an example, Paul realized he needed to get good grades to be successful in college.
He wants to help Mr. Leonard because Mr. Leonard helped him through the obstacle that he was facing in his life at that time.
The short story is a pome.You can tell by the number's on the side.And how it riten
In Gifts the effect the background has on Paul is that when he hears Mr. Leonard say he couldn't read, Paul says that he will teach him.  Paul does not feel sorry for him just simply wants to help him as his friend had helped Paul.
He realizes that Mr. Leonard is a lot by him with his reading disability and how its embarrassing when they are called on to read aloud. Also, he feels greatful for the time he has helped him to excel in something.
The backround information makes Mr. leonard and Paul become even closer because both couldn't read. Paul understands what Mr. Leonard went through, and he is willing to help him.
Towards the end of the story, Paul learns more about Mr. Leonard and his past. Pauls learns that Mr. Leonard couldn't read, just like him. Paul quotes 'The emotions in Mr. Leonards wrods were all too familiar to me.' Paul could easily relate to Mr. Leonard.

First he talks and informs us about the general idea of Space Junk. 'What is Space Junk' is where he basically tells us just a general idea about it. Then he tells us about 'Crash Course' That is about how large objects or satellites may crash into each other. 'Little bits, but a Big Deal' is informing us about those articles combined kind of. It talks about space debree, and how to solve the problem. It kind of wraps things up.
This organized in a way that tells us about orbiting jank then it tell us what it could be. It tells us next why things may turn into junk and orbit becusae some of the spacecraft may crash and thats the end of that.
First, the author gives a quick explanation of how space junk is created in the passage 'What Is Space Junk'. Here, they explain that when satellites malfunction, they become high-tech junk. In the next article 'Crash Course', the author tells a story of a U.S. and Russian satellites colliding, creating many debris.

The final section tells of the problems with the space junk and how scientists are working hard to find a solution.
The author organizes the article by first explaining how satellites came to be and how bits and pieces from projects or experimnets from space stations get sent out into open space and became 'space junk'. From then on, the article tells about how other bits of space junk can collide with each other and cause tons of damage. Other countries are also trying to get into space but the author of this article is worried that they are not aware of the dangers and lack of precautions they take when going forward with their plans.
First the author explains to the readers what exactly 'space junk' is. He tells us that space junk is actually objects from space missions that have gotten left in the atmosphere. Then, when he has deemed that the readers understand, he gives examples of how this space junk is affecting us. Such as how when dead satellites are left in space, they run the risk of colliding with each other. Finally, the author brings home the point that space junk is very dangerous. He explains that while the objects may be small, when at extreme speed such as in space, they could do a lot of damage.
he organizes the article in what happens to space junk and what it is.then is talks about what happens to it, and how it happes.
To inform us on how harmfull space junk is.
The author uses heading to organize his article. His first heading, What Is Space Junk, gives the topic of the following paragraphs.

The author organizes this article by giving a description, telling how it happens, and giving the after effects.  In the first paragraph, the author mostly explains what space junk is and how it gets there.  The author writes about Earth's satellites, how they get there, and what they do. The second section explains the process of how satellites crash into eachother.  It gives an example of when Earth and Russia's satellites crashed and how they were completely disabled and useless, making them 'space junk'.  Lastly, the third section tells the aftermath.  It talks about the microscopic particles and how they are hard to detect even with our technology.

At first the author draws you in with the cliche Superman knock-off line, but then gets more serious through out the entire article. He does an introduction, a brief history of space exploration and what Space Junk is, tells how dead or disabled satellites can crash into each other, and then ends with hope saying coporations are trying to come up with a viable solution to space pollution.
He starts off by telling about clusterd space is. Then he goes on to talk about how this can be a threat to earth. For instance, when two dead satellites collide it doesn't just make two things of debris in space it makes many microdebris that can hit the earth, plane, or even a spacecraft.
The author organizes the article by breaking it down into sections and talking about different things in those sections, like What is Space Junk? and Crash Course.
good her or she didi it good
The author organizes the article by first starting with an introduction that catches the readers' eye. The introduction also contains the thesis statement 'Orbital pathways around our planet that were once clear are now cluttered with the remains of numerous space exploration and satalite missions.' Next, the author describes what space junk is, and how it was created. After that, in the section titled 'Crash Course', the risks of colliding satellites are hilighted. Finally, in the last section, the author talks about possible solutions and the persisting problem of space junk.
The article is organized by first telling about space exploration and then it moves on to telling about space crashes that have actually happened. After that it goes on to talk about how serious the debris is.
The author has organized this article first by splitting the article into four sections. The first section explains the main purpose of the aticle. The second section explains how all of this space 'junk' has gotten there. The third section explains how all of this debris has gotten into space. The final section explains the dangers of the space debris and how the space agencies are trying to solve the probelm, and prevent damage from space debris.
First they used a catchy begining to start then they went into a little history and info on the topic in the 'What Is Space Junk' section. From there they told of some of the bad that has happend like to satellites crashinginto one another. Then that opened up the topic of all the fragments that came from those two sattilites flying around in space.
They did a great job oganising this article: first they get your attintion with grab you telescope! Look up in the sky! It's a comet! Its a meteor!. Then they get right in to the article about the What is Space junk.

The author made a good decision by choosing to organize this article this way. It really gets the point across.
In the article he tells us how leaving junk in space is a threat to us. By leaving so much of it in space, it makes it difficult to go to the moon for example. For we leave too much clutter in space, it can also be a threat to us from how fast it is going around the earth. how it can damage spacecraft, satalites, or other stuff that goes into space. By telling us this information, scientist can someday find a way to get rid of spacejunk. so that we can see what space is like to us.

The conclusion of this article is paragraph 11, where the author clearly restates his point of writing the article.  In sentance one and two of paragraph 11, the author proclaims, 'Yet the problem is certain to persist. In fact, the amount of space trash is actually increasing becaus e commercial space travel is on the rise and more nations have undertaken space exploration.'
The auther organizes the article in sections of different statements and problems
That objects in space can cause harmful reactions to our planet so we must reduce our activity in space. Why, risk something that can hurt the entire planet? Over the past 52 years, a variety of spacecraft, including space capsules, telescopes, and satellites, have been sent beyond Earth's atmosphere. They explore the vast reaches of our solar system, monitor atmospheric conditions, and make global wireless possible. Has had also major out comes that possibly could harm our planet in the long run.

The author organizes the article into different sections each with a defined purpose. The first section is an attention grabber to get the reader interested. Line 1: 'Grab you telescope! look up in the sky! It's a comet! It's a meteor!' The second section is background to give the reader a little knowledge about the topic. Line 4: 'In 1957, the Soviet Union launched th efirst artificial satellite. The United States followed suit, and thus began the human race's great space invasion.' The third section is what's going on now with the topic. Line 6: 'With no one at the controls, dead satellites run th erisk o fcollding with each other. That's exactly what happened in February 2009.' The last section is why the reader should care about the topic. Line 8: 'So who cares about a lost tool bag or tiny bits of space trash?'
the auther wanted to write aboutthe danger of debris in space that culd destroy the satilites if not checked.
Who organizes it over what things are important in space junk and the exploration of space junk.
The author organized the article by splitting sections of paragraphs up using different chapter titles. This way the article can change topics somewhat freely without looking unprofessional. It also helps the author in knowing what to talk about where.
This article is organized by facts. Some are about junk,spacecrafts themselves,and even space trash. It is very well organized by the paragraphs.
The author organizes his thoughts very uniquely in this article.  For instance, they start out with a shocking statement for a lure.  Then they move on to a definition, and such requires the history of the objects.  After such they follow suite with the dangers of microdebris out in space and just how lethal it can become.  Upon the end of that they switch to how to counter-act the problem.
He organizes it in different sections to seperate the different topics. He does this so that the reader doesn't get confused and it makes it more appealing to the reader.
He puts the stuff into a way like a person writing a paper. He puts the indtroduction, then a couple of paragrahs explaining what it is, then he gives a conclusion.
By seperating the subject changes with a headlining question.
He organizes in diffrent sections, describing each section.
They first give a brief history of the world's space exploration. In the same paragraph the author tells the reader about what space junk is and how it comes about. The author then expands on different subjects under 'Space Junk' throughout the article.
The author organizes it by first explaining what space trash and debris actually is. He does this with the heading What is Space Junk? Under this heading he talks about how space junk actually occurs, as well as a little bit of the history of space travel. Then he uses the heading Crash Course to talk about the different crashes between free-orbting satelites in the past. Then finally he uses the heading Little Bits, But a Big Deal to try to make the readers understand that even those small tiny bits of trash can seriously harm the functioning satelites and other space craft.
The author starts the artical by grabbing the reads attention with a good hook line. From the intro the author contunues onto define what space junk is to inform the reader what the rest of the paper is about. After defining what the space junk is the author then gives an examples of how space junk is made. After making sure the reader know what she is talking about the author goes into the subject of how dangorus these pieces of junk are to astronuts and space travelers. In the same paragraph the author also states the the scientifical community is serching for a solution to clean up the debries.
The author at the beginning, grabs your attention by saying shocking facts. Next, the author jumps right into factual information, such as: space junk. Then, the author discusses the harmful use of the present time. Lastly, the author talks about the future harms to come to space by talking about countries launching satelites into space, which will cause an extreme load of space junk.
The author organizes the article into sections with headings. The headings give you an idea about what you will learn in the passage below the heading.
The author divides it up into a few sections. Which I think is a pretty good idea because it grabbed my attention.
It gives specific detail about the space, and it tells you that scientist are hard pressed for an easy solution to the problem of space junk. It's giving information about the satelite problems.
They organized the articles by telling what the problem was, then go over if these things stay in space how they could harm us.
By how things happen and when they happen. this is how he does it. What is Space Junk?Crash CourseLittle Bits, But a Big DealHe does it that way so you know what the passage is going to be about and what it is going to talk about.  He also does it so you know the title of the passage and so you don't have to try to figure out what it is about . Another reason he does it so he can orginaze the story into different sections.
At first the author grabs the readers attention, then the author organizes the article by making each article more important than the last.
The author organizes the article first by giving the background information of the start of space exploration. They continue on to define satellites and how they are used. The second section describes how the satellites played a role in history. Then the author goes on in the last section to describe how the satellites are a problem now by explaining how they are involved in space pollution.
The author organizes it by putting it into four different sections each explaining a different part about space. The first section just explains that there are things in space called 'space junk'. The second section explains what  space junk is, and how it got there. The third section explains that free-orbiting things move quickly, and there is a possibility that these things can crash into each other. Lastly, the fourth section the author talks about how even such little things such as pieces of debri are a big deal to people, scientists, and the Earth.
The author organizes the article by first talking about Orbiting Junk, then What is space junk, then Crash Course, then Little Bits, But a Big Deal.  It just talks about each one indavigally by its self.
The author explains what space junk is, then explains how it is harmful, and last explains how serious this is and that we should help.
he organizes it in the years
The author catchs or attention by making a some what funny statement. Then the author tells us some history behind spae invasion, in this section they talk about what happens to the debris that comes close to the earth. In the next section they talk about crashes that have happened between satellites from different countries They tell us a little story about how an astronaut lost his tool belt in space. They explain to us how even something that little can cause a big problem.
The author breaks it down in sections. Each section talks about diffrent parts of the topic.
The author begins with an introduction that grabs the reader's attention by making a shocking statement. Instead of seeing some meteor or comet, the author sees a toolbag in space.     The author then explains what space junk is and how it got there to give us some backround information. In the Crash Course topic, the author states that not just outer space crashes create debris, but random small objects too. In Little Bits, But a Big Deal, the author elaborates on why we should be concerned. One reason we should be concerned is the space debris can crash into our working sattelites and disable them.     The author ends with an outro paragragh stating that the problem is increasing, but there are people looking for a cheap and easy way to solve the space debris problem.
The author organizes this article to get peoples attention. To try and let them know that things are dangrous and we don't see it. I feel all the author was trying to do is get his/or her point across in a way that would let everyone understand.
First the author grabs the reader's attention so that they will keep reading. The author then explains what space junk is so that the reader will know what the article is talking about. The next thing that is talked about is examples of how space junk ended up flying through space, like when the astronaut lost his grip on a tool box. The last thing he tells the reader what problems the space junk is causing and how people like NASA are trying to solve the problems.
The author starts off the article with a simple introduction that will grab the reader's attention because of the funny reference. The author slowly goes into the importance of the debris floating around in space. The next paragraph of the article starts to inform the reader just what is space junk to clear up any other myth about it.        The examples of stories and even facts about what exactly is orbiting our earth keeps the article's main purpose flowing. Their idea was to lead into the true facts that the amount of debris orbiting with the earth is a great amount. The last paragraph is meant to leave the reader thinking about what is actually going on in the space above us.
He put new headngs on it.Every time he would stairt a new secshion.
The author organizes the article into multiple sections which each have their own topic to cover. The topic of space hazards is too general to cover in one section, so many sections are needed to describe all aspects of the idea the writer is hoping to get across.
They organize by events that are in differnt sections and they use them in that order
by seadily stating facts and then completely proving his/her point at the end.
Starts off grabbing your attention and then it gives you facts about 'space junk'. Then it defines space junk for you and gives you some examples and then gives you the dangers of having space junk.
The author is very organized in this article. The author starts off the article by catching the readers interest and attention. He/she does this by using exclamation and question marks. Then, by titleing the section 'What Is Space Junk?', the  author writes about what he/she will be explaining. Next, the author gives examples of what is happening in the world and space by explaining a crash that happened between one American and one Russian communication satellite. He or she starts off the section by saying, 'In 1957, the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite.' Lastly, the author explains how dangerous space trash and space pollution is. He/she also explains, 'Yet the problem is certain to persist.'
He stated out talking about the history of the  satalites, and some insteresting facts about them. Then giving information about an actural accurance in space with two satilites. His ideas on how to stop space polution, and the dangers, and how to prevent it are need to help end the reading.
The author organizes the article in four basic tones. The first tone is the Introduction, which is used to grab the readers attention when something interesting and fun, with the help of explanation points. The second tone is the explaination of the problem, this is used to tell the reader the main reason of this article and to explain what 'space junk' is. The third tone is a brief history lesson, where the author gives real facts of satellites being destroyed by collisons. The forth and final tone is the 'Call to Action' tone, where the author brings you into the situation and convinces you to help.
He first starts with the general idea. Then he goes into more ststistics and history. Last he tells why space junk is a problem.
The author organize the article by telling what it is, how did it start.The author use date and times, he also use how difficult it is out there in space.
The way the author organizes the article is quite interesting. The author breaks this article into sections making it easyer to read and summerizing each section on the way.
The author organizes the article in sub-headdings. This way seperates information into an easy to understand way so it is easy to find certain pieces of information. Such as in the sub-headding of 'Crash Course', it talks about our satellites colliding with Russia.

We are starting to adjust to the space junk, instead of the space junk adjusting to us. We are changing for it instead of getting rid of the space junk.      I like how this article is structured. It gives detail and stories. It is informative as well as interesting. There are always problems in the world, but to know that even the smallest thing can hurt our world is good to know, as well as knowing that nothing is truly be done about it.
The first section is used to get the readers attention.  There are not many facts and it makes the subject seem lighter than it really is. The second section pulls out the facts and starts to get serious about the matter, 'in 1957, the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite.'.  The third section goes into detail about how some of the 'microdebris' came into our orbit and how easy it is to lose somthing in space.

The author starts off with getting your attention. The author then goes into detail about launching the first satellite. The author talks about how satellites collide in to eachother and produced space debris. This debris is very troublesome because spacecrafts get damaged by this debris and it becomes very dangerous. The author finishes this article by telling the reader that space trash is on the rise.
The article is orginized by history to what the problem can be and what the problem is.
The author organizes the article by first catching your attention to make you aware, then sxplaining exactly what they are talking about. Then, after describing what space junk is, they describe how it can go wrong, and after that, how it can be harmful.
He has it organised to what subject he turns to.
The author organizes the article by dividing it into detailed sections that explain the different subtitles. The whole article is about space junk, but each individual title explains different information to create organization. All of the authors thought that has to do with the crashing of space debris is under the title 'Crash Course,' all the information about the size of the debris is in the section 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.' These divisions help to make the article easier for the reader to understand.
The author organizes the article by seaperating it in different sections.
This article is organized in a way that makes sense. First, the author introduces the problem, then explains in depth what it is. Next, the author explains what is being done about the problem.
the author creates an introduction, talks about how satellites become space junk, and how it poses a problem.  With no one at the controls, diad staellites run the risk of colliding with each other.
The author organizes this articel in a speach format. Though author first states what the problem is and why it is danguros. then the author say why it is a big problem. then the author gives the call to action being that Space agencies hope to work with other corporations to find an easy solution
The author starts off with background information starting off with facts about the first artificial satellite. They then go on to tell of the dangers of space junk floating around in space. Start off paragraph six with a little story about free orbiting space junk. They end the article with telling of the dangers of microdebris. The small little things that float around can damage entire space stations.
idk this one either
The author organizes this article by using headings based on the information in the paragraphs below them. For example, under the heading titled 'What Is Space Junk' there are examples of what space junk is and how it gets there. Under the heading 'Crash Course' there are examples of how objects in space without control run the risk of colliding and causing a lot of damage to both objects, and creating more space junk. The author then closes the article with a good conclusion.
The author organizes the article by a timeline. The author starts with how countries began the great space invasions and start exploring space. Then he talks about satellites crashing into each other and other debris flowing freely in space. Then he finally talks about how dangerous the debris can be.
The author organizes the article by iportance. First the author starts out by explaining what exactly space junk is, one of the more important factors of the article. With out that the reader wouldn't really under stand the article. Next it goes on to give examples of space junk and reasons why its there. Then it lastly tells us about how small some of the particles are and why they are such a big deal.
The author organizes the article by seperating the information by order of importance and by organizing the article in a way that makes it easy to read and understand because the information is not all over the place. This is shown by the author dividing his paragraphs into sections with different titles.
He starts out at sharing how space junk is harmful.  Then he goes into talking about invastions and how they are created.  Dead satellites then have a good chance of colliding with each other.

The article contains topics, 'What Is Space Junk', 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', to organizee the article.
from year to year that people went into space
The author organizes the article according to topic. For example: in subsection What Is Space Junk?, the author explains exactly what is space junk. In the other two subsections, they are once again organized by topic. Crash Course talks about crashes of space junk and Little Bits, But a Big Deal talks about micro-debris.
The Author does a good job of stating proof after his statements, everything he says is backed up by proof. He explains to the reader what space junk is, the how it happens, and even gives examples of space junk in the world today
He starts off this artical from what he is talking about to why he is talking about it and tells whats all in space all the satalites and how in a couple of years that it will be dangerous to even go into space mainly because of all the satalites now that are out there.
The author organizes the article in a way that helps you become interested in the article and then helps lead you on to continue and read the facts and the stastistics.

The author explains what space junk is and how it got up into space, then explains what impact the space junk could have on space stations and other technology up there. Lastly, the author expresses that even the smallest things up in space can pose a threat to man-made technology up in space. No matter how small the junk may be, it can still cause damage.
He gets your a
He tells you what the article is about, then he tells you about the main topic. Then he tells you how space junk is a problem. Lastly he tells you how small things can become a big problem
The author organizes the article like this because he wants to explain what space junk is.Then how it got there and what happens when it breaks up in space. What is the causes of it in space. How we can take care of it.
The author organizes his article by putting a title over each section. He does this first by talking about the 'Orbiting Junk' and then by 'What is space Junk?' and so on and so fourth.
First, the author seperates the article into sections by using section headers.  This tecnique is usually the best for dividing up article information.

Plus the soviet union was the first to launch an artificail sattelite and the united states followed shortly after.
the author gose in order with what relly happens
the author organize this article be seperating each kind of problem by putting them in their own category. Also he discussed different type of space problems.
The author organizes the passage by an introduction into some of the common things that can be found in orbit around the planet. Then the author tells us about the history of countires sending artificial satellites, starting with telling us about when the first one was launched.     Next is the explanation of can happen when satellites in space collide. In the Febuary of 2009, two satelites, one American and one Russian, bith collided with eachother. Both of the satellites where considered disabled, and would've been much easier to remove if they were still in solid pieces. Now, they will be very hard to clean up due to the collision.     Finally, the author explains how speed can affect the force of how hard an object will hit something. In space, even tiny particles will cause some major damage.

The facts that the author gives explain how the problem came to be, and gives a brief history of space exploration. The author then moves on to describing the risk of satellites colliding into one another and gives examples of such times. He also explains how other debris is created. The article reads, 'Two communications satellites, one American and one Russion, both traveling at more than 20,000 miles per hous, crashed into each other 491 miles above the Earth.' The historical story he uses helps to prove his points. The end of the article is the persuasive part, telling why all of the facts he has shown us are significant and why space pollution is undeniably a big deal. The article reads, 'Yet the problem is certain to persist. In fact, the amount of space trash is actually increasing because commercial space travel is on the rise and more nations have undertaken space exploration.'

In, 'What Is Space Junk?', it's telling you about space junk. In, 'Crash Course', It is explaining about the colliding of the two satelites with each other. Then in the last section, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.' It is showing how that is a serious problem to the other satellites in the air.
he goes from present tense to past tense to provide an example then goes to future tense to say what could hapen if space junk gets worse.
The author first has an attention grabber to get the interest of the reader. The author then states a fact and states reason for the fact. Then the author explains about satellite crashes and free-orbiting satellites. The author then puts in the question, 'So who cares about a lost tool bag or tiny bits of space trash,' to get the author to think. Then the author ends the article by restating the problem and stating a fact about how people are trying to solve it.
It organize the article telling the readers What Is Space Junk, Crash Course, and Little Bits, But a Big Deal. Its letting readers know whats going on in outterspace. Most people believe that outterspace may not be as dangerous but the narrator is trying to persuade the readers outterspace is more dangerous than being on earth.
The author organizes the article in a simple, yet structured way.

The author organizes the article by explaining what space junk is and what it can do to Earth and surrounding satellites. Then, the autho goes on to explain about why space junk is going to increase.
he puts it in groups or in indevidual sections like 'what is space junk'
It gives me brief information about the article.  Startng the article off with some hurmor 'Grab your telescope!  Look up in the sky!  It's a comet!  It's a meteor!  It's a tool bag?'     Then goes into the begining about how the 'Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite.  The United States followed suit, and thus began the human race's great space invasion.'  It goes on about what happens when tools float off into space by itself, and how it could be really dangerous.       The conclusion, just states that hopefully in the future, scientist can come up with a solution about how to solve the space pollution problem.
The author uses subtitles to tell the readers what the following infermation will be about. The author has a funny or interesting subtitle for each section of information.

he rconizeses it but writing biout space junk
The author organized this article by first grabbing the readers attention. Then he breifly explained the meaning of the article by telling the readers what 'space junk' is. He then went on to explain how space junk is a problem.
The author organizes it so that: 1.the basic information is first introduced; 2. the knowledge of how the satellites get up there and what could happen to them is given; 3. the reader knows what could happen between two or more malfunctioned satellites; and 4. the reader knows what harm the debris of two crashed satellites could do.
he organizes this article by breaking it down into things of importance. by first explaining what space junk is, then how important it is and how much it can effect us. then by breaking it down to the sizes of the space junk.
The auther organize the artical by putting a title for each parograph with all the right information to make it easyer for the readed to understand. also the parograph is orgainized by the dates and what happend.
The author organizes it in a proper manner. It was mostley in order and never of the topic or the paragraph.
he give goods examples and then he uses alot of facts to back up what he was talking about. he also uses alot of information about past accendets that happend in space cause of debris.
The author organizes this article in a very intelligent way.  First he uses a rhetorical question to start the introduction.  Then he uses sub headings for the next paragraphs.  The first one is called 'What is Space Junk?' This paragraph defines Space Junk and explains how it is formed. The next paragraph is called 'Crash Course.'  This paragraph presents an example of a collision of space junk and how it is dangerous.  The last paragraph is title 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.'  In this paragraph, the author is explaining that even though most of space junk is relativley small, it can still be dangerous at high speeds.

The author states what space junk is, then how the space junks occurs, lastly finishes off with how much effect the space junk can cause.  The author says that many things have been shifted off beyonds earth's atmosphere. Then the author says that when satellites become useless they become dead and will crash with another dead satillite which will cause some mess. The auther also says that the little mess can cause some much damage for beinging so small.
He organizes it by diffrenet tips of things that happen in space or about the spacecraft

The author organizes the article so that it is easy to follow and understandable.  Someone who doesn't know anything about space exploration can easily know what the author is talking about and what message the author is addressing because of the organization.       The author first draws the reader in with the introduction and addresses the problem.  He then explains what space junk is.  The next section explains how space junk occurs, and the article concludes with how big of a problem the small bits of microdebris can cause.
he put different sections in it and caught the readers attention in the begining.
According to the article, the author organizes the article by putting catchy phrases to attract the reader to read into more of the passage. Then after a catchy introduction, the author talks about what space junk is and how it is harmful to our satellites and how the debris affects Earth.
It started off with one thing then went to the next. It told us how bad space junk was. This was when the Soviet first put a satellite in space. The crash course told about the satellite. The satellite ran the risk of colliding into each other. The little bits, but a big deal told us what was important and what was not. It showed us the serious problem. Told us about the tiny fragments traveling thre space.
The author organizes the article by putting it in headings.  He has headings such as What Is Space Junk?, Crash Course, and Little Bits, But a Big Deal.

He has a new tittle for everything he is about to talk about.
The author organizes the article with a hook that interest the reader with bold statements, states the main point with background information on satellites history and strong conclusion warning the reader about the dangers of the 'increasing' amount of space junk and suggests a solution to the problem.
Well, first he starts what an attention grabbing introducting. Immediately following he gets serious about his topic and explains just exactly what 'space junk' is. He then proceeds to explain how satetites crashing at hish speeds creates all sort of space junk. Lastly, he expresses his concern for the growing problem and staes that NASA is looking for a solution.
The auther tells us how important the space stuff is used.
The author organizes this article in a text book form.  With sections having titles, What is sapce junk, and then having information under the section titles. It has facts backing up they're statements.
The article is organized in a chronological way. The 'lifespan' of debris, so to say. The author talks about how satellites are freely moving about the earths orbit, and will soon enough crash into one another. This creates hundreds of microsatellites, otherwise known as debris. These debris are flying over 20,000 miles per hour, and present a serious risk for anything that comes into contact with it's path of travel. The author then concludes with a sort of 'look to the future' with commercial space programs, which will only worsen the space pollution issue.
First, the author describes what space junk is then gives you a short history of space explorations. Second, we learn about the satellites themselves and about what eventually happens to them. The authour tells us about satellites colliding in space once they 'die' and when they hit each other pieces of space junk come off. Besides satellites the author gives us another example of a tool bag from an astronaut who was doing repairs on the ISS. Finally, we are told about how just the smallest pieces of space junk can be dangerous.           'If you find that hard to believe, compare grains                         of sand blown by a gentle breeze to those shot          from a snadblaster to strip paint from a concrete          wall.'This gives us an example of something on Earth to compare to the debris in space.
The author organizes the article by starting out the introduction with something that grabs the readers attention. By then identifying the flying object in the sky as 'a...tool bag,' it makes the reader want to read the article. The author goes on by explaining what the meaning of 'space junk' is and how it gets there followed by what happen to satellites when they 'die.' The author finishes his/her article by notifying the reader that space junk is a big deal and is 'increasing because commercial space travel is on the rise and more nations  have undertaken  space exploration.'
The author organizes the article by using bold headings to catch readers attention.
The author first catches your attention with the introduction. The author then explains how space junk is formed and next why it poses a problem in space. The last passage explains the seriousness of the space junk in order to drive the point home.
The author organizes this article by importance. First he grabs the attention of the reader and then leads into background detail about space junk. The author then provides a paragraph that explains the dangers of satellites. Lastly, the author ties it all up and explains that there are many people who care about a serious problem.
There are many bold faces titles in the artical to show which each one is about.
He put it in year order. he put a title above each section.
After the introduction, the author starts by describing what this 'Space Junk' is by talking from when the first satellite was launched to the supposedly hundreds of little junk satellites scattered around orbit. 'Crash Course' explains a story about a crash in space that left debris in space and that these accidents can happen at any time in space. The last part talks about how this debris is dangerous despite its size.
The Author oraganizes this artices very well. He starts out by telling us what space junk really is and how it works.Next, He would tell us about microsatellites and how they are used. At last, he talked about tiny bits of space trash. So over all he did really well oragnizing this article.
The article is organized in a flowing manner. It starts by giving a point, goes through the body by describing what the narrator means by it, and ends in a call to action.
The author organizes the article by first stateing what space junk is then gentally flows in to how it is a potentailly dangerous hazard for other space explorations and how this matter needs to be taken seriously.
When people think of space they don't think about all the junk that is in it. when we look up into space we dont see all the junk that is in it either, but what we don't see is a problem. When they try to tell us that there is junk in space most people don't believe it and all the stuff falls down to Earth, nut most of it don't. I think it's sad that there is a mess in space a place that should be untouched.
They tell us that we should look though a telescope and look thought it. There is 33442 satellite the size of a baseball anything goes smaller. This makes it difficult for spacecraft to steer clear of microdebris fields.
The author organizes the article from information of the past of space junk to information of the present and how dangerous it can be. For example, it starts off in the first part stating, 'Over the past 52 years... Earth's atmosphere.' This shows the variety and past of spacecraft. The next part helps to better explain how dangerous satellites may become because of the risk they have of running into one another. This part leads into the present. Then, finally it shows that how serious space debris is by statating, 'Those bits of space debris present a very serious problem.' The way the article is wrote is to show the effects of space activity.
The author organizes the article very well. The author starts with getting your attention he then gives background information on space. Next, the author tells how the debris in space becomes uncontrolled. Finally, the author says how small the debris can be and that this is a big problem.
The author first starts out with shocking statements to get the readers attention. Then, the author gets serious with facts about how space exploration has cluttered space. After that, the author describes how satellites 'die' and crash into each other, creating microdebris. Next, the author goes to explain the how little pieces of debris, known as microdebris, can be just as harmful as big pieces of debris. And finally, the author proposes answers to the problem of cluttered space.
The author organizes the article first with a light, engaging introduction followed by background information, further explanation of risk, and conclusive descriptions of the problems and what is being done about them.
The author organizes the article in chronological order, starting with the introduction and background information, followed by the current problem, and then how the problem will most likely persist in the future.
The author organizes the articals by headings.
The author uses subtitles to make to article different from others.
He begins by telling us what 'Space Junk' is and then tells us why it is harmful and what harm it can cause. In the end he tells us how scientist are working on a way to fix the 'Space Junk' problem.
At first the author gives a great explanation on what he or she is going to talk about. He or she starts to explain that space junk is bad for the globe. Then the author starts to explain what the space junk is. It is the human race's great space invasion of the Soviet Union and the United States satellites that have been launched in space. The next set of information explains the crash course of the satellites. If the satellites come near eash other then they will crash into each other and then our country would not be able to have that control anymore. The next information the author talks about is the tiny bits of space trash, or also called space junk, that is in space floating around.
He organizes it by what is more important to them and they go from there.
The author starts with 'What is space junk', which tells of space missions and how we 'invaded' space. Then it tells of satellites and how they can crash, then of microdebris.
He puts it together by telling one problem after another.
He puts it into interesting paragraphs and also puts it into interesting caterogies.
The author organizes this article in an easy to understand and well planned way. The author has chosen to set it up by and seperate the paragraphs by sections, not just spacing and indenting. The author started with background information, then transitioned into information about how free floating satellites, and then concluded with statistics and information from NASA and other space agencies about how space exploration should be done in a more organized and clean way.
The authoe organizes this article in a series so titled paragraphs. The fact that each section of paragraphs tells you what thoes will be talking about. It gives you a little clue as to what you will be reading.
He puts the article into sections, he is not just jumping around form subject to subject, he gives a title and the article or the section follows it below the title.
The author organized it by getting your attention at the beginning by 'Grab your telescope! Look up in the sky! It's a comet! It's a meteor! It's a...tool bag?' Then the author told the reader about space junk and the risk it causes like dead satellites at the risk of colliding with each other.  Then the author lets the reader know that space junk is a big deal and people do care about it.
In different paragraphs about different things.
The author put the article under three main topics after the introduction. Under each topic he describes that topic with a lot of useful information.
The author splits the article into groups of two to four paragraphs. The author wants to make it easier to write the article and to help the audience find specific topics in the article.

I think that the article would be confusing as a reader if there were no divisions and sections in this article.
He organizes it so you better understand the issue.  If space junk and little bits, no big deal were switched you would have no idea what was being said.
The author organizes the article by putting titles or what is going to be talked about above the paragraph. One example is, 'Little Bits, But a Bid Deal.' The author talks about how much people really care about the lost tool bags or the tiny bits of space trash.
By good details.
The author organizes the article by using a catchy way to bring in the attention of the reader. Lines 1-4 illistrate this. Then the author begins to use facts and statistics to show how serious this topic was. This was the authors main goal it seemed, to show the reader 'space junk' is a serious matter.
The author organizes this article he starts with the intoduction telling what it is about and then he gives a background on space junk and early space explorations. The writer then proceeds to tell about how space juk becomes space junk and then goes on to tell why it is harmful and dangerous and why we should worry about it.
The author organizes the article by using subheadings to seperate the different main ideas that he has. In each of the subheadings the author gives a different idea and gives additional information that will give support to the idea. It gives the reader different categories that related information will fall under.
The author organizes the article by informing us of the dangers of space junk.  The author gives us details the hazards.  They briefly inform us of the history and provide us with a real-life example.  The author states, 'the amount of space trash is actually increasing because commercial space travel is on the rise' (paragraph 11).  This proves how dangerous space junk is.
He organizes it by what happened to the satellite during the colision, what was going on before it happened, and what will happen now after the colision.
The author breaks down the information in to multiple sections. It says what each section is about and sets the tone.
How he organize the article was really good. He did it like that to catch our attention, and how he worded it.

he went by what happend first
The Author Organizes the Articles by first saying what a space junk is. The united states followed suit and thats when the human race begun. The objects themselves, however are positioned hundreds of miles above earth.The second thing he talks about is cash course where dead stellites run the risk of coliding with eacht other like in february 2009.

And finally thewriter tells us how the little objects floating around there now are a big deal and the more that the satellites break the more debry their will be in the future that section is title 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.'
He organized this article by putting the facts of satellite in order, and telling the reader about each section which is talkin about the satellites.
he starts with  a attention getter then goes to statistics and facts. then he states the problem. He talks about a solution. Then he said that these little things are a big problem. he also said that the solution is difficalt to find.
The author of 'Orbiting Junk' organizes the article by opening with an introduction, following with background information, supporting information, and ending with a conclusion.
The author organizes this article into four main parts 'Orbiting Junk', 'What Is Space Junk?', 'Crash Course', 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.'
The author organizes the article by first explaining what space junk is, then explanes the crash course of the satellites and debris, after that it explains they are little bits, but a big deal. The author uses all of them combined to explain the importance of space debris and there effect on space travel.
The author organizes this article into smaller subtopics which explain different aspects of space junk.  Each subtopic, such as 'Orbiting Junk' and 'Crash Course,' highlights an individaul aspect of the problems caused by space junk while supporting the authors statement that space junk is a serious problem.
He or she starts out with how the space race started, an how countries started sending satellites one afte another. Like with Soviet Union an the United States. the goes with how when the satillites die the may run into anothe satellite. An that may cause tons of debris. And how its harmful to Earth an space.
The author organizes the article by catching the reader's attention in the introduction. Then the author does a history of space junk, then the next paragraph the author talks about crashing satellites. The eight paragraph talks about little pieces of space junk and how they can be dangerous and in the last paragraph the author states that the problem is increasing and the worries of space agencies.
The author of 'Orbiting Junk' organizes the text in a cause and effect manner. The author begins with the beginning of the space race, which began to cause debris to be left in outer space.  He then procceds to other ways to create space junk, such as colliding satalites.  He then demonstrates the problem posed by the orbiting garbage, which causes individuals to begin searching for a solution.  Since most of the authors major topics are caused by the one before, the author arranged his or her piece in a cause and effect pattern.
The author organizes the articles in a way that will make it easiest for us to understand. First he introduces us into what the whole piece will be about and gives us the main idea. Then he explains what makes the 'Space Junk.' Next he gives an example of how the problem becomes more serious. Finally he gives a lot of facts that describe how big of a deal this really is.
The author begins the article with a kidding tone.  The introduction is not nearly as serious as the rest of the sections.  'What Is Space Junk', 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' are all have a much more serious tone.  'What is Space Junk' gives a background of space exprlorations and explains what space junk is.  It also foreshadows the potential problems of space junk by asking 'What happens when a satellite 'dies' or malfunctions.'  'Crash Course describes how space junk came to be and different situations it involves.  Such as colliding satellites.  'Little Bits, But a Big Deal describes other bad situations of space junk and the very serious problems they can cuase.  Problems like 'disastrous holes'.
The author starts off with something interesting to get the readers attention. Then he expalined the reason for his opening statement, after that he told us what space junk a little background history and simpla facts about it. then he closes with why it matters. why they little tiny space debris or junk matter. because it is harmful.
They organize it by making up sections. For example, 'What is Space Junk' and 'Crash Course.' Having sections makes it easier to find the information you're looking for.
The author starts out by joking about space junk. After that the author gives facts about what happens to object in space and how it effects us. And lastly the author explains how important it is and how it needs to change.
The author organized the article in a pattern the pattern they used was weaker reasons to more effective reasons through out the article and the use of transitions to put an emphasis on the importance of certian topics.
I believe that the author did a good job of organizing this article. An example of good orginaziton is that he dosn't get side tract. They used good headings like What is Space Junk?, Crash Course, and Little Bits, But a Big Deal.
They talk about certain things and make them relate with other things when they need to. Everything is in perfect place and nothing is run together.
The author organizes the article by writing about different topics in a section. For example, in the article Little Bits, But a Big Deal, the author talks about how even the smallest fragments in space can be dangerous. The author organizes this article very well and it's easier to understand.

First, it starts off how every good essay starts off. With a good hook, to bring readers into it. Next comes the beginning statement, the sentence that tells the audiance what the writer is writing about and where they stand. After that, you have the body, which, in this case, is made up of the history of space travel, the information of how much and what makes up the debris, and finally, the impact it has on our space explorers. After these statements, comes the closure of the article, giving all of the well rounded information that it is steadily increasing.
The author organizes this article by having a strong, attention-grabbing introduction and three main topics that support his opinion on the harm of space junk orbiting Earth. His conclusion paragraph states that there is an awareness of need for a solution to the three suggested issues, but no solutions have been drawn by any nation thus far.
The author organizes in a way that tells us what space junk is. From there the author clearly explains what happens with that junk and then goes on to tell us how harmful it can be for future exploration when we cannot prevent tiny bits of debris from damaging the space craft.
First the author introduces the topic in a light heearted fashion. Then, as the article progresses, the author talks about past events that are crutial to know in order to under stand what 'space junk,' is. After that, the author tells the reader more about satellites, and how serious the debris orbitting in space is. THe author starts off less serious, and finishes on a very serious note.
The author starts with an attention getter. Next the author explains the main topic and what exactly space junk is. Further more the author segways into the risks of dead satelites which he finished speaking about at the end of the first section. Lastly, the final section is about how space debris is dangerous and how it's a topic that many care about and it's not a small matter.
The author makes subtitles that lets the reader know what the paragraph is about.
The author organizes it from big space junk to small space junk, from satilleite to micro junk.
It starts off with a funny take on a realistic situation which goes into an article about space junk. The article then goes on to tell about what space junk is and how it has been accumulating. It tells of crashes between two satellites and how the debris of the satellites can cause a lot of damage to spacecrafts.

The author organized the article by geological events.
By understanding what countries put satelittes up above our earths atmosphere causing one to malfunction making the other do the same by them colliding.
The author goes from telling what space junk is then to satilites crashing and finally to little debris in space that can harm you
The author does a good job of organizing information in this article. The opening paragraph grabs your attention then we get more of a background on how serious space junk is. The author tells us how it is formed and how dangerous it is. At the end of the article the author tells us that these small pieces of junk pose a big threat.
HE ORGANIZES IT BE SECTIONS
The author organize the article in the yaer it happen the way
The author organizws the articles by how he explains them. Each article is explained in great detail.

The author organizes the article by seperating the problems into their own section of the article.  The titles are in order how the debris happen.
The author organizes this article by grouping together similar topics and titling them in order of describing space junk to the solution of space junk. It starts with 'What Is Space Junk?' and ends with 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'.
The author organizes the article by heading each section with a title, for example, What Is Space Junk?, Crash Course, and Little Bits, But a Big Deal. Then in each section the author gives details about the topic of the section given away in the titles. This makes understanding the information easier.
The author organize the article by put the less importan to the most importan and then he puts the most importan like how many miles per hour and what had happened in the past year.
The author organizes the article by using the classic topical structure. There is the introduction, followed by the three subtitles: 'What Is Space Junk?', 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'. The author then supports the subtopics by details put in two to four paragraphs.
The author puts all the main points as his title. in the article it says what is space junk, then it has all of the information about space junk underneath it.

The author tells us how satellites and get into space and how they dont work anymore. Then  what happens
The author gives you details like over the past 52 years a variety of spacecrafts have been sent beyond Earth's atmosphere. Not all of the satellites can still work because of all the junk that is foalting around. Most of the satellites have actually had problems and came back to earth.
This article is separated into sections or chapters, each new chapter has a title. The entire chapter sticks to the point. This article is organized as if it was a book.
He organizes it by sections, by 3 different parts. One is, 'What is space junk', 'Crash Crouse', And 'Little bits, But a big deal'.
Intro. Beginning. Middle. End. First by using shocking statements to grab your attention. Then once the reader has your attention he/she provides you which researched information and the hard facts. After providing the facts he/she explains the various problems space junk can create. Lastly he/she leaves you with a few things to think about.
The author of this article organizes it in a very intelligent way.  First the author begins with an introduction that captures the attention of the reader. Other than the beginning title the author also includes subtitles or headings. The author uses three different headings to divide the different pieces of information into the same categories. The subtitles are organized in a way that helps grow on the seriousness of 'space junk.' this can simply be seen through the subtitles themselves; What is Space Junk, Crash Course, and Little Bits, But a Big Deal.
The article is organized under different headings and the headings are explained.  Also, the years of different facts go in chronological order.
The author starts out with surprising statements to alarm the reader and to make them attentive. The author also has the titles of each section titled appropriately and accuratly to help us understand the seriousness of trash in space. We take space for granted most of the time and we have no idea of the dangers of the junk up there that can actually do harm to earth itself.
The author organizes the article by starting off with the question' 'What Is Space Junk?' In the two paragraphs the author explains about history of going into space. Then there is another title, 'Crash Course'. Those two paragraphs explain satellites crashing into each other. Then there is another titled' 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.' Those three paragraphs explain the floating lost things in space.
The author organized the article, 'Orbiting Junk' by adding different sections of reading.  In saying sections, I am referring to the titles through out the article.  'What Is Space Junk?''Crash Course' 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'Those titles are all examples of how the author organized his article.
The author organizes this article in a simple, yet effective way. They have chosen one main point, which is space junk, and created a few subtopics. By doing this, they have made it simple to stay on topic and still learn about different aspects of the problem.     The article begins by telling the audience what problem they are going to elaborate on, which is orbiting junk. Next, they answer the question that many of us may be asking ourselves. What is space junk? Well, after reading the second paragraph, we know what that is. After this, we are educated on risks of crashes and collisions with the junk that is orbiting in our solar system. Last of all, we read that no matter how small the object is, it can have a large impact on other objects in the atmosphere.      Because these smaller topics are separated from each other, the reader can maintain their attention while reading of the many different factors of space junk.
The author writes this article so that the term 'space junk' is explained in the beginning.  The process of the object becoming a space junk is explained in the beginning followed by the dangers that occur because of it.  This article is organized so that the reader is informed about space debris little by little.  After being informed on how the 'dead' object can cause harm, the reader then learns about why space pollution is becoming a major problem.       The way this article is organized helps the readers be informed on space pollution without recieving too many information at once.  The article is divided into sections then paragraphs, allowing the reader to understand more easily the information that is being given to them.
He organizes the article by titling things in sections like, 'What is Space Junk' and only talks about what is needed in that section and 'Crash Course' is another way the author broke up the article.
He oragnizes the article by catching the reader's attetion before explaining the serious issues of space junk. He then explains what space junk is so we understand what he is talking about later on the article better. After he explains what space junk is he talks about the history of us invading space and how stuff gets left behind. Then he explains how space junk is a serious matter to earth and the people heading to space.
The author starts out explaining what space junk is and how it got up in space. Then they talk about the dangers of it being in space and the impact of the space junk collisions 'both satellites traveling at more than 20,000 mph, crashed into each other 491 miles above the earth'. Then they go into why this is all a big deal to us and the world.
He organizes through chronilogical order.
The author organized the article with different headings and sections.
the author starts out as if it's going to be a good story. Then the author goes into how dangrous the 'orbiting junk' can be. Under ' What is Space Junk' they tell you 'over the past 52 years, a variety of spacecrafts' have been launched into space. In ' Crash Course' the author tells you ' with no controls, dead satellites ru n the riskk of colliding with eachother' Last but not least in ' Little Bits, But a Big Deal' the author tells you that 'scientists are hard-pressed for an easy solution to the problem of space junk'
The auther puts the article together in different sections. First, there is the hook and intro. Then, there is some background info and then the statistics and current matters on this subject.
He organizes it on how much the reader will learn, and how much the reader will read and comprend. He doesn't want his reader getting bored after the first paragraph.
The author organizes the article by talking about a certain subject, but then hinting to another subject. This hint gives the reader a sense of knowing what is coming up. For instance, in the introduction she mentions space junk, but then she moves into another paragraph explaining what it is. At the end of that paragraph she mentions it 'circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit'. This led into the 'Crash Course' paragraph and so on.
It is organized by how it happens in chronological order. The satellites would have to crash before they would have junk fall off of them.
In this selection the author organizes his/her main points into sections that relate and flow from one to the other. For example, he/she use the transition form the main title 'Orbiting Junk,' to 'What is Space Junk.' These sections describe what 'space junk' is. Then he/she transition into the dangfers of 'space junck,' by using titles such as 'Crash Course,' which transitions into 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.' these sections demenstrate the dangers of colliding sattilites. The author organized his/her selection in a way that flows from one point to the next.
The author begins the article with an attention grabber, in order to make the reader interested in the topic.  Giving the reader a little information regarding space junk, the author clarifies the topic and gives details in the second section, 'What Is Space Junk?'.  Describing the main topic to the reader gives the author an opportunity to discuss the problems with this increasing volume of junk.  The author ends the passage by describing the dangers of these pieces of debris, stating that the objects in space are similar to '...[sand] shot from a sandblaster...'  The author concludes his passage with a tone of resolution; he hopes that solutions can be created to stop this growing problem.
They talk about the defintion of space junk that is in our outer space. They give an example about when the Soviet Union launched the first satellite inter outerspace.     Then in goes on and talks about the crash course which is when the dead satellites run the risk of colliding with other objects floating in space. The problem is it can only see about the size of a baseball and their are smaller things floating around in space that can crash into the satelite. That hurts the satalite because the objects are going at least five miles in space. The space shuttle isn't moving that fast and is very delicate.      The amount of space trash is increasing because the commercial space travel is up because more nations have taken space explorations. They are hopiong to come up with a solution to stop this pollution in space.
The author divides each different part about orbiting junk into their own sections. The author doesn't fuse his or work together.
The author first draws the readers in by using an attention grabber. Then the author gives the reader some history about space. Then he processes on telling the reader about the harmful risks that are accurring  in space.
First the author started talking about the basic information about the space junk and then he wrote what it is use for and also talked abour all rhe dangerous and safety thins about the space junk.
The author organizes the article in catagories as to help the reader understand the article better. The article starts out with definition 'What Is Space Junk?', goes to how some space junk is created 'Crash Course', and then goes to why space debris is a big deal in 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'.
The author organizes this article by true facts. He first talks about the history and how satellites first started out in space. Then he goes into if the collide what would happen and how it would be harmful to space. He lets you know how some of the satellites travel, how fast they move per second. He lets you know that when they do collide harmful things can come from it. He organized it so that after you something benefitial he urges that something bad can also come from something good.
The author organizes the article by having headings for different topics.  This makes it easier for the reader to follow and stay on topic.  The author begins the article with a common phrase 'It's a bird!  It's a plane!  It's Superman!'  but with a unique spin.  The author then presents a heading 'What Is Space Junk' to show that the fun, friendly introduction is complete and the serious article is begninning.  From there, the author uses a new heading (ie..Crash Course, Little Bits, But a Big Deal) to show when he is about to begin a new topic.
He starts out with a more general topic then he gets into more specific topics like space junk then he goes on to say crash course and gives a example how a american space craft and a russian craft carshed. Then the auther talks about the debris in the orbit around the earth.
The author orgaizes the article in different sections by explaining the different aspects of space junk such as the categories of orbiting junk, what is space junk?, crash course, and little bits, but a big deal.
The author of this article organizes it into four different sections. The author introduces a problem, gives the history of this problem, tells you how it occurs, the finally tells you why it matters.
The author organizes this article into the past, the current, and our future lives. The author organizes this article in a way that the atomosphere seems crucial to our planet.
The author organizes the artice in a simple way. The author grabs the attention of the reader first. The author does this by a comical statement. Then the author goes into how serious of a problem it is right when he grabbed your attention. He gives you simple facts from history and just flat out tells you things so that you don't have to read between the lines. He tells you the basics and then sums it up by saying how important and dangerous space trash is and leaves you to think with that.
The author begins by giving backround information explaining how common space junk is formed, then leads into how tiny bits of space junk are formed, and finally how these small debris are a big problem.
The author organizes the article by putting it in order of what is space junk, to why it effects us. In the article it mostly states all of the problems people have had going into space.Their problem all talk about getting hit or crashing into something floating in space.
The author started off by telling us what space junk is, then went into the different catergories. 'What is Space Junk', is the title for the first couple of paragraphs.
The interduction gets your attion to read the artical and tells you what its going to be about. What is Space Junk gives more information on the objects in our atmosphere and what they are doing there. Crash Course tells a story about how some space junk gets in the atmospher. And the last paragraph tell how all this is really a big deal and something should be done about it.
They break it into sections, which allows the reading to get a better understaning. For example, in the introduction 'Grab your telescope!' allows the reader to jump on bord in a sence. In the What Is Space Junk? section 'In 1957, the Soviet Union lunched the first artificial satellite.' This give the reader facts and ideas of what is going on. In Crash Course, 'With no one at the controls, dead satellites run the risk of colliding wih each other.' This shows risks and what could happen. Little Bits, But a Big Deal 'Those bits of space debris present a very serious problem.' Shows why we should be worried.
The aticle goes from attention getting to informational. Then it is jus importance of space junk.
The author orginizes the article by putting things together. For example, 'Crash Course' has information about satellies and other things that crash into other things. They put like information together so its easier to go through and find things.
It starts with an introduction, then it gives subheadings with facts about the subheading.
The author organizes the artical into groups. He explans all of the groops: What is Space Junk?, Crash Course, and Little Bits, But a Big Deal. e explanse what will happen or what could happen in space if something runs into each other or if an astronaut droped something wile working.
He organizes it by making the introduction telling you that space junk might just fall on you. Then he tells you what space junk is basically. After that he tells you how they collide and form into microdebris and how they might crash onto earth. Little Bits, But a Big Deal shows you that some people might not really care about those tiny forms of debris, but you actually should if they go at a very fast speed.
he organizes the article from history to crashes tothe problems that concern micro debris. and what is being done to stop it.
By telling facts about satellites. In 1957, the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite.
The author first starts out with the introduction which explains what it is about. The next paragraph is 'What is Space Junk' which is telling us what space junk is which is the cause for all the debri and junk in space. The next paragraph is called 'Crash Course' which tells us what the space junk has caused in space.  The last section is 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal and it tells how people feel about the junk and what is going to happen to it all.
The author organizes this artical of how these project help the Earth but can also harm the Earth.
Like the way he starts it of gets you in it then he start to describe them in sections and certain parts to make the article good and didn't stick on one sublect but speard it out and also had facts in the article some of the things they do when they are in space and the oblects they use
From talking about what is space junk. Then the author talks about the most serious concepts of what space junk can do to spacecrafts in orbit.
The author organizes the article with specific titles for each section.  For instance, one of the titles is called, 'Crash Course.'  This section of the article explains how satelites and other debris floating in space can potentially collide and screw up satelites with will affect global communication.
The author organizes this article by beginning with an introduction, leading into 3 main paragraphs, and ending with a conclusion.
He breaks the topics into differnt sections. So they can be read, and understood more clearly.
by informitive paragraphs
He organizes it by detail.
The author starts with a great attention getter that is a concerning statement. Then he goes into the history of when the human race first did something with space. The russians launch a satellite. Then the auther goes into how debris can get into the orbit by telling us that satellites do crash into eachother. Then he goes into how these little peices of deebris are a big deal because they can be caught and pulled down to the earth at enormous speeds.
By putting them in order and using titles of his story to catch yur eye and make u want to read how inportant it is
The author organizes this article by putting headings at the top of the page and keeps adding new ones when he changes subjects. It lets you know the good about space junk and the bad about space junk. Then it goes into the sizes of stuff how even the little pice of sand is a big deal and could really hurt your space craft.
the author organizes the article into sections that explain what it is, what is couses, and how we are affected. each section is wsell informed and organized. such as the two satellites colliding in the section titled (Crash Course).
The author organizes the article with an introduction, and three body paragraphs.      Paragraph one gives a brief history of the 'great space invasion', and poses the question of what happens to the damaged satellites, telescopes, and space capsules that cannot be repaired.     Paragraph two begins with what may happen if two unmanned satellites were to collide in space, resulting in hundreds of 'microsatellites'.     Finally, paragraph three expresses the seriousness of the matter, stating that at extreme speeds, small objects can create huge wholes and damgae other space equpiment. A solution is difficult, but engineers have compensated by adding protecting to objects in space. It also emphasizes the growing number of satellites, capsules, telescopes etc. being sent into space, and how therefore space trash is increasing.
This author organizes the article first with an introduction to grab the reader's attention. The introduction introduces us to what the rest of the paper is going to be about. The author then is able to explain exactly what the paper is about with 'What Is Space Junk?' He then gives us an example of what is going on with the problem and then why it is important and what is being done to help it.
The author starts out the article with an introduction the will grab the readers attention and make them keep reading. He also catorgorises each section with a title like; 'what is space junk','crash course', and 'little bits, but big deal' to let the reader know what each paragraph is about. the author insures the reader by using true information instead of his or hers own openions.
The author organizes the article by, first grabbing the readers attention, then describing what space junk really is, then how space junk is formed, and lastly why we should care about it, and what we can do to reduce space junk.
The author used organized paragraphs
The author organizes the article into groups.
The author organizes the articles by splitting them up into different sections, and they all have different titles on what the paragraph is about.
The author orgnize the article by putting everything in its own section of the article. for example in the first paragraph the author puts a part about space junk. then in the second paragraph he talks about what space junk is and how it comes to be. At the end of the article he says how space junk is becoming a really big problem for everyone. That is how he organizes the article.
They organize it into subject matter: 'What IS space junk?','Crash Cource', and 'Little Bits, Bit a Big Deal.' They also try to catch the readers attention with the titles of the sections.
The author organizes this article in a interesting format. For example, he introduces us with dialouge between two people. Then he changes his tone into a serious matter and explains what he is going to talk about.      Also, he divides his paragraphs into topics so we know what the next paragraph is about. This shows that he is very organized and wants to keep us organized as well while we are reading it.
The author organizes the article about aspects of space exploration in a specific way. The author first gives the reader an attention grabber in the introduction. Then, the author informs the reader about a brief history about space exploration and space 'junk'. From there, the author talks about satellites and how space junk can be harmful to the surface of the earth.
The author organizes the story by first explaining where and when the space junk first started and where it came frm. Then the story later explains how these little problems can became a very serious matter.
grab your telescope! look up in the sky! its a comet!its a meteor!
The author put this articke in different collums and explains what each of the headings mean.
He starts off by giving information on the history of satellites then goes into detail on how satellites can collide with eachother. That is when he then explains why space trash is bad.
In this article, the author does a great job at organizing all of his information. I think that it was good that the author had a main title and an introduction that explained all that he or she was going to talk about, and then the author had subtitles when they were going on a new topic. I know that when the questions came up, it was very easy for me to find the answers because the subtitles organized it very well.
The author shows good organizational skills with the way he or she wrote the article. He or she started out with suspence then went into some history. Then ended with a warning about the dangers of space junk.
The first part of the artice he uses the word space junk. Then in paragrphs 4 and 5 he explains what it is and how they circle the earth in there own orbit. In paragraphs 6 and 7he talks about what happens if two of the satelites collide together then it forms tiny peice of material that cant be seen from earth. Also in the last paragraph he tells how the tiny peices of debris still plays a big part in space.
The author organizes the artical into one over all topic which is the introduction, and three sub topics.  I agree that 'space junk' could become a big problem.  I feel this way because the qoute, 'If you find that hard to believe, compare grains of sand blown by a gentle breeze to those shot from a sandblaster to strip paint from a concrete wall.'  That qoute shows that even small subtances can cause a lot of harm if it has enough force, and something falling back to earth from space would have a ton of force.
The author organizes the article by giving information about space junk, then talking about dead satellites and there risk of colliding with each other.  The ending talks about how these small peices of spacejunk are actually a dangerous problem.  There are even titles to go along with the clasifications including: What is Space Junk?, Crash Course, and Little Bits, But a Big Deal.
The author organize the article in a way that allows the reader to easily comprehend what the paragraph is describing by telling what each topic pertaines to.It also allow the reader to go back and review a certian section quickly.
The author organizes the article into four major groups; the introduction, 'What is Space Junk?', 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'.
the author starts back in the day when space came to the attentions of the u.s. and the u.s.s.r. and how over the years things have progressed and how we have left jusk in outer space that could mean a threat to us at some point.
The author organizes his articles by bolding the new topic paragraphs. He makes it stick out and be readable for the reader to catch the eye or attention of the reader, and it informs the reader that he is switching topics within the story.
The author organizes this article by putting it into four main sections.  The first section is just the opening that catches one's attention.  The second section is explaining what the space just is.  Without this section, one may be confused as to what the author is talking about.  The third section is about times when objects in space have collided and made lots of debris that is still floating around today.  Finally, the last section is talking about how even though there are just tiny bits of debris, it is still very dangerous.  This is a very good way for the author to present their information.
The article is in catagories of what happens.
The auother organizes this article by first wexplaing what space junk is, thengiving examples of how its a proble, then how its such a big deal.
They organize thisw artical by putting main headings and under heading the talk about the subject that the heading is referring to. Then they chosse many diffrent topics and do the same thing for alll the other topics and the write about the topic.

He put the important pats first.
The author organize the article he says in the frist article What is space junk in 1957 the soviet union launhed the frist artificial satellite the author organize the article evey well
The author starts with 'Orbiting Junk' and 'What Is Space Junk' to describe exactly what space junk is and what it is caused by. The author then follows with 'Crash Course' and uses this section to explain what the problems are that space junk can cause. Finally, the author ends with 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' and describes what can be done to prevent the problems that space junk causes and what space centers are doing to help the cause.
The author organizes the article into multiple sections divided by headings.  The author does this to help the reader get a better understanding about what he/she is learning about.  First, you learn about the history of space travel.  Then, you are given information on a real collision that occured a couple of years ago.  Following this, the information is then put into perspective by talking about a sandblaster.  Finally, the call to action takes place to conclude this article.
The author organizes the article by first explaining the origins of the microdebris that litters the solar system, then going into explaining the harmful problem that this debris is creating for the Earth's surface.
The author organizes this article into diffrent categories. In the categorie called 'What is Space Junk?' it goes to describe the diffrent types of debris and how they become lost on our atmosphere. In the article called 'Crash Course' it describes two satelite crashes that happened in 2009 and 2008.
It is organized in different sections to make it easier to understand.
The author organized this article very well.  After introducing the piece, he went straight to informing/educating his readers about how space junk came to exist.  He then moves on to tell the readers about how satellites can be great contributors to space junk, followed by the importance of awarness and concerns of space junk.  He informs his readers how the various pieces of junk can be harmful to machinery that scientists send into space, but alo how the damage from the collisions of space junk to said machines is unavoidable.  The author then ties up the peice with how space agencies are hoping to work with other coroporations and even nations to come up with a solution to the 'space pollution'.
The author seperates it into sections, and in eaach section he/she puts some very interesting facts in there for the reader.
He first draws in the readers attention, then informs them of what space junk is. Third he informs them of how space junk is caused. Fourth he informs the reader of how even the space junk pieces may be small they can also be very dangerous.
He starts out with a introduction. Next he defines what the problem is. After that he tells the reader why its a problem. The last paragraph is his conclusion and why it needs to be stopped.
The author organizes the article by first giving a story in the introduction along with a paragraph about orbital pathways and space junk. Then, he or she explains what space junk really is in the next paragraph. The ending paragraph in that section, talking about dead satellites circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit, leads to the next main point, Crash Course. That talks about the American and Russian satellites crashing and leaving debris all over its newly created orbital path. Also, it says that accidents do happen, and gives an example on an astronaut loosing grip of a tool bag while doing repairs on the International Space Station. This leads into Little Bits, But a Big Deal. In this paragraph, it says so who cares about a lost tool bag or tiny bits of space trash? This leads into the subject that many people do, infact, care. It then proceeds to talk about that and then ends the article with the conclusion.
The author organized this article in a very neat way, by dividing the categories up into iindividual sections. It is very easy to read. It's rather refreshing.
The author describes how space junk is prodused and what causes it to become small bits of space junk. The artical starts with satellites and works his way down to what microdebris is made of.
He get information and tells it how it is bad and dangers to the world and in space.
He organize his article in the way he is talking about what is Space Junk? in one seccion, crash course in other seccion, and Little Bits, but a Big Deal in other seccion so we can understand better because everything is not together.
The author talks about different space topics. Ever part of the artcle have it's own topic an whats it's about. Like the different parts of the article.
This article is organized with a fairly common format. First is a small, shocking anecdote, which serves to grab the attention of the reader. Then are a few sections highlighting the necessary details the reader needs to know to fully understand the problem such as an explanation of how space junk comes to be and how space junk is so dangerous. These are followed by a conclusion paragraph highlighting the most important information to help the message sink in one last time.

Next, the author wants to tell you about the history of sattelites and other objects we have sent in to space and how they are still orbiting this earth. This lets the reader know there is a ton of waste in our atmosphere. Crash Course and Little Bits, But a Big Deal tell us how dangerous all of these large and small bits are to astronauts and sattelites. At the end of the last paragraph the author concludes that scientists are trying to find a way to clear or avoid these bits of matter. Therefore, that is how the author organizes this article.
The author organizes this article by having headings.  The heading 'What Is Space Junk' lets you know this passage will be about space junk and what it is.  Each heading helps the reader know exactly what they will be reading about. This is a good way of keeping an article organized.
The author first starts out by explaining how space junk got there and the growing knowledge we have of space and its history. Then he explains how and why satellites are colliding with eachother. In every paragraph there is a different explanation of the effects of space junk and debris.

good not to bad
What the author is saying is that when we send up a satellite eventully they will brake and they wont get fixed so we send another one up their and some times they will crash into one another and that is how we get space trash.
He puts all the most important information at the beginning.
It provides a question and then provides information.
He first starts with an attention getter. Then he explains to the reader what space junk is, when is started and how. He uses an example of space junk by talking about serious collisons with unsed satellites. He then describes how fast things are really going in space by using sand as an example.
He begins with a simple introduction which catches the readers attention. Then he to a serious point where the author starts explaining about Space junk. Once he gets to his point he starts explaining on how useful satillites become space junk over time. On how it becomes space junk and dont get taken out and stay there orbitting the earth and end up crashing with each other and become more of a problem.

they oraganize this artical by what happends for time to time
The author organized this article by using subtitles like 'What Is Space Junk?' First, the author grabed the attention of the reader than began to make the article.
They organize the story by date and years, the past events and events that happen now
The author organizes the article in chronological order.      He or she stated that in 1957 the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite. In paragraph 6, they stated that in February 2009, two satellites collided into each other. Finally, in 2008, they wrote about how a tool bag escaped from the International Space Station (ISS).
The author organizes this article by an attention grabber, then, telling us what space junk is, netx, telling us about the collision of satellites in space, then, lastly, the author explains the dangers of space junk in space. No matter how small the space junk is, it is dangerous.
The author tell us what happens in space and how space agenices work to keep satellites from crashing to each other.
To begin with, the author organizes the article in which he gets the readers attention by saying 'Grab your telescope! Look up at the sky! Its a comet! It's a meteor!' Next, the author tells the reader all of the background information about the space junk. In this section it says 'In 1957 the soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite.'  Then the article tells about the crash course. Finally, it tells about how the little pieces in space are a big deal when they are moving fast. These small pieces can cause damage, because of the rate of speed that they are moving.
The author opens this article atracting the reader then the author gives us facts about why sapce junk is a serious matter and its increasing so we should work together to make a solution.
The author organizes this article in sections. The first paragraph, the introduction, introduces the topic of the article. The second section, 'What Is Space Junk?', provides an explanation of what the topic is exactly. The third section, 'Crash Course', shows how the problem began. The forth section, 'Little BIts, But a Big Deal', shows how important the topic really is in regard to the pollution of the Earth.
The Author organizes the article into three sections. He talks about three very important probles in space. One section talks about and describes what is space junk. For example, it talks about satellites in space and staying there becoming junk. The next section talks about space junk crashing into space objects causing harm to space ships. The last section talks about a little objects in space can be a big deal.
First theres an introduction and that gets you to want to read and figure out what the purpose of the story is. Then it explains what space junk is and gives history of how it has been made and some history about satellites. After that it gives and example of a time in which an occurance has happened when two satellites collided. Then the story goes on about what precautions and how dangerous it is when they launch space missions or satellites. I thought it was a good way to organize it all.
The author does a very good job of doing the article. He tells it step by step so people know what he is saying.
The author organizes this article by putting a hook first 'Grab your telescope! Look up in the sky! It's a comet! It's a meteor!'  Then he proceeds to tell a breif hisory. Than he moves to talking about the actual topic of space junk.

The introduction serves to catch the reader's attention, 'What is Space Junk' informs the reader about what exactly space junk is, and the final two sections inform us of the author's opinions on space junk.
the aurthor organize the article by putting the information about when we start to first put satillites into space and then starts talking about other things about the satillites and ends it with they hope that the space agencies will come together and clear up space junk.
in Cadigories.
He seperates different tpoics into different paragraphs. In each paragraph he describes the topic and gives examples.
The author organizes the article by breaking it up into smaller bits of information that all have to do with one another subject wise. The sections in the article are arranged in a way that is easy to understand, and gives information so you understand the next article.

In sections to support the authors ideas.
he organize it by putting it in a order where you would understand it better.
The author organizes the article by providing an example of space junk, why it is occuring, and just how dangerous space junk can be. In the first section, the writer tells about the tool bag, and how orbitals for stalites are cluttered. In the second and third sections, the writer is explaining what space junk is, and how it occurs. In the last section, the writer talk about the problems space junk is posing, and how it is more important than people think. This organization is effective, because the reader wants to continue reading for explanations and examples.
The arthor gives many details why space junk is not good at all. Some people don't care when others do. The author also puts the details in sections and all the information that they are talking about all in one paragraph and they don't skip around. They tell us that some people take it seriously and some people don't play around with things like space junk.
The author puts the information into categories.
he he is careful on how he describes the way space jumk is made.
The author starts on a somewhat fast pace, trying to grab the reader's attention. It starts with how space junk got there and where it all came from and what they put in space. Then it goes to 'Crash Course', which tells about how all them satellites and other space debris collide at speeds that are very fast. And finally, 'Little Bits' which is about how the little debris can do a lot of damage to orbiting satellites.

aneye catching first line thats works its way into the article while using some unique words to catch your eye
The author starts off by telling us what space junk is. Which is debrie from satelittes and tools. Then he tells us how space junk is created. He tells us about the collission of two satellites and about and astronaut dropping a tool box. Next the author says that even the smallest bits of the space junk is harmfull and can do serious damage. Finally the author comes up with ways to prevent space junk from harming space crafts.
The author oraganized this article with three different titles that are important about space and what people put out there.
The author uses different titles and descriptions for each of the paragraphs that are used. He describes many of the passages by showing what can happen. For example in 'Crash Course' he tells about how satellites can come to collide with each other and cause serious damage and make more space debris. Also in the passage 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' the author shows what can happen to an object whenever it gets hit by debris by noting what a sandblaster can do to a concrete wall.
The auther organizes this pasage vary well in my retrospect. the way he or she is trying to orginize the fallowing artical, is into littel sections of diffrent paraphrase to help the reader orginize the diffrent information in there head. So it makes it well writin.
The article was about how a orbiting junk. they talked about tool bag.Space junk is currently of great
the author organizes this article with the facts first then alll the supporting details then what hes trying to get across witch would be the space junk can be very harmfull to anyone or anything travling through space.
The author breaks the article into three parts which are, What is Space Junk?, Crash Course, and Little Bits, But a Big Deal. The author does this so he can get the point of each section across in an easier way to understand.
The author begins with an introduction intended to catch the reader's attention.  He then explores the topic in more detail, using three different sections.  The first one, entitled 'What is Space Junk?' explains how space junk comes to orbit the earth.  The next section, 'Crash Course,' describes what happens when multiple pieces of space junk collide.  Finally, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal,' explains why space junk is a problem  and why it is important to find a solution.
The author organizes the article by breaking down the main points into sessions instead of just reading it with no explanation. It starts off with a problem, the problem is explained, the problem happens, then finally it says how the problem can be taken care of.       The introduction is riveting and makes makes people want to read more of the article. It holds attention by starting off with seeing something up in the sky.      The next two paragraphs explian what space junk is. It tells what is happening in space and how many problems arrived in space. They raise the awarness of what is happening in space and how it could be a problem in the future.      The section titled Crash Cousrse tells us the problem. It says how it is not safe and how an accident happend in space with all the debris flying around.       Finally, the last section tells us how we can care. Clean-up is possible. But, it is still dangerous in space. Many fragments float around that cannot be detected. It also says that space agencies are working together to make space debris free.     The article is organized chronoligically. They state, a problem, and throughout the paragraph, they say what happens and how efforts are being amde to make it better.
The author gets us thinking about space and the things that go on. Then gives us the history about the space exploration and the dangers there are in space. The author tells us about all the space junk especially that can be seriously dangerous. All the information lead up to the fact that there is a lot of junk floating around in space thats dangerous and that the satellites could collide because it has happened before.
He orders the passge by what space junk is, how it gets there, and the problem it is causing.
This article is based on the organization of things in space such as bad things, good things, and historical things. This article has information about trash in space, collision of satellites, and junk throughout space.
He puts the article in different sections to organize the main points in each section. For example, space junk can be anything released into space.
It starts off with startling statements to pull the reader in then goes over a brief history about space junk, then explains how dead satellites run the risk of colliding with each other and then talks about the importance of space junk in the paragraph 'Little bits, but a big deal.'
'What Is Space Junk?' is kind of like an introduction to the seriousness of the passage. it tells us some starter facts and other things.     'Crash Course' explains a couple starter facts that introduce us to 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'.     'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' kind of wraps up the entire passage and explains into more detail, what space junk really is and the dangers of it.  It explains that it's not going, like, five miles and hour, but THOUSANDS!
The author organized the article by stating the problem.  Then telling what they are. Gives information about how serious this situation is.
The author divides the article into 3 sections and an introduction.   Each section has a main focus, but is still an idea within the main topic of space debris.  The introduction is used to draw the reader in with odd statements that one does not usually here.  Then in the first section the author introduces the topic of space debris and gives a brief explaination.  The following section explains collisions involving space debris.  The last section explains the severity of space debris and sumarizes the article.
The author organizes the article by putting the information into catagories. They give a brief summary in the introduction, and go straight into the first section; 'What is Space Junk?'

They give examples about this topic.     And finally, they end the article with the 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' section. This talks about the seriousness of space junk.     So overall, the author chooses to organize the article by sorting the information into subjects, based on the different topics of space junk. This makes the article very easy to read and to understand.

He puts each peice that goes togather in the same paragraph and is good about it by not leaving antything out.
Tolf reder somr happen.
The author organizes the article into four different sections. The author first starts the article with an introduction paragraph about space junk that foreshadows what the rest of the article contains. Then the article has a section that gives background infromation about how space junk came to life. The next section gives actual examples of what can happen when random space junk is orbiting the Earth. Finally, the last section tells the reader how dangerous space junk can be at high speeds and how this space pollution is still affecting space travel today.
The author does not mix around his information. In one paragraph he is telling you about things up in space. In another paragraph he may be saying something like how satelittes are controled so there are no crashes.
He organizes the articles by importance.
He puts what matters first like what is space junk and then goes on too things that happen in the 1900's and how space junk in polluting.
They first start off with somthing to get your atecntion then they inform you about what space junk it.

As the article goes on, it discusses how dangerous collisons from these debries are, too.
The author organizes this article by having rhetorical questions to get the reader's attention and then he gets serious and tells some historical facts about the space debris. After he states that he tells more about the satellites and other machines in space used for world communication.
He begins with an Introduction and then goes on the describe what space junk is, then talks about a crashing of satellites, and then finally why such small pieces are such a big deal.
The article is organized by giving definition, asking questions, and giving examples. An example is 'What is Space Junk?', and it tells definition and how it effects astronauts.
At first the author let's us know what they will be talking about. After that they tell us, and give examples of what 'Space Junk' is. Then they argue there point on how dangerous and harmful it is.
The author starts out in the introduction by really getting you ready for what is to come. In the fourth to fifth paragraph she explains what the space junk is and what it means for us. In the Crash Course section she talks about satellites and how they have failed to work before and how that affects things.

The author organizes his article by using different sections that each describe different aspects of space junk. The first section describes what space junk is, and what happens to it. The second section describes how some of the trash is generated, through dead satellite collisions or small things like a lost tool bag. The last section describes why space debris can cause serious problems for spacecraft and reseach stations. The debris can be undecectable by military radar and travel at such speeds to the point of being highly dangerous.
In this article, the author has organized it in a unique way. The author has used the providing information to contrast the harmful dangers of space junk. The article is seperated in different categories where that topic is explained. The author tries to emphasize the importance of the outcome we will have if people ignore this situation. With no one to control the dead satellites, they run with great risks of 'colliding with each other.' This can cause a harmful effect and is what happened in February 2009. This impact caused hundreds of pieces of debris, each assuming its own orbital path.
The author organizes this article by putting similar information together and leading up to the conclusion. He starts with the introduction by introducing 'space junk'. Then, he provides the audience with information about what space junk is. The author then gives the audience information on how effective crashes can be in space. He finishes off by telling the audience how these small things in space can make a huge impact.
The author follows the introduction with background information on the history of space exploration and introduces the urge of different countries to begin researching space. The author than transitions from speaking about satellites that begin orbiting, into the dangers involving collisions between objects in space. To add credibility, a actual account is stated that relates how serious this problem of space junk can be. Finally, the importance of safety is again stressed and it is said that the problem has not yet been solved.
The author organizes the problem by starting at the beggining when we first started exploring space. Then the author goes in order from there and tells us how so much debri gets into the orbit around earth. Then the author tells us how dangerous it is and how we can detect it but there is nothing we can do about it.
The author organizes this article in a smart, and strategic way. At the beginning he catches the reader's eye by making an exctining sentence, and it goes like this; 'Grab your telescope! Look up in the sky! It's a comet! It's a...' and so forth. That is exciting on my part, and made me want to read this.      After the exctining part, the author got serious about his article, and started to state the dangers about 'Space Junk'.
The auther organizes this article by order of importance. The auther tells about launching space crafts, then moves into the importance of space junk and how space junk creates crash courses.
The author organizes the artical with a title and subheadings. He uses three subheadings to organize it.
He organizes it with history, then more current events.What Is Space Junk?, Crash Course, Little Bits, But a Big Deal
The author organizes the article in order of importance. He first introduces the idea of space junk posing a problem, describes how it has occurred, and closes with startling information about how space pollution is a very large threat to space exploration.
He organizes it by putting sections and paragraphs in it. also by naming everything.
The author organizest the article very well. The author uses the introduction to get the point across. He then does a good job in explaining what space junk really is and how it is increasing as we are now doing more and more space research. This is followed by the section Crash Course which explains how space junk causes collisions in orbit. The next section emphasizes the damage this space junk can cause to space crafts and other research satellites. The ending is also very well thought out restatign the problem and showing how it is an increasing problem. I liked this article and thought it was very well organized by the author.
The author organizes the article by addressing a brief history of space travel and a brief description of what exactly space junk is. Then it gives us some examples of what caused some space junk to accumulate and make microdebris fields. Lastly, they address what they have tried to do to reduce the amount of space junk that is orbitting our planet.
The author organizes this article by using different sections. The article uses the section 'What Is Space Juck?', 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.' The cause for this is to have everything more organized.
Her organizes the story by using pargraphs that contain a specific topic. These pargraphs have titles above to give you and idea of the point about to be made.
The author organizes the article as orbiting junk, explains what space junk is, the crash course, and why little bits are a big deal.
They organize it by the data. In 'What Is Spave Junk' they stick to just describing certain things and then when they wanted to go to a new subject they went into 'Crash Course.' They kept all of the same ideas together instead of running them all together.
The author organizes this article in sequential order.  The article starts by telling you what 'space junk' is.  Then, the author tells you what affects it has on satellites.  Finally, the author explains how the debris is small and it makes it hard for astronauts to see it.This article is in sequential order because it shows the sequence in which the events happen.
He organizes the article from most dangerous to the solutions or what we are working on to be our solutions.
The author starts the article with a fun attention getter, and then swtiches to a more serious organized fashion of writing. It is split into 4 detailed topics that explain space junk.
The author organizes this piece very well do to the fact that everything is titled and is in there own little section.  For example when they talk about the debres crashing into things they placed that in the crash course section of the piece.
In the article 'Orbiting Junk', the author arranges the artcile in a logical sense - He starts out with the introduction, which uses rhetorical questions and well known phrases to grab your attention. He then moves on to inform you of the main problem of 'space junk' with his primary thesis. The next section the author writes is 'What Is Space Junk?', and this section has one major goal - to inform us readers with the definition of space junk. In addition, the author provides use with facts that show the length of time space 'junk' can exist in orbit. 'The objects themselves, however, are positioned hundreds of miles above Earth, far from elements that would cause them to degrade or burn up'. The next section is Crash Course - this section shows how space junk gets into the atmosphere, through the examples of American/Russian satellites colliding with each other, or an astronaut accidently releasing a tool bag. The next section 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', focuses on the hard hitting truth - that space debris can cause severe damage to space shuttles and astronauts. The author shows how undetectable pieces of debris, also known as microdebris, can cause sigfnifigant damage through the comparison to the sand particles used in a sandblaster. The author closes his article with his conclusion - that space trash is increasing in volumn and size because of commerical space travel and how we need to undertake a solution to space pollution.
The author seperates the article into a build up/introduction, and then different potential issues that can arise from space junk.  The introduction goes along with 'What Is Space Junk?'(Build up). And the other sections are issues arisin due to space junk.
The author organizes the article by splitting up the diffrent sections of the diffrent serious matters. There's the space junk, and the reasons for it being there, and how unnecessary it is.
The author organize the article in sections with headers. The headers tell us what the sections are about.
The author organizes the article by first grabbing the reader's attention with the sentence 'Grab your telescope!  Look up in the sky!  It's a comet!  It's a meteor!  It's a...tool bag?'.  This passage is interesting and makes the reader want to read more.  Then the reader is told that this can actually happen and that this article is going to be about space junk.  Next the reader learns what makes up space junk and why it is there.  The article explains how the space junk is the stuff that doesn't fall back to earth, so it isn't burned up in the atmosphere.  Instead it floats around in space.  The article also explains how satellites can also be considered space junk.  In the next section, crash course, we are told why satellites can be considered space junk and what happens when they collide.  We also learn how easy it is for space junk to get into space.  But by now the reader is wondering why this matters and what problems could come from these little bits of debris.  The author brings us to the answer with the section little bits, but a big deal.  This section explains why it is important and why such small pieces of debris can cause such big problems.  A useful metaphor of sand and sandblasters is used here to put this problem into a perspective that can be understood easier by the general public.  Lastly, the article explains what is being done about this problem.  So, in a more general form we are hooked into the story, then given a problem, then the problem is explained in more detail, then we are told why it's a problem, and lastly what solutions are out there and what is being done to solve this problem.  This method of organization ensures that the reader is never confused, and is given the information in a logical order, answering the reader's questions directly as they come.
The author starts this article in a playful mood and then gets serious.  They start of with comments and then start withthe facts.  In the beginning the author says, 'Grab you telescope! Look up in the sky! It's a meteor!'  Then they go on to list facts like, ' In 1957, the Soviet Union launched the first artificial stellite.'

Then, he talks a little bit about space junk and the harmful effects of it.  Then he lets the readers know that objects in space travel a very high speeds and dont have to be very big to pose a problem.
First he uses short anektot to get readers attantion, then he uses historical information , so that it would be easyer for reader to understand the problem. Afterwards he is using some modern facts to put more emphesis on the problem. Then he conludes the artical by stating that problem won't be solved if people won't get involved.
The author organizes this article by separating the information into different sections, each focusing on one aspect of the main subject, with each individual section leading into the next. In the first section, for example, the main idea is introduced through a creative opening that grabs the reader's attention and provokes interest in the topic. The next section then offers a more elaborate explanation of the topic of the article and a short history of how the problem of 'space junk' began. The author then goes on to explain what happens to the debris and how collisions occur. The last section then explains why the collisions are a problem, despite the small size of the debris. In this way, the information from each section builds upon what was presented in the preceding section, but each has its own specific topic. As this is an informational article, it is arranged in a logical order to provide the best understanding of the facts.
The author organizes the article by starting out by grabbing the readers attention, then tells historical fact and how it effects this article, and finally the author tells other important facts related to the situation of 'Space Junk'.
The author starts out with a little background story of the 'great space race' and how the effects when it comes into Earth atmosphere. In Crash Course, the author gives a story of what happen in February 2009 between two dead satellites and introing the paragraph into the next paragraph.In Little Bits, but a Big Deal, explain the affects of sapce juck. Once the tiny fragments hits any spacecraft or satillites, they could cause serious damage like and affect space obervations in the future.
He organizes this article by first talking about what space junk is. During that paragraph he talks about satellites and what happens when they die or malfunction. He then tells people about the satellites and what happens to them. Then he goes into what space trash and space junk is.
He makes you interested in the story right away. Then he gives a lot of statistcs and facts.
Such an observation isn't as strange as it seems. Orbital pathways around our planet that were once clear are now cluttered with the remains of numerous space exploration and satellite missions. This space junk is currently of great concern to governmet space agencies around the globe.
Some people lke stuff about like about space than other people do because commercial space travelis on the rise and more nations have undertaken space explortion
The author organizes the article by talking about the least important things to the most important things. He first talks about Space Junk which is not all that important except that it does effect space. Then he talks about crashes that have happened and the importance of what happened. Finaly, he then talks about space microdebris which realy affects the space which could destroy astronauts spaceships whenever they go up to space.
The author's organization of the article by starting off with an interesting beginning and slowly went to the main point. That is a sign of a great author.
In Orbiting Junk, the author organizes the passage into many sections. The author has a intro then explains what space junk is and its effects on the earth.
This article is very well organized. In the introduction the author hooks us with interesting statements, then following that he organizes the information he is trying to tell us into little sections. These include; What Is Space Junk, Crash Course, and Little Bits, But a Big Deal. By doing this he can clearly seperate his ideas, and also by reading the titles we can get an idea about what information we might find in those sections. One specific example is under the section titled 'What Is Space Junk' the author answers just that question. Also, if someone is looking for specific information, due to the way this article is organized it would be more easy to locate.I think this was a very smart move in making a not-so-interesting topic, at least for me personally, relatable and easy to read.

The author jumps right into the topic by explaining the great space war between the Soviet Union and the United States. This was a time period when multiple space explorations took place and shows examples of space junk. The author also describes the many variations of technology we send into space. As quoted in the paragraph, ' space capsules, telescopes, and satellites.' These are variations of future space junk and the author breaks it down into how space junk is made, where it comes from, and the dangerous repercussions it may cause.

'What is Space Junk?' is use to explain the space exploration history, and to show how many sattelites are being sent into space. 'Crash Course' shows some examples of space crashes, and how these crashes are not far and few between. Finally, 'Little Bits, But Big Deal' shows how scientists are trying to figure up a solution to the space junk problem.
By explaining what is space junk and describing how it got out in space and is still out there. Then talks about crash couses that has happened out in space and the materials is still out there. Finally talks about all the little pieces and how space ships have the hardest time driving through space avoiding all the garbage floating around.
In the first section called orbiting junk he introducess us to space junk and gets us interested in his article.  After that he breifly explains the space age in what is space junk.  Then he talks about the dangers of sending objects into space because they can run into each other in crash course.

In the second section of this article, the author goes on to further explain the problem and how the problem is caused. The author begins with the first time a satellite was sent into space and how the satellite may eventually become another piece of space junk by malfunctioning.     In the third section titled 'Crash Course', the author explains how the problem is progressively becoming worse.  He says that if two of these malfunctioning satellites collide with each other, they would create hundreds of pieces of debris.     In the fourth and final section of the article, the author states that many people are concerned about this problem and how it will affect us.  Spaceships could be seriously damaged by these pieces of microdebris that is undetectable by our current technology.
The author organizes the article by firstly creating a good 'hook' to get the reader interested in the rest of his/her article.  From here the author explains the beginnings of space exploration and how space junk has been emerging as a growing problem since then (Paragraph 5).

Then he gives a short introduction saying his story will be about the rising issue of 'space junk.' From this he begins explaining exactly what space junk is and when it first appeared in the atmosphere above space. After that he gives a past event from February 2009 and in 2008 as examples of how space junk occurs. Next he describes the severity of these space crashes by using details such as comparing 'grains of sand blown by a gentle breeze to those shot from a sandblaster to strip paint from a concrete wall.'  This comparison was used very well because it helps create an image of how bad it is when two satelites in space collide. Finally the author closes his article by telling the reader how big of a problem space junk is becoming and how space agencies are beginning to work together to put a stop to it.
The author starts off with telling us what space junk is. Then he tells us about history and how two satellites crashed into each other.And last but not least he tells us about microdebris.          Who cares about space dust?No one controls dead satellites. Disabled objects in space becomes pieces of high-tech junk.
The authors tone is a big attention grabber at the beginning. As the story goes on, the details increase and get deeper.
The author tells whoever is reading this actual stories of what has happened, and dangers of space junk.
The author started with an opening paragraph explaining what the article is going to be discussing.  The author then gives an explanation for what he or she is writing about.  The author then writes about how it is harmful to space and our environment.  The author ends the article giving his or hers opinion about what the artivle is discussing.
They put what things are in space and what they do for space matters. then they told what they do to help out and what is all the danger stuff. they put little bit of informattion about space and equitmit they use up there. they put things that are made to be up there and things that are not sopse to be. they put them all in there own catagorie so people can find out simple facts about them very easy without haveing to look around for the information.
He organizes it into different storys with different titles.
I believe is in chronological order according to years. In the very section after the introduction, it says in 1957. After that it gradually progresses to present day. The author also would explain the major problems in the past, and work his way up to explaining our modern day problems. For example, the author talked about 'Space Junk' in 1957, and later in the article about satellites crashing into one another in 2009.
The author uses many different sections that split up all that he has to say.  If he didn't conduct the article this way then he would have trouble trying to meld all of his writing together such as the part about Orbiting Junk and Crash Course.  The two of them would not go together very well without the seperation of the sections.
That there is too much junk up in space and the more and more they get is just going to make everything go wrong and soon everything will start to crash.
The author puts the story in different sections. For example one section is 'What is Space Junk?' and the next section is 'Crash Course'.
At first the author brings you in with starting sentence. After that he explains how serious space junk really is, then goes on and tells about the space invansion between the countries.     But the last and maybe most important thing, is the microdebris fields, the military can not detect anything smaller then a baseball. While people may thing a baseball is small, and can still hurt our spacecrafts and put our sattelites in danger.
The author starts out with an introduction paragraph that was written in a way to grab the reader's attention and get them to keep reading. It's written in an almost comical way by using a phrase that many people have heard before, which is the first sentence in reference to the famous 'Superman' line. Then it goes on to paragraph to that is used to explain to the reader just what the rest of the article is going to be about and give a little background information on it. It gives facts about how satellites were started and how space junk is formed. Then it moves on to explain the dangers of this space junk in paragraph 6-7 titled,'Crash Course.' It explains that anything left up in space can become a danger for other satellites. The risks and dangers are further explained in, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.' This part explains how even though something can be so small and may be thought of as not a very big deal, it can still cause a lot of damage. It gives the sand example that says that something going at very high speeds can still cause a lot of damage. It concludes by saying that there are ways to prevent space junk by countries working together to come up with a soluting to this problem.
The author first defines what satelittes and space crafts are and why they are launched into space, then explains how the microdebri effect them. The author backs it up with detail and specific information and findings.
The organize them in a way that grabs the authors attention each time about each subjest of space junk.It is in order by the least dangerous to the most dangerous thing just by the last title Little Bits, But a Big Deal.
The author first starts off by telling what the problem is. The problem is space junk. The author explains exactly what this 'junk' is. The author then gives a history of space exploration. I think that is important because it shows that after 50 years there could be a lot of junk built up. The important thing is they realize its a problem; that is explained in the last section. They're trying to find ways to solve this problem.
The author organizes the article by telling what space junk is first. By doing that you know what it is and how it got up there in the first place. After that they tell you about the crash course. In that it tells you how and why the space junk crashes into one another. Then after they tell you about that, they tell you how unsafe little bits are. Within that it tells you how even the smallest thing can cause a big problem out in space.
The author organizes this article by title names for each topic in the article, to break down each topic so it is easier to read.
He organizes it into paragraphs with headings of different topics. Like What Is Space Junk? This paragraph talks about the history of when it started with launching satellites into space. Crash Course. This paragraph talks about how satellites haved crash in space. Little Bits, But a Big Deal. This talks about how little thing that get lost in space like tools from astronauts get lost in space and which can cause a lot of damage.
The author starts his article with a joke, then it turns to serious. The author moves to the dates to satellite crashes and other dates of space. On the last section the author talks about how space junk is dangerous and why we need to stop sending excess substances into outerspace.
He organizes it in different catogories suck as what space junk is, what happens when stuff crashes and how it affects and how tose peices may be small but they can still affect in a huge way.
The author begins the article with strange sentences to gain the attention of the reader.  Then the author begins inform the reader of the dangers of debris in space, first by giving a brief history of space exploration.  The article is then divided into sections which talk about different types of debris such as satellites, and small bits of space trash.  In each section the author describes the danger of each.  The article ends by the author describing efforts being made by NASA and the European Space Agency to maintain catalouges of space debris and to help reduce space debris.
people think that space is junk and noone like this earth
The author organizes the imformation in this text in a chronological order. The author goes from telling about the history of the Great Invasion, to the present and how the debri from even way back then, could be effecting astronauts and satelittes of today.
Scitentists are hard -pressed for an easy soulution to the problem of space junk.And both National Aeronautics and space Agency(NASA).
From the least dangerous, to the most dangerous things of space junk.
he puts everything in order like you should and he puts the smaller paragraphs toward the beginning of this article.
The author organizes this article by beginning with a attention getter such as, 'Grab your telescope! Look up in the sky! It's a comet! It's a meteor!' Then moves onto explaining in the first part of the body what exactly Space Junk is and how it can affect us. An example would be,'what happens when a satellite 'dies' or malfuunctions and can't be repaired?' Of course the answer to that it's disbaled and becomes a piece of high-tech junk, circling the globe in uncontrolled orbit. The second part of the body it is described that if a satellite is malfunctioning it has the risk of colliding with another satellite. From paragraph six it explains that two communication satellites one American and one Russian, both traveling more than 20,000 mph. crashed into each other 491 mi. above the Earth. The main purpose of the next and final part of this author's article is tiny bits of space debris and how it can be a serious problem. Tiny fragments traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the most carefully designed spacecrafts. Here is an example form paragraph nine that supports this statement, 'If you find that hard to believe, compare grains of sand blown by a gentle breeze to those shot from a sandblaster to strip paint from a concrete wall.' All in all the author explains in paragraph eleven that the problem still persists and that the amount of space trash is increasing because of commercial space travel is rising.
The article is a well organized piece. It starts out with grabbing the attention of the reader and then presents the problem that 'space junk' is a serious matter that needs to be brought to more people's attention. It then goes in to defining what 'space junk' is, as well as the 'great space invasion.' In the third section, it gives examples of how it is harmful to our planet and what really goes on when we send satellites in to outer space. Finally in the last section, it states that they are again a serious problem and reitterates everything that the article is about. It also presents a solution.
The author starts out the article with excitement and makes the reader more interested in this passage.  He organized it by starting out with what was seen in the sky that you don't see everyday.  He's got different titles which talk about what exactly is in the sky on this earth that we don't normally see such as space junk and what it is.  He then goes into talk about how the space junk causes crashes and the harm that it has.  Then he goes into talking about how even if it's little particles that aren't very big, can still cause serious damage due to the the speed of the spacecraft and what it runs into.
The author basically organize it from the timeline of special events. It started off with fun facts then it talked about alot of facts.
The author organizes the article in sections of information. Each paragraph is describing itself.
The author organizes the article by first providing an exciting introduction about space junk, then follows it by explaining what space junk is, is the section titled 'What Is Space Junk?'. After that, the author tells of a specific event in February 2009 that gives the reader of an event that actually happened, not of one that could or might happen. After that section which was called 'Crash Course', the author goes onto the next section, which was named 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'. This section tells the reader, in detail, or how dangerous space junk can be. It also explains that NASA and the European Space Agency are trying to come up and with an easy solution. After that, the author finishes up, but without a specific conclusion.
He puts it all so that he ceches you with a hook. then he tell you some history. then he goes right into the importance of the articol and tells you about space junke.
The first thing that the author does is tell you about the first satelite launched into space. Then over the years more satelites were launched, the author is telling you the causes of the space debri. Next the author talks about the dangers when satelites collide with other things. The last thing that the author talks about is how dangerous a tiny piece of debri could be. The author explains that even tiny grains of sand could be very dangerous. During the last paragraph the author tells the reader that the problem is never ending and ways that corporations could come together to help this problem.

The author organizes this article by putting headings on each subject to tell you what it is going to be about. The headings are also in a bigger font and bolded.
The author organize the article by introducing firstwhat space junk is. It tells thats space junk is space trash
The author organizes the article by starting off with a very clear introduction that captures the reader's attention. In the body of the article the author explains what space junk is, how it got into space, and why the junk stays in space. Then the author gives an account of what happened when two satellites crashed into each other and produces hundreds of smaller satellites. After that the reader is informed of how dangerous microfragments of space junk really are and how different space agencies, such as NASA, are dealing with the issue. In the article's conclusion, the author shares with the reader that the amount of space trash is increasing rapidly and that space agencies hope to work alongside nations and corporations to stop space pollution.
The author starts off telling you what space junk is. Space junk is the unused or broken satellites in space and other smaller things. Then, the author tells you about dead satellites running the risk of colliding with each other. Dead satellites colliding has happened before. Lastly, the author talks about how little bits of satellite pieces are a big deal. Smaller satellite pieces go faster and therefor can crash into other satellites and destroy them very easily. She organizes her article by order of importance.
The author organizes the article in some what of a chart. Telling what space junk is, and then the course that it is on, and last but not least what little bits, but big deals. Like what would happen if this little piece of space junk came flying at us and then tore a huge hole in the side of our space craft.
In this article the author origanizes it by indroducing an important topic with something catchy, that will pull the reader in. His sentence that states 'Look up in the sky! It's a comet! It's a meteor! It's a..... tool bag.' introduces the paragraph well by catching the readers attention with a phrase that you have heard before only with different word.

He aslo compares it to things that make it easy to relate to; However he sticks to getting the point across.
He breaks it down into different topics. The first main section,titled 'What is Space Junk?', is about the cluttered solar system because of satellite debris. 'Crash Course' is about satellites crashing into each other and the debris that it can cause. 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' is about how tiny bits of debris may seem harmless but they can still do damage.
by placing examples of the things that have been lost at space and what they some timew do like two bad satalites crashing into each other,  then going to what needs to happen
The author first states his opinion and the reasons behind it. Then they give the reader some details ad facts to back up his observation. They gave examples of past experiences involving cluttered space. The rest of the article is information and examples surrounding the problem.

Then  'Crash Course', tells the reader about the risk of colliding satellites with eachother. Then the reader goes to  'Little Bits But a Big Deal', which explains how bits of space debris present a very serious problem, how tiny fragments traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the carefully designed spacecraft. The articel being organized  helps the reader stay interested and understand better.

He asks questions in the beginning, he goes into a history lesson and then he closes with a thought that there needs to be a solution.
He starts with the begining middle and to end duh
The author begins with an exclamation to grab attention of the reader, he then begins telling the reader about microdebris and that it is becoming a very serious hazard. he then tells the reader about small objects the size of baseballs and smaller being left in space and how much damage they can cause to a well crafted spacecraft getting hit by a baseball sized object, he also gives a sandblaster example, how sand doesnt hurt if they wind blows it but they also use sand to remove paint with a sandblaster, showing the power change for the same object just different speeds.
To organize the article, the author breaks up the information into different categories. They have the introduction, then they have a section about space junk, after that there is a section about how the satelites crash, and lastly there is a section about how much of an impact the space junk has on people in space and on earth.
The author organizes the article by matter of importence.
The article has different segments in it with different information. All the articles talk about microdebris, so the whole article is talking about the samething in different segments.
The author organizes the article in a fair manner. He explains how the 'space junk' is really a serious matter. He states how some people might not care about this space junk, but they're are a great amount of people who care about what is exposed to outside of the earth. Not only is that junk but it is things to give us and NASA information. It also gives a good example of how the junk is released which they created a paragraph, 'Crash Course'. The paragraph, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' also explains how people don care about this junk.
The author organizes the article by giving each new subject a title.
The author organizes the article by the different topics she wants to cover. The first topic is all about space junk, while the second is all about the crash course, and the third is about little the space trash.
He starts out telling what space junk is. Then he goes and tells how satellites crash and make tiny debris. After that he talks about how the little debris can be a bid deal. He organizes it all by using the headings What is Space Junk, Crash Course, and Little Bits, But a Big Deal.
The author organizes this article in a particular order that it all ties together. He or she begins with a creative introduction to engage the reader, then proceeds to lead right into the main idea: space junk. He mentions the objects that have been sent into Eath's atmosphere and branches off the problem of satellites, and what happens when it malfunctions. He concludes this with the fact that this object will become space junk. This leads into the next paragraph where he explains problems that 'dead' satellites cause, and so on. The author continues to tie eveything together in this particular order throughout the entire passage.
He arranges the article into seperate topics by title.  The main subject of the sections are used in the title to give the reader an idea of what the purpose of that section is.  He does not clutter alot of different topics together, yet he organizes them to help understand how 'space junk' poses a problem to spaceships and satellites.
The author organizes this article by grouping different information together. Under 'What Is Space Junk?', an explanation is given of what it is. Under 'Crash Course', the author talks about examples of when space debris has become a problem to space exploration.
The author of the article organizes the writing in a logical way. They first describe what space junk is in 'What Is Space Junk?'. They do this by giving a short history on the space invasion and a short explanation on how a satellite can 'die' and hurtle uncontrolably through space. Then the author goes on to explain how space junk is created in the section 'Crash Course'. They explain how satelittes can collide and create massive amounts of microdebris that continue to orbit the Earth at incredible speeds. They also show how some astronauts can make mistakes such as losing the grip on their tool bag and causing the bag to begin orbiting the earth. In the final section, 'Little Bits, Big Deal', the author shows how dangerous this debris can be if it is traveling at a high rate of speed. The author provides startling evidence that microdebris can puch holes in spacecraft to inform the reader on the dangers of space junk.
The author divides the article into different sections to make it easier to read and to organize the topics.
The author starts their introduction by making a fun, eye catching statement. Then they put in a historical time in their article. The author decided to divide the article into sections to make it easier and more organized to undertstand.
The author organize this
The author organizes the article by breaking up the information into seperate headings and paragraphs.  This helps myself and other readers to understand the information better without getting bored.
The author organizes the artical from history to present, he/ she lists things for the matters they are in like say crash course they explain that the satilites crash from the course they are on. Then say what is space junk they tell you what space junk is and how it happend way back when. the person lets you know what the sections are about.
The author supports this article by giving a good and stronge reason and in diffrent areas to help and break down the problem in a simple way. Such as puting it in diffrent forms of phragraphs so that the read can better understand what the author is tring to tell the readers reading this. Although it is very long it toke a very complicated matter and put it into a simple form fo readers that are at a young age to fully understane the importance in space junk.
It is organized into sections on the junk in outer space.  They are telling you that it can be a very dangerous matter.  Each section is about different things.  Space trash is still increasing these days.  Without anyone at the controls dead satellites could collide with each other.
The author does ok. The author's reference to the tool bag in the first paragraph, isn't talked about again untill about two paragraphs later. I, as the reader, had no clue what the author meant by tool bag untill the end of the second topic.
The author of this article starts with an introduction that states once clear space is 'now cluttered with the remains of numerous space exploration and satellite missions.' The author then goes on to explain precisely what space junk is and how it has formed in the seciton entitled, 'What IS Space Junk?' The next section, entitled 'Crash Course', goes on to explain the harm that space debris can cause to spacecraft. 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' concludes the article by telling why we should care about space debris. The section also includes techniques that engineers are using to try and minimize damage done by the debris.
He explains it, when gives examples of things that have gotten lose in space.
The author organizes the article from most important to the least important.  The author goes form 'What is Space Junk' to 'Crash Course' and finally to 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'.  He goes this way because to understand what the reader is talking about, you must first understand what space junk is, and to understand why is it important, you have to know how dangerous space junk is by knowing that the space junk has crashed into and destroyed many spaceships.

The author organizes the article in different ways. such as What is Space Junk talks about all of the different things that do get sent out and lost or 'dies'. Crash course talks about how the dead satellites run into eachother.Also Little bits, But its a big deal explains that even though they can be little bitty pieces of the 'space junk' they do matter.
The author organizes the article by talking about the junk that is orbiting space now then explaning space junk to people who dont know what it is, and then after that explaining the harm and or problems that the junk could have on earth and even the people who travel out to space.
The author organized this article with a attention getter, and than some starlting facts after the fact you have been pulled in. Than the author gives some really startling facts that are really interesting. The author informs you how far away the junk is and how fast it can come back to earth and do some serious damage.
The author organizes the article much like one would see in a magazine. It includes headings with short paragraghes under them. The point of the article is made very clear in a short amount of space with many imperative facts and details. They make it interesting by giving each heading an apealing name such as 'Crash Course,' and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal.'
The author breaks up the artical into three different parts. He does that so that you can understand what the artical is talking about. If he mixed it all into one many people would be very confused. So he simplifies it so that the already hard topic he is bringing forward, is much easier to understand by the people reading the aritical.
the author organizes the article as a cause and effect article.  The author first talks about satellites being launched into orbit, 'Over the past 52 years, a variety of spacecraft, including space capsules, telescopes, and satellites, have been sent beyond Earth's atmosphere.'  Then describes how these satellites can malfunction or become damaged. Then the author descirbes how these malfunctioned and damaged satellites can collide and produce space junk. 'Now, instead of two disabled satellites, there are hundreds of microsatellites flying through space.'
he gets the tittle on what he want to wright about then he goes and tittles the story haedings.
I would say that the author organized this passage in a way of most important and which came first. In the passage 'What Is Space Junk', it talks about how satelites began and the last passage 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal',
The author organizes this article great. He drew me in by the introdtuction. The author also had very good detail on space junk and he had had an excellent body. The author really did a great job on organizing his article.
The author organizes this article in a very unique way. In the introduction he grabs your attention by stating  'Grab your telescope! Look up in the sky! It's a comet! It's a meteor!' By saying that the author has automatically grabbed your attention and you are now hooked in on reading the article. Then the author writes a series of important facts that can be useful for you to know.
By puting the stories in the right order on how it would happen first.
He organizes the article with telling us what spacejunk is. what it does, and how its dangerous.
he gives lots of information throughout the article.
The author organizes the article by building up information. He starts off with how it all started by explaining what space junk is. Then he tells us how sattelites will eventually crash into each other. Finally, he axplains how the results of those crashes will create debris that can cause a big problem with the Earth.
The Author organizes this article in three different sections. They start off by explaining what they are going to be talking about, space junk. Then they go on to give one way that space junk is effective and what it does to our outer space. Finally the author tells us about how even though space junk is very small and not many know about it or realize, it is very effective.
The author organizes this article by events that lead up to what his main topic is. he starts with the first artificial satellite and end with all the space trash in outer space now.
The author organizes the article by first, grabbing our attention in an artful, playful manner (Lines 1-2). The author then goes on to explain how space junk is created, although in a much more serious manner. Once the reader is clear on the causes of 'space junk', the author goes in-depth on what happens to these unwanted fragments, in the way of collissions, and free-orbiting satellites. Eventually, the author concludes how these little pieces of 'space trash' become dangerous to future foreys into the field of space travel, and advises that we seek a 'viable sollution'.
The author explains a story first for an example then he goes to his point. He tells wat space junk is then he tells why it is harfull even if we think it is not. He does this when he talks about stuff hitting each other in there orbit and when a simple toolbag could cause a problem.
First the author tills you what the article is all about then the author tills you the dangers of it.
The author starts out interseting.  Then they give us statistics about what has happened in the past years.  Around the sixth paragraph they give us examples.  By the eighth and ninth paragraphs they are talking about the bag, which was mentioned in the introduction.  The conclusion of this passage is saying that they hope to one day come up with a sollution to this.
The just use thing they know and but things where they belong. Like 'What is Space Junk' it explains to you what it is tells you everything they know baout the topic writen about the statements. They always look to make sure the things they have out in the passage makes sence with the topic it is under. They never put things that makes no sence in a passage like if they but and there was a bananas are monkey favorite food in there under 'What is Space Junk' it just dosent fit. They only use things that are clear and you help you to understand about the thing they are writing about.
It begins with a humorous statement meant to entertain the reader and lead him or her inot the next paragraph which tells the reader what the passage is going to be about. The next heading defines the subject and how it gets there. The next two paragraphs give specific examples of encounters with the subject, then it explains why we should care about this subject.
because it gives you a lead in what happenend or what it that.
The auther sets up the article in sections from describing what space junk is and how harmful it can be
IN SECTIONS SO IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A SPECIFIC ANSWER TO A QUESTION YOU JUST LOOK UNDER THE TOPIC IT MAY BE UNDER.
The article is organized by first giving a history about space exploration an example being when the Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite and how the United States followed along behind them. Next you are told about how things in an uncontrolled orbit collide with each other, functioning satellites, and even space ships. In the last section 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' you are informed that even though the space debris is small is can be dangerous. For example, even an object small than a baseball traveling at high speeds can cause large amounts of damage to satellites and space crafts. The overall organization of this starts off to tell you a history, give you examples, and detail problems that 'space junk' can cause.
He organize it in diffrent topics in the story. Like one topic is 'orbiting junk' and the next one is 'what space is' so he switchis off on diffrent topics. witch i think keeps you more intested in the story cause theres diffrent topics.
by telling what each topic is talking about and how those topics explain all the things about space
The author  believes that there needs to be less material in space. Eventualy they will all break down and fall into the earths atmosphere poluting it.
He begins with shocking statments to get the reader interested then he begins with the history behind all spacecrafts and how they were created and what purpose they were used for.
The article starts off with a childish realization through a telescope.  Then it gives a brief history of space exploration, and a couple incidents of space debris; including the 2009 satellite crash and the toolbag.  It then comes out and tells you how big of a problem things from a toolbag to destroyed satellites by telling you about a sandblaster and how it works and using it as a larger scale for objects in orbit.
He tells people how their is junk from the satelites hitting each other and that their is junk every where in the orbits.
The author organizes the article by sepreating the article into sections. The first section is called Orbiting Junk. The second is called What is space junk? The third is called Crash course. The fourth is called Little Bits, but a Big Deal. They break up these articles to seperate the different points of the article. So its not all in one combination.
He organizes the article by what happened in the past first and then talks about what is going to happened or what could happen.
The author organized his writing by sectioning his writing off.
He starts out as, describing space junk. Than he goes to crash course, and tells the reader if something extremely bad happens this is the approch. Than last he talks about space trash. He describes the outter space, with all of the trash floating around in it, from previous astronotes.      He goes into great detail about everything that he talks about, but also its not drawn out to where you fall asleep reading it. The author did a really good job of writing this article.
The author organizes the article by seperating the facts of everything.  The facts that he talked about include, the clutter in space, and when they launched the first artificial satellite and space junk got started, and who is going to take responsibility for the space trash.
The author organized the article with an introduction to the subject of the articles comes first. Then the author gives background information about the subject by talking about space programs and how space debris is created. It also presents some of the problems caused by space junk. The second to last section talks about the details of how some other forms of space junk occur, as well as how hard it is to prevent space junk from occuring. The final paragraph explains how space junk can damage ships, and how ships cannot avoid it easily. The article ends with a call to corporations to help solve the problem of space junk.
The first paragraph is to get the readers attention, and make them want to read the story. Then the tone changes in the section 'What Is Space Junk?' and because more serious. This section tells the reader what space junk is and how it got to be where it it.     The next section is called 'Crash Course' and it tells about what happens when two pieces of space junk collide, and it gives example of this happening in February 2009 with two communication satellites.     Section 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' is the last section, and it tells about how space junk is harmful and why this is such a serious matter. The section discusses how harmful little pices of junk can be for astronauts, and our space crafts that we send into space. The last paragraph tells about how spacejunk is increasing, and is still a problem. All nations are trying to work together to find a solution to the problem.
The author organizes the article by the development of space technology and the dates in which the statistics of space junk; staelites, telescopes and ect, are reconized.
The author uses titles before it opens up new information. For example one of the titles is Orbiting Junk, after that the author explains with information.
The author first used a hook to catch the reader's attention by using a question. Then he explained what space junk was, how satellites can crash into each other, how space debris is a big deal, how space debris is harmful, and how they are trying to come up with a solution for it.
The author organizes the article by giving you information about the junk and a time when an actual space invasion occured. Then the article goes into how people might think its not a big deal but it is.
The author organized the article by separating information into several different sections. First, he/she explained what space debris is in 'What Is Space Junk?'. Secondly, he/she used an example of the negative effects that space debris has caused to space in ' Crash Course'.Then finally, they use information from space agencies around the world to show the effects on the countries on Earth in 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'.
IT WAS NOT ORGANIZED WELL
My opinion of this article is that it is well organized and well written. Why I say that is because it grabbed my atttention expecially in the introduction. As I followed along and continued to read the facts and concerns of this article made me want to read it.
The author oraginizes the article in varies ways. He first gets our attention by using questions and loud statements to get our attnetion. Then he shows us the harm in space junk and gives us facts about the way we are taking care of the atmosphere. THen he leads us to the end where he tells us what we can do to avooid harmful situations and gives us tips on how to improve our wasteful tendencies.
The author organizes the article by first informing the reader about the topic of space junk. History is used to give an accurate example of space junk. After some background information is given, the author uses statistics and facts to show the reader how dangerous space junk can be. Lastly, the author ties up the last paragraph emphasizing the damage space junk can do and what a threat it can be in the future. The author end the article with a concerned tone and uses the organization of the article to fully inform the reader.
The other orginizes this article by starting off with a introduction that gets you attention. Then is gives a brief history entitled 'What Is Space Junk?'. After that secton it moves onto  a more recent accident with space junk, and finishes the article off with the dangers of the little debri.
The author of 'Orbiting Junk' organizes his article into several subtopics so that the reader can clearly see the change of subjects in the article making it easier to read. The subtopic 'What Is Space Junk' talks about and defines what space junk really is, while 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' talks about the relavence of space junk and its effect on space travel.
He grabs your attention with a little action. Then he explains what space junk is and it can damage space things. How little things make a big deal.
The author organizes the article in such a way the reader can follow along easily, without much confusion. Before he/she goes on to inform you about the trouble space junk is causing, they inform you what space junk is. Then they inform you of some of the things that are happening because of space junk, as in satellites crashing together. And they conclude by telling how big of a problem space junk has been and will be, because 'the amount of space trash is actually increasing.'
The author organizes it into different subsections based of what the subject of the section is
First, the author talks about Space junk and tells wehen the first artificial satellite was launched. Then, the author talks about how this ''space junk'' is currently of great concern to the government agencies.
The author puts this article in a weird way, He or she starts by a eye catching introduction and then goes to a boring history lesson about satelittes and space junk. Then the author takes us into another exciting paragraph about satelittes crashing into each other and it just goes on and on until the article is over but somehow at the end of it all i still wanted to know more.
At first the author uses a suprising statement to grab the readers attention, and bring them into the article itself.     Next the author discusses the seriousness of space junk circling our planet.     The author than defines what space junk is, and than gives a brief history on where space junk came from.      The author than talks about the dangers of space junk colliding with other objects such as functional sattalites and human being who are workign outside of their spacecraft.     Finally the author talks about how dangerous even the smallest pieces of space debris can be extremely harmful, and how scientists and entire nation are working together to solve the problem of 'Space Junk'.
The author organizes the article but making side headings of the more important things about space and space junk and orginizing information to go into those areas.
The organization of the article is information in each section, while collectively, the sections map out a situation that could cause 'space junk.' The introduction, which obviously introduces the topic and provides a summary of the sections yet to come is followed by 'What is Space Junk' immediately afterword. Before defining space junk, a historical anecdote is given but as the facts progress conflict is introduced. The idea of an object malfunctioning is given, and an actual example of the space junk causing problems is conceived while still keeping a linear outline of the mostly informative article. Following the history of the satellites in space and their possible malfunctioning, 'Crash Course' provides an example from February 2009 shows how two satellites could collide and created hundreds of pieces of smaller debris which is elaborated in the final section, 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'. The small pieces of debris or the example given in 'Crash Course' of a tool bag are shown to be problematic and with both facts and descripitive paragraphs the informative article becomes somewhat of a story by saying,     'Tiny fragments traveling at a speed of five miles per second can inflict serious damage on the most carefully designed spacecraft.' This section almost serves as a conclusion to the situation in which the space junk can be harmful. The organization of the article is both informative in some paragraphs but simultaneously follows a linear, yet non-descript situational plot.
the author organizes the artical but putting stictics in first before try to persuade the readres what really happen i think it is really good becuase people need to know the true facts.
The author seperates the article into different sections that have information that goes along with cooresponding information in each of the sections. For example in the section crash course there is a detailed explanation of how two satellites collided in 2009. In the section it first tells the reader what could possibly happen and then gives an example or a possible scenario.In another example the author titles a section 'What Is Space Junk?' The author tells of how 52 years of space exploration has polluted the space just outside Earth's atmosphere. Then the author describes what the kinds of 'junk' are found in space from these previous space missions.
The author organized this to where he could draw attention to the passage. Starting with the rehtorical questions, then describing space junk. Telling the reader how it got there, and what peoples reaction is to the space junk.
The author seems to organize the article with a clearly defined introduction that is titled 'Orbiting Junk' that is used to introduce the subject. The author then uses two sections to explain what 'space junk' is and why it is such a big danger. He then proceeds to have a conclusion section titled 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal', which explains why such small pieces of debris can prove to be very harmful.
The introduction of this article grabs your attention and makes you want to read more about it. 'What is Space Junk?' describes the events that have occured overtime with the mircodebris and satelliates in space. 'Crash Course' tells about how two satellites collided into each other in an orbit around the Earth's orbit. It also tells that not only is it spectacular crashes that create this debris, it's ANY object. 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal' tell about how much people truly care about what's going on in space. It also tells about how dangerous microdebris can be if not avoided.
The author begins the article with fun interesting words that grab the reader and then he jumps into the seriuous matter of the story.
The author organizes the article in a way were the reader first recieves information on what space junk really is, then the harmful consequences Earth could face when two satellites do collide.
The author organizes the article by putting the same subjects together into paragraphs and different topics in different paragraphs.
FROM FUN NEWS TO REALLY BAD INFORMATION ABOUT TODAY OUTTER SPACE
The author starts off the passage with a comical line, 'Grab your telescope! Look up in the sky! It's a comet! It's a meteor! It's a . . . tool bag?' From their the author begins explaining the term 'space junk' and some space travel history as to how space debris came to be. Further on, the author switches tones to explain how serious this space junk can be. He provides an exapmle of when two satellites, one Russian and one American, collided in space and created hundreds of pieces that now helplessly oribit earth. Then he makes a comparison with how dangerous and affective sand can be when shot at such a fast rate. He does this to prove that even the smallest fo space junk can pose a threat to space ships entering space.
He first explains what is beyond the Earth's atmospere and how it got there, then explains that the things that are beyond the Earth's atmospere do break and become an issue, after that he explains how they have a big effect on things.
He organizes it by getting the readers attention by starting it with a shocking sentence, then he casually starts explaining how dangerous space junk really is.
The author does an excellent job at ordering the information of this article. They begin with an attention-getter in the opening paragraph to grab the reader's attention, 'Grab your telescope! Look up in the sky!', then move into describing the topic of their article, space junk, more clearly, 'The disabled object becomes a piece of high-tech junk...' The following paragraphs explain how space junk comes to be, 'With no one at the controls, dead satellites run the risk of colliding with each other', and the article closes with the dangers of space junk, 'Those bits of space debris present a very serious problem.'
The author of 'Orbiting Junk' organizes the article into four sections.  The introduction brings up the idea of space junk and explains that it is causing a global governmental concern.  The author goes on to explain what space junk is and transitions into why it is a problem in the next two paragraphs.  Finally, the author wants to raise awareness that the volume of space trash is in fact increasing and that it is difficult to avoid.
They organize it by using ancadotes as the introductions then breaking down the article into sections that discuss the different topics.
to make it sound like its a big deal that space junk is a big problem so he gets peoples attention.
The author organizes the article by lining up the statistics well and providing alot of useful information in the article. The reader is very educated by the end of the article.
The author organizes the article in multiple sections. they have a section titled 'What Is Space Junk?', 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'.
The author seperates the article into different parts. There are four main parts. There are three main parts each with a different topic on space junk.     In the first the author uses a humerous appraoch like, 'It's a... tool bag?' but then moves to a more serious tone. The author explains that it is a serious issue.     the author presents the dangers and problems in the later sections. Finally, at the end he says how many nations contribute to the problem and it must be solved. So first he gets your attention, then the next section explains what it is, and the last two present the issues and the seriousness of it while concluding the paper.
By giving insight on the problem, then giving solutions.
He talks about the history of Space and how we have satellites. Then talks about the importance of saellite debris and how it can be very dangerous.
The author starts out gentle and says the facts straight out. The author starts to get very harsh and starts to state that this is a serious matter. The organization of this artical not only helps keep a eye on it, but it helps to tell us about this and what will happen to stuff in the atmosphere. From going to gentle and easing us into the more painful facts was a great way to write this artical.
He starts of with a attention getter and goes into the seriousness of the essay. then he explains how thesse things happen and shows just because they are small doesnt mean they are not effective.
He puts it impportanc.
The author organizes the article into several sections: the intro, 'What Is Space Junk?', 'Crash Course', and 'Little Bits, But a Big Deal'. The first section defines 'space junk' for the reader. Section two explains how debris can be formed by colliding satellites, and section three explains why space junk is a problem.
black :: black might affect the dog house because then the doghouse can get to hot for the dog. iknow this because in the resul ts black got the hottest.
white :: White because you wouldn't want the dog to ge t to hot.
white :: the color white will reflect the suns rays of f of it because in the lab the color white had the lowest tempeture, and black absorbed the heat so it was hotter and if they had the doghouse pai nted black the dog would get to hot and die. so white
white :: this color will keep the dog house cooler ins ide because it doesn't heat up as fast. the average time for the glass to heat up was 42 degrees in 10 minutes.
white :: I would use a light color like White in this case because if its 95 degrees outside and you have a black dog house the dog house is going to be hot.Like in the experiment they used they used a black lid because it would make the jar the hotest.
light gray ::  The darker of color the , the hoter it g ets
light gray :: i think it will affect it by the doghou se atrackting heat and if neede they could paint it another color when it gets colder of warmer
black ::  the color would absorb more heat from the sun making it hotter in the doghouse
light gray :: i chose light gray because i was thinking of temperatures of the seasons. in summer the light gray will reflect some o f the heat while keeping it alittle warm inside, in winter the ligh t gray will absorb alittle of the sun light making it alittle warm inside .
white :: It will kepp the dog house cool and not to ho t because in the table a black lid had an average of 58 degrees and the w hite lid had an averge of 42 degrees. There for if the dog house was pain ted a darker color the doghouse would get to hot inside.
black ::  The black colored doghouse would be warmer on the inside. The average temperature with the black lid was 53(DEG), the average temperature for the dark gray lid was 48(DEG). The average temp erature for the light gray was 45(DEG) and for the white it was 42(DEG) . There is a 11(DEG) difference between the black and white colored lid. So the black doghouse would have the most heat on the inside.
white :: the color white will reflect the sunlight just like the white lid reflected the light from the lamp in the experiment.
white ::  it would reflect a lot of the light and heat making it cooler inside the doghouse.
white :: it will give the dog more cool air because li ghter colors absorb cool air instead of heat
black :: Well the darker the lid is the more tempayure goes into the jar. and the avarege of the black lid was 53(DEG)C.
white :: they would want to choose white for the summer because it wont attract alot of heat. they would want to use black for the winter to attract more heat
dark gray ::  All choosable colors are waht you might call a 'double edged sword' because, altough the dark colors will keep the dog warm in winter, it'll make him to hot in summer. And while the light col ors will keep him cool in summer, they wont do much for him in winter.
black :: it will keep the inside of the dog house warm er
light gray :: Light Gray Is The Best Color To Use Because I tself Is That Dark Of A Color So The Dog Wont Burn Up(Darker Color=Increa se In Heat Tempeture)And Not That Light That The Dog Would Be Cold.
white ::  Brandi and Jerry should use white paint becau se in the experiment, the jar with the white lid increased the least in t emperature. It increased 18(DEG)C while the black lid made the temperatu re increase 29(DEG)C. Therefore, the white paint should be used so that the dog house doesn't overheat.
white :: The color white would affect the doghouse it so it may be cooler inside because of the lack in absorbing energy.
light gray :: on cold days the light gray absorbs the hotte r temp. and on hot days it douse not absorb as much.
white ::  The best color to paint the dog house would b e white. White reflects more light than black. This would keep the inside temperature of the dog house cooler than it would if the dog house were painted black. In the experiment, the white lid was at an average of 11(DEG) C cooler than the jar with the black lid. Therefore, the white would be the bes t color to paint the dog house.
light gray :: the doghouse should be light gray because it does not absorb to much heat or to little heat so the dog won't be to hot or to cold it will be just right
white :: If they colored the doghouse white then it wi ll be cool inside and not so hot like it would be if it was black. Because when the jar lid was black the inside of the jar was 53(DEG)C an d when it was white the inside of the jar was 42(DEG)C
dark gray :: The air inside will be hotter than it would b e with the light gray and white as the roof color so the dog can stay war m at night but it also be colder than if the black was the roof color so the dog won't get too hot during the day.
white ::  The color might affect the dog house just a l ittle bit, because the white color had the lowest temp. compared to the b lack wich its average was 53. Thats a(n) 11 (DEG)c diferanc an the dark grey was a(n) 6(DEG)c differance. also the light gray was a(n) 3(DEG)c differance.
black :: It will effect the dog house by it being more hot cause on the chart it showed black was the hottest
light gray :: The light gray color would reflect some of th e light energy, but also absorb a little so the doghouse would not get to o hot or cold. The white color had an average of 42(DEG)C after 10 minut es, which might be too cold. The dark gray had an average of 48(DEG)C, w hich might be too hot.
black :: no color will affect the doghouse
dark gray ::  Dark gray would be a good color for the dogho use because it would not be too hot inside. If you were to do black the dog would get a lot hotter because it would absorb more heat. In every trial for dark gray it created 48(DEG)C. This seems like a pretty good temperature for a dog house.
black :: Black is my choice because if it kept the jar warm for ten minutes then black would be able to keep a doghouse warm for longer.
black ::  I chose black because the sun wont reflect th e color black and it wont effect inside the dog house.
white ::  It will make the dog house cooler
black :: because it's so string
white ::  It should be white. The white lid average was 42(DEG)C and it was the lowest average of temperature for the experimen t.
white :: The white color reflected the most thermal en ergy and will keep the dog cool.
dark gray ::  It will make it warmer than a light grey or w hite doghouse, but cooler than a black doghouse. This is better because d ogs generally use a doghouse to hide from the rain in winter, and my colo r will keep it warmer. However, they are also used in summer, and as such should not be black, as that would make it unusable during summer.
black :: The black doghouse would keep you warmer in t he winter but it would be really hot in the summer
white :: the color will keep the dog house cool on the inside so on hot summer days the dogs can be nice and cool
black ::  Black paint would affect the doghouse by making it the warmest because according to the data black had the highest average of temperature which was 53(DEG)C, which is warmer than the other 3 tested colors. So to me I think black would be the best color.
light gray ::  I chose light gray becasue it won't make the dog feel sad.
light gray ::  The light gray color would keep the doghouse mild and warm. On average, the light gray colored lid went from 24(DEG) C to 42(DEG) C (a difference of 21(DEG) C). Compared to the black color ed lid, which went from 24(DEG) C to 53(DEG) C (a difference of 29(DEG) C, which is too hot). Or the white colored lid which went from 24(DEG) C to 4 2(DEG) C (a difference of 18(DEG) C). Therefore, a gray colored roof would be perfect for a doghouse.
white :: white will keep the dog house nice and cool s ince according to there data the white lid kept the air in the jar cooles t.
black :: the black one will have a good heat for the d og because in the trial the black lid was average was 53 (DEG)c .
white :: the color of the dog house will affect the te mperature of the inside of the dog house. the color white will keep the t emerature lower than the other colors.
light gray ::  I think white would be the best color for the doghouse becuase according to the experiment it was the coldest so in th e summer when it is hot outside the doghouse will not be to hot.
white :: Brandi and Jerry should paint their doghouse white because the color absorbs less heat, so it will keep it cool and no t too hot for the doggy.
light gray :: It wont be to hot on sunny days and it wont be to cold on cloudy days.
white :: White would be the best color for the doghous e because it would keep the dog cooler. White would absorb less solar and thermal energy, therefore lowering the temperature within the doghouse. In the experiment, the air temperature in the jar with the white lid aver aged 42(DEG) C, while the black lid jar averaged 53(DEG) C. The light g ray lid produced and air temperature of 45(DEG) C and the dark gray lid made the air temperature in the jar 48(DEG) C.
"black :: Black will make the dog house warmer inside b ecause darker colors absorb more energy. And in ""Air Temperature"" the average temp. for black was 53(DEG), while the average for white was 42(DEG) . Every starting temperature started at 24(DEG), therfore, black would be the best color to choose for the dog house."
"black ::  black will be the based color for the dog hou es because.In the chart ""lid color vs.Air temperture Inside Glass Ja r""black hade 54 in trial 1and52 in trial 2 and 53 in trail 3.Dark gr ay,Light gyay,and White where in the low to high 40's.black will keep the dog house warm or cool when needed."
light gray :: The color light gray will affect the inside o f the dog house because it will get warm but not too hot because if you h ave a dog house that is way to hot the dog might die and since dog houses are always out in the sun the dog house will become extremely hot becaus e in the experiment the lid colors were only left under a lamp for about only 10 min and the temperature went up very quickly.
white :: Using white paint would be a great paint colo r for the doghouse because if its white it won't recieve that much sunlig ht and so it would be cooler. If you look at the data table it would show you that when it has white paint it is below 45(DEG)c so white would be a great doghouse color.
white :: Because white does not asborb as much energy so it would be cooler in the dog house.
black :: If Brandi and Jerry use black, then the tempe rature will be warmer, because it has the highest average temperature at 53(DEG)C.If they use white, then it will bne colder, because the average when white was 42(DEG)C. Therefore the darker the doghouse the warmer i t will be because black was 11(DEG)C more than white.
white ::  the white colored paint might make the inside o the dog house colder than out side on a hot day s ohe or she dont get way to hot.
light gray :: It would be a good color because it wouldnt b e too cold or too hot for the dog. it would be just right.
white ::  On a hot summer day, it's easy for dogs to ge t overheated, harming them and even killing them. Therefore, white is the best color of paint to use because the air inside of it only increases b y 18(DEG)C after ten minutes of exposure to light and heat. With black p aint, it increases by 29(DEG)C, which could definately be detrimental to a dogs health.
black :: Because the doghouse will have a higher tempe rature because black absorbs more solar energy, which will transform into thermal energy
white ::  I think the dog house should be white because it would keep the dog cool in the hot summer sun.
dark gray :: I chose a darker color like dark gray, becasu e it will absorb more energy so the dog will hopefully much warmer in the winter. However, another reason I chose a dark gray instead of black is that it's also lighter in color compared to the black and will hopefully not get too hot in the summer.
white :: because the lighter the colors are the least heat energy is going to be absorbed.
light gray ::  This would affect the doghouse because some l ight would be attracted to the house but not too much. In their experimen t the light gray lids tempature was 45(DEG). This would be a good tempat ure for the dog house because in the summer the dog would have enough sha de so that it would not over heat, but in the winter it would be warm eno ugh so that the dog would not be cold.
white :: White would keep the dog house cooler. White does attract heat like the color black does. When started at 24(DEG)C, t he black lidded jar went up to an average of 53(DEG)C. And the white lid ded jar, which also started at 24(DEG)C, only went up to an average of 42(DEG)C.
white ::  I would use white paint because it would keep the doghouse cooler. The doghouse will be cooler because the white paint will reflect the light and keep the doghouse cooler.
white ::  it will afect the dog house by the temp in si de becaes the wight atracks less height
white :: i chose white so it would be cool in the summ er
white :: the best color to choose would be white becau se on average white had the lowest temperature of all the colors meeaning the inside of the doghouse would be cooler
light gray :: Light gray will be that color because you cou ld actually what color you are doing like when you paint that house and m aybe in the hot summer it wont be as hot if you paint the house bla ck.
white ::  according to the experiment in which the jar with the white lid had the lowest air temperature, the color white will keep the inside of the dog house cooler because white does not absorb lig ht.
white :: It well allow it to be coler then bieng hot.
white :: It might affect the temperature inside the do ghouse. The data shows that the white lid has the lowest temperature, the refore making it the best color to build the doghouse with.
white ::  the color white would keep the dog house nice and cool inside in a hot summer day.
white :: The white paint should keep the inside temper ature of the doghouse cooler on a hot day, than say black paint for examp le. When comparing the average temperatures of all the lid colors the whi te lid kept the glass jar at a cooler temperature. On average about 6.6(DEG) C cooler, compared with the averages for the other lids. So, therefore white pa int is the better choice, especially if you are looking to keep the insid e of the dog house cool for your dog on a hot day.
white :: In the expirement is stated that light er col ors are cooler than darker colors.White is a very light color and light c olors don't absorb very much jeat so that means that the dog house won't be to hot.
light gray :: Light gray would be best because it would absorb a little heat but not to much. Its average temperature was 45 degrees which was the middle result of the three so in the winter the dog house would still bring in some heat for the dog and in the summer it wo uld keep some of the heat out to keep the dog cool.
white ::  if the dog house was white then when it is ho t the dog house would be cooler.in the experiment it showed that the aver age tempature for the air was 43 celcius and all the other colors made it hotter like the black lid was 53 celcius.
white :: White will affect the dog house by making it cooler. In the trials, the lighter the color the cooler the tempurature w as.
dark gray ::  dark grey because in the summer it wont be to hot and in the winter it wont be to cold.
black :: Black would be a good color for the doghouse because black absorbs more heat. Black absorbs more heat because it is made of no color so it does not reflect any color of light which means it absorbs all the light. In the experiment, the black held an average of 53(DEG) C after being under the lamp for ten minutes. The white lid had an average inside temperature of 42(DEG)C after beign under the lamp for ten minutes. This is a difference of 11(DEG)C and is because white is made up of all the colors so it reflects all colors of light whereas the black relfects no light.
black :: Black will affect the doghouse by makeing it hotter.
white :: the color i chose, white, would affect the te mperature because white absorbs less light making the doghouse not as hig h in temperature.
white :: The color of the dog house being white wil ca use the doghouse to stay cooler under sunlight. This is beacuse the color white reflects the light away from the doghouse, and the light will not be absorbed and turned into heat energy inside the doghouse.
black ::  The black would be better to use for a paint color because it will make the doghouse warmer for the dog because in the experiment black made the jar the warmest.
black :: If you use the black then the doghouse would stay warm when ever the sun is out beacause the sun would get more light because it is darker.
dark gray :: Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse dark gray because the temperature, according to their data, is 48(DEG)C and it's perfect temperature, not too cold nor hot, and it barely changes temperature.
white :: The best color to choos for a dog house is wh it because it will keep the dog cooler and it will not get dehidrated. Th e dog will stay cooler inside the white doghouse.
white :: Lighter color means cooler house.
black :: the best paint color for the house would be b lack because it would keep the dog warmer than other colors would. the bl ack lid was 53(DEG), and all others were between 42 and 48(DEG)
light gray :: This color would effect the doghouse because it would not be to hot or to cold.
white :: The color black tends to make things hotter a nd so if u used a white lid it would keep the tempature down if it was a sunny day. For the black lid in the experiment the tempature increased( t emp:54) and for the white it decresed(temp:42). This is because the energ y is sucked out from the dark colors. Also dogs have alot of fur so it wo uld be best to have a cooler house.
white :: I would paint the dog house white. The highes t temperature was 53(DEG) for the black lid. Which would cause the dog t o overheat. While the lowest temperature was 42(DEG) for the white lid. Which would help the dog stay cool. So i would paint my dog house white b ecause it is 11(DEG) cooler than painting it black.
white :: the white is better for the dog house because it wont get to hot inside and not to cold.the hotest it would get in the house is 43 and the coldest it would get is 41
dark gray :: i dont think it will efect it because it has the same number for each trial
white ::  I think white is the best coler out of all of the choses here because black is not esey to find in the dark but white is esey to find.
black :: it might blow it up
white :: this color is the best becouse it wont atract so much heat energy and it would be fresh for the dog
white :: it will start like geeting old and it wont look like new anymore it will have like scratches and mud and some black things
white :: it would be much cooler inside the dog house because the color is light and reflects light better. as it said in the r esults, it had the lowest temperaute of 42 degree's Celcius
light gray :: I chose light gray as a good color for the do ghouse because the color does not absorb as much energy as a darker color such as black. The color black which absorbs a lot of energy, results in high temperatures in the doghouse compared to a lighter color such as li ght gray that still absorbs some energy but not as much and causes lower temperatures. Based on the experiment, the results show that that light g ray absorbs enough energy to keep the average temperature inside the jar at 45(DEG)C, 8(DEG)C less than black which absorbs more heat and causes higher temperatures. Therefore, a good color option for a doghouse would be light gray.
black :: the darker the doghouse color, the greater th e increase in air temperature in the doghouse because the color absorbs m ore energy. In the experiment, the color black absorbed the most energy, causing the inside of the jar to be the warmest. The results for black we re 54 (DEG)C, 52 (DEG)C, 54 (DEG)C, and 53(DEG)C. While all the other colors that were lighter, absorbed less energy.
white ::  i honestly would most likly choose white because all dark colors (dark gray, black,light gray) the sun just like gets it realy hot and all light colors (white) the sun reflects off of it so w hite would be best because it would keep the dog when its in the dog house white would keep it not so hot but it would still be hot on a hot day but thats my opinion and thats why i would pick white, what would u pick?
black :: Dark colors like black and dark gray absorb m ore energy and make it hotter than if I used white or light gray.
white :: it would keep the doghouse cooler because the white lid kept the jar the cooler than the other lids did
black :: The doghouse will be warmer. The doghouse wil l be warmer because in the experiment the black bolor lid was the warmest .
light gray :: They would want it between black and white so it will be warm and cool. The tests showed that Dark or Light gray is ab out 46.5(DEG)C so it will be good for the dog.
dark gray :: i think dark gray because in the summer it wo nt get to hot but in the winter the color will still gather energy to kee p the dog house fairly warm.
white :: How the white paint will affect the dog house is it wont absorb so much heat, so the dog wont be as hot. If Brandi an d Jerry were to choose black paint it will absorb all the heat because in the experiment in trial one its ((DEG)C) was 54, in trial two its ((DEG) C) were 52, in trial 3 its ((DEG)C) were 54 and the average is 53. So these re sults show that the doghouse will contstanly be warm so this will not mak e the dog comfortable with all the heat. While the white lid in the exper iment had very low temperatures its ((DEG)C) were 42,43,41 and its avera ge came to 42 ((DEG)C) so this shows that the white will absorb barley a ny heat.
"black :: Black would be the best color to paint the do ghouse, because it would attract the heat and keep the inside of the dogh ouse warm. According to the results of Brandi and Jerry's experiment "" lid vs. air temperature"" the balck lid kept the inside of the jar warmer t han any of the other colored lids. So, therefore the black paint would ke ep the inside of the doghouse warmer than any of the other colors."
dark gray :: because that would be the color to choose
white :: I chose white because white is a nice cool te mperture and dogs have fur so then they would be even a little bit hotter . The reason i know that white would be a pretty good temperture is becau se in the experement the white lid was averaged to be 42 degrees calcus, and so that is apretty good temperature for the dog house.
dark gray :: it might get a little warm in the day time bu t it will keep the inside of the dog house warm in the night.
white :: The color white would be a great color to use in a doghouse because the inside of the doghouse would be cooler for the dog soo when its hot then it wont be to hot in its house. I say this bec ause the average temp of the color white is 42(DEG)C while the other 3 c olors are above this average temp.
light gray :: This could color might affect the doghouse, b ecause the temperature in the doghouse could change depending on the temp erature outside the doghouse.
white ::  The color White might affect the inside of th e doghouse by keeping it the coolest. The average for the color black was 53(DEG)C, the average for Dark Grey was 48(DEG)C, the average for Ligh t Grey was 45(DEG)C, and the average for White was 42(DEG)C. This shows that White is the coolest color and should be used for the doghouse to k eep the doghouse cool.
white :: If the doghouse was white then when it is hot outside the dog will be cold, and when it is cold outisde the dog has fu r to keep him warm.
white ::  The doghouse will stay cool because white ref lects all the colors heat so the house will stay cool.
black ::  the color black heats the doghouse the most. it gets to 53 degrees celcius in there where as dark grey=48 degrees, lig ht grey=45 degrees, and white=42 degrees. so black would be the best colo r
dark gray :: the dark gray will obsorb some heat and keep the dog house warm
black :: Black will affect the dog house by heating it up because black absorbes more energy.
white :: White was written down as the coolest in the test and you would want the dog house to be cool when it is hot out.
white :: The internal temperature of the doghouse will be cooler than a doghouse that is colored black. This is only the case i f the external temperatures are hot and the dog needs a cool place.
white ::  White is the best color for a doghouse roof because in the summer the white would reflect light and heat from the doghouse keeping it nice and cool inside for the dog the doghouse is for. After all would you want your dog to be uncomfortable on a hot summer day? I chose white to be the best color for a doghouse roof because the average air temprature inside the jar with the white lid was cooler than the air temprature in the light gray, dark gray, or black lidded jars. With a starting temprature of 24(DEG)C for each jar after ten minutes the temprature of the air in jar with the white lid had a average temprature of 42(DEG)C while the jar with the highest average air temprature of 53(DEG) C was the jar with a black lid which means the jar with the white lid had an average air temprature 11(DEG) C cooler than the average of the jar with the black lid. Which is quite a diffrence if you ask me.
black :: The doghouse should be painted black because then the dog will stay warm during the winter if he/she has to stay outsi de. When the black lid was used in the expiriment, it was on averag e 5 degrees warmer inside the jar than with the dark gray lid, 8 degrees warmer than the light gray lid, and 11 degrees warmer than the white. The refore, if the doghouse is painted black, the dog will keep warm much bet ter than if the doghouse was painted dark gray, light gray, or white.
"black :: Having a black doghouse will keep the dog warm in the winter because the ""Hot Lamp"" experiment shows that darker colors obsorbe more heat than lighter colors."
light gray :: The darker the color, the warmer the doghouse would be (black warmest 54(DEG)C). The dog might overheat if the doghouse is too hot. the lighter the color, the colder the doghouse (white lowest 41(DEG)C). They wouldnt want the doghouse to be uncomfortibly cold. so dark grey or light grey would be best (avg. 46.5(DEG)C).
light gray :: brandi and jerry should paint the doghouse L IGHT GREY because the dor wouldnt get to hot because his dog houdse is a dark color and it wouldnt get to cold either with a very light color so t hat is why they sbould paint it light grey because its not to light and i ts not to dark and also the experiment tells us that the average tempertu re in celsius for light grey was 45(DEG) and for black it was 53(DEG) a nd dark grey 48(DEG) and for white was 42(DEG) light grey is the averag e of them all, 53 ( black) - 48 (dark grey) = 5 53 (black) - 45 ( light grey) = 8 and 53 (black) -42 ( white) = 11 light grey (8) is i n the middle of both 5 and 11 so light grey is the color they should pain t the dog house.
black ::  It will make the dog house warmer inside
light gray ::  Light gray would be the best color for the do g house because it would absorb some heat, but would not absorb as much a sthe color black. If they chose black they dog house would absorb to much heat as shown in the experement that after just 10 minutes the temperatu re of the black lid jar rose 29(DEG)c but the light grey lid jar only ro se 21(DEG)c. Since black absorbs so much heat, it could cause the dog to be to hot, but light grey allows the dog to still have some heat just no t as much.
light gray :: the color would keep the dog house cooler tha n the darkgrey and black color.also its warmer than the white colored hou se.
black ::  The color black absorbs all the colors of lig ht so the inside of the doghouse would be hot becase the color is absorbi ng and trapping the heat from the light.
light gray ::  dark colors makes things really hot for examp le the black reached up to 54* C white color makes things a little to cold for example it only reached up to 43* C the color gray would have the perfect affect for inside the dog house to make sure the dog wasnt to cold but was to hot because for example the color gray reaced up to 46* C at most making it an equal balance between to hot and to cold.
white ::  White will be better for the doghouse because it will be more heat efficiant and will let in less heat. if black was u sed it absorbs more heat then lighter colors would.
black :: cuhzz i t will effect it cuhz black is a rlly dark colerr,so yahh....
black :: The color will affect the doghouse by making the temperature rise high that it will be to hot for the he or she dog. Also on Trial 1 after 10 minutes it rised to 54(DEG)c which is to h igh the best color to paint a dog house would be white that was 42(DEG)c after 10 minutes.
white :: it would make it nice and cool for the dog
white ::  The temperature inside the dog house will be cooler than if they use a darker color such as black.
white :: brandi and jerry would want to paint th e dog house light gray. painting the dog house light gray would be the b est paint to color the bog house because in the experiment they had foun d out that, painting the house black absorbs more heat energy, and pain ting it white will not absorb enoff energy, so in the middle will be the best for the dog. so not too much thermal energy, but some thermal energy being abosrbed is best.
white :: The best one would be white, because the whit e one absorbs less energy. The black one absorbs a lot of energy, the ave rage of the black one was 53(DEG)C. Average for the dark gray was 48(DEG)C. The average for the light gray was 45(DEG)C, and the white wa s 42(DEG)C. The darker the color the more energy it absorbs. The lighter the lesser it absorbs energy.
white :: the color white won't attract as much light a s the black so the dog won't have to suffer really hot weather on sunny d ays. the white compared to the black is a better choice because black col or attracts more light, for example it averaged a 53(DEG)C while the whi te averaged a 42(DEG)C. That is a ll(DEG)C difference.
black ::  so the dog will stay warm at night.
white :: because it could get dirty or somethen.
black ::  i chose black so the inside of the dog house can be warm at about 53(DEG)C and wont get cold over the time the dog is outside
"white :: Well the color ""white"" makes it so that inside of the doghouse would be more cooler because the sun reflects off white and it wont be as hot inside the doghouse."
white ::  i chose white because the darker colors absorb more heat energy that the lighter colors
"black :: I believe that the best color for the dog hou se would be black especially in the winter because it will keep the inside of the dog house warm because the darker the color of the object the greater increase in air temperature inside the object according to th e data table in ""Hot Lamp"" so the darker the color the warmer t he house or object."
white ::  According to the reults, the lighter the colo r, the colder the temperature is. Since white had less heat, they would w ant to paint the dog house white.
black :: if the doghouse is black then it will be warm er. i know this because the jar with the black lid h ad an average temperature of 53(DEG)c
white :: The color white would keep the doghouse the c oolest temperature . On average , the color black is 53(DEG)C , dark gre y is 48(DEG)C, light grey is 45(DEG)C, and white is 42(DEG)C .
black :: this color will keep the inside of the dog ho use warm during winter because dark color absorbs more heat energy.
light gray :: Light gray might affect the the doghouse by k eeping the inside colder for the dog.
white :: By painting the doghouse white, the inside of the doghouse will be cool acording to the results of the experiment. The data shows that when the lid was black, the air temperature was warmest, and when the lid was white, the air temperature was coolest. Therefore, painting the doghouse white would create a more comfortable temerpature f or the dog.
light gray :: because light gray is in between hot and cold so the doghouse wont be to hot for him to stay in or too cold for the dog to stay in black being hottest and white being coolest
black :: black will mack it hot in the dog house because the lap is hiting black and black atrackes heat
light gray :: Light gray would be a great color for a dogho use. Although it can still cause an affect. The light gray color can caus e the dog house to not have the right temperature in side. The results wo uld be that if the color was light gray is would be about a good temperat ure inside the dog house. Like in Trial 1 in the jar the temperature was 44, in Trial 2 the temp. was 45, Trial 3 it was 46 as the temperature. The average was 45, so with that said the light gray color is good enough because the average temp. is no t as bad and it wouldnt be so dark inside.
white :: White. It is the colour of all the others in the experiment with the lowest average temperature rise of 18(DEG) C. In the experiment, the starting temperature of was 24(DEG) C and after ten minutes under a lamp, the air inside the jar increased by 18(DEG) C. To tal of 42(DEG) C. If black was chosen to be the doghouse colour, it will not be suitable for the doghouse because the average temperature rise wo uld be too high.
black :: the darker the lid color the greater the incr ease in air temperature
black ::  The wood will be hot
white :: White would be the best because then the dog wouldnt be so hot the white had the least heat the whole time so it would nt get as hot as black, dark grey, or light gray.
white :: The white paint would keep the inside of the doghouse cool in the sun, because it reflects the most energy, therefore having the lowest internal temperature.
white :: White would be the best paint color for the d oghouse. In the experiment, the temperature in the jar for the white lid averaged 42(DEG) C. The black lid jar averaged a temperature of about 53 (DEG) C. The dark gray lid jar averaged 48(DEG) C, and the light gray l id jar averaged 45(DEG) C. The white lid jar was the coolest out of the four.
black :: It will be warmer inside of the dog house.
dark gray :: The best paint color for the doghouse would b e dark gray. In the experiment of the glass jar it had an average of 48(DEG) C and was the second highest temperature. The highest temperature was the black lid with 53(DEG)C. The difference of the highest temperature and second highest temperature was the 5(DEG)C. If using the dark gray paint color it would still absorb energy to keep the dogs warm, but yet be a bit coo l for them too.
white :: White, because it will keep the doghouse at a cool temperature (about 42 (DEG) C) in the summer when the dog is outside and needs a rest.
black :: this color would affect the dog house because the black would absorb energy from the sun and make the inside of the do g house hotter then the rest of the colors
light gray ::  With a light gray dog house the temperature i nside the house would be cool in the summer, but warm enough for th e dog in the winter. with this balance in temperature you dont have to wo rry about the dog being uncomfortable during any season.
dark gray ::  It didnt get any hotter or cooler, therefore it is the best paint color for the dog house because the dog would not be too cold, nor too hot.
light gray ::  light gray is more as cooler than black or dark gray in the summer but black and dark gray will be warmer in the winter light gray or white. Meaning light gray is in the middle.
white :: In the hot summer months the dog house won't get too hot.
black :: the darker the coler is the more hotter it is going to be in the inside and as in black what i picked it is going to w arm for the dog to sleep at night.
light gray :: because it stays at a liveable temp. of 45 de grees.
white :: If they paint the doghouse white then when th e dog goes inside it wont be so hot in there for him to sit in there.
dark gray :: the dark gray will keep the inside of the dog house warm enough in the winter and not to hot during the summer. the dar k gray was an average of 48(DEG)C which is not as hot as the black lid w hich was an average of 53(DEG)C and not as cold as the light gray which was and average of 45(DEG)C.
black :: The color may affect it by the temperature of the air may be cooler than the other colors
white :: the white color will attract less energy than the others, thus making the doghouse cooler
white ::  The color would affect the paint house becaus e. if it is a black colored house. it will be super dark. if it was a whi te color house it would be more lighter. during night time
light gray :: Because you dont want the dog house to be to cool or to warm.
white :: the color on the outside will either heat up or cool down the doghouse and since white was still warm but not too hot so white is the best color for the doghouse.
black :: the color might affect the dog house by attra cting the heat to it
light gray :: I would choose light gray because then the dog won't be too hot or too cold.This is why I would choose light gray to paint the dog house.
white :: this color will surely make the doghouse much cooler. I am not sure whether the question is asking which one will keep the dogg cool or hot, so i am choosing white. This color will keep the d og cool when it is hot and sunny. However, this color will not keep the dog warm in the winte r, so i am not sure.
white :: The color that might affect the doghouse is t he white beacuse it was the one that got less then the other three colors
light gray ::  Light gray would be the best choice, because you don't want the dog house to cold, but you dont want it to warm. And the average temperature for the light gray was 45(DEG)C which is just right for a dog, because you don't want your dog to get to hot. And the black wouldn't be a good color, because darker colors absorb more energy. And there was an eight degree difference between the black lid and the light grey lid, making the light grey lid, the cooler, better choice.
white :: White is a good choice because it will absorb less heat. The experiment shows that white is the least absorbant of heat, so it will keep the doghouse cooler.
white ::  Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse wh ite. This is because white doesn't attract as much heat. I know this beca use in the previous experiment the average temperature for the white lid was lowest at 42 degrees celsius. Using white paint will cause the dog to not be too hot.
dark gray ::  Dark gray will make the dog house a bit warme r. The data states that it is 48(DEG) C always.
white :: White reflects more sun, keeping the dog cool er in the summer heat.
light gray :: Light gray won't absorb too much sun in which case heating the interior, and it will absorb enough heat on cold days t o warm inside.
dark gray :: I choose light gray because it had an average temperature of 45 which is right in the middle of temperatures and the e ffect will be warm and cool at the same time. When you look at the table of the results from the experiment you will see that light gray had an av erage of 45 so that is perfect temperature because it will not get too ho t and it will not get too cold.
white :: I think white would be the best color to pain t the dog house. I say this because white absorbs less energy maki ng the dog house cooler. In the experiment, the white on average was 42(DEG) C, and that was the coolest temperature. The warmest temperature of the air in side the jar was the black with 53(DEG) C. For a dog inside a doghouse, i think it shouldn't be hot for the dog, that's why I chose the color tha t made the doghouse the coolest.
black :: the black wood paint would effect the tempera ture more becaasue the darker a color the more energy in attracts. so the black one would be hotter than the white one.
light gray :: if the color are ligth gray than the dog hous e the doghouse will be cooler becuz of tha gray and it also be warm cuz i t light...
white :: the dog house will not be to hot. the tempera ture will rise but it will not rise alot it will stay in cool for summer and they wouldnt have to worry about the dog house getting to hot. white is the one that stayed the coolest and the heat didnt rise alot it stayed about the same temperature the whole time.
black ::  In my oppinion, Brandi and Jerry would want t o paint the doghouse dark gray because it had an average temperature of 48(DEG)C which is the second hottest temperature out of the four lid colors. I think dark gray would be the logical color to paint a dog house because during harsh weather it will keep the dog warm, but during the summer it won't be to uncomfortably hot like black may be.
black ::  This color would help keep the inside of the doghouse warm because the data has proved this. This would help during wi nter.
white :: usually a dog house is only used in the summe r so to keep the dog a little less cooler they should use a white paint. bc i learned that all the colors bounce off white and go somewhere else a long with their heat. but blck has all the colors so it obsorbs all color s and their heat. so white would be best in the table it shows that the average temput ure for a white house is 42(DEG)c. the average temputure for lightgray i s 45(DEG)c, the average temp. for dark gray is 48(DEG)c, and black's av erage temp. is 53(DEG)c. thats an 11(DEG)c difference. whitch could be very important.
white :: The color would affect the doghouse because the lighter the color is the cooler the house would get. if the dog house was black then the doghouse would be too hot.
white :: The color will heat up the doghouse to about 42(DEG)C in 10 minutes. This is the best color to choose, because the bl ack heated up to 53(DEG)C in 10 minutes. Therefore, the temperature of t he white jar was 9(DEG)C lower than the black jar, making the white cool er.
light gray :: The doghouse should be light gray because tha t way the air temperature isn't to hot or to cold, it's just about in the middle.
white :: The color would affect the temperature inside the dog house. The black would make the temperature inside the greaterst then, the dark grey then, the light grey, then finally the white would h ave the lowest temperature just like the lid color. For the lid colors, b lack had an average of 53(DEG)C, the dark grey had an average of 48(DEG) C, the light grey would have an average of 45(DEG)C, aand the white had an ave rage of 42(DEG)C so the temperature for the dog house would be close or be to the same as the temperature of the jar.
white ::  Choosing the lightest shade (white) is the be st colour to paint a dog house because in order to create an environment most comfortable for the dog year round, the dog house must be capable of staying cool all summer. Painting the hosue white will ensure that it st ays as cool as it can over summer, thus making it the most comfortable fo r the dog. The white house will remain coolest because as according to th e data collected, the average temperature will be aprox. 42(DEG) C, whil e for the other colours they reached much greater temperatures (45(DEG) LGray, 48(DEG) DGray, 53(DEG) Black). The white colour was 11(DEG) coo ler than the darkest colour (black), thus making it the best colour to pa int a dog house.
dark gray ::  keep it cooler
light gray :: A light gray color could give you less heat i n the summer but during the winter when the the sun is out you could get some warmth. Since in the experiment the black lid would get the most hea t you woulnt want a dog to get to hot, but also not to cold.
black :: cAUSE HE MIGHT NOT WAMT TO SLEEP IN THE DOGHO USE CAUSE OF THE COLOR OF IT AND IT MIGHT ALSO MESS THE DOGS EYES UP TO T HAT COULD ALSO BE IT IN THIS EXPERIMENT
black :: It would make it really hot inside the doghou se because the color black attracks more heat, As aposed to colors that a re very bright like white or light gray or light green even.
black ::  painting the doghouse black might affect it b y attracting all the heat to it and might cause the dog to have a heat st roke while is laying inside.
black :: balck becuase balck goes with every thing
white ::  this is the best paint color for the dog hous e because in the experament it proved that the white matiral absorbed the least amount of heat therefore making the temp. in the jar the lea st
white :: i would choose white because it is one of the lightest colors. also in the experiment it was proven that white stayed the coldest after 10 minutes. therefore in the sun it should stay fairly cold fro the animal living in it.
black :: the dog house should be painted black because black absorbes heat. learned thin when the data table showed that the av erage tempature for black was 53(DEG)C. When the dogs out at night you w ould most likely want it to stay warm.
white :: because in the summer, the dog house wount ge t over heated because the average for the white lid in the hot lamp exper iment was 42(DEG)C and the black was 53(DEG)C.
light gray ::  The color chosen will affect the inside of th e doghouse because the color is a factor for the amount of air temperature it attracts. From the experiment, black attracted the most heat (or air temperature) with an average of 53(DEG)C, and dark gray had an average of 48(DEG)C, light gray had 45(DEG)C, and the color white with 42(DEG)C on average. Based on these results, i think light gray is the best paint color for a dog house since it still attracts a certain amount of heat, fewer than darker colors, but from the average air temperature in the glass jar from the experiment, the air inside the doghouse would be more withstandable than that of black paint or dark gray which would attract even more heat. Therefore, light gray colored paint would be the better option for a doghouse.
black ::  Has the most average.
black :: i think they should use a black for the dogho use because since we live in a generaly cold area and the black paint wou ld help keep the dog warm at night with the average temp of the air when the area is black is 53(DEG)c
light gray :: Light gray would keep the dog house a bit war mer without making it too hot like the black and dark gray would.
dark gray :: Dark grey is best because in the winter the d oghouse will absorbe heat. Also in the summer the doghouse will not absor be too much heat. like if it was black.
light gray :: It makes the doghouse a little cool but not t oo hot because on hot days it should be cool for the dog to go in there a nd rest. On colder days the dog should be able to go in there and still b e a little warm.
black :: it wold atracket heat or inorge frume t he sun
dark gray :: It will become light in there because if you have dark gray it will infect the color from the outside
light gray :: the house wouldnt get to hot for the dog and it wouldnt be too cold it would be in the middle
white :: .
black ::  I think black would be the best color for the doghouse. It will atract more heat inside the doghouse than any other color because in the experiment with the jars, the black lid jar had the warmest inside temperature. This black doghouse will heat up the inside of the doghouse for when it is cold out. When it is warm outside and the dog gets hot, it can sleep outside.
dark gray ::  it had a steady temperature, and for outside, it wouldnt be too hot or too cold if the roof was painted dark gray.
white :: If the doghouse was white, the inside of that doghouse would keep the temperature inside cool because, like in the experiment, the color white only got an average of 42(DEG)C. Unlike the col or black, which got an average temperature of 53(DEG)C.
white :: less heat will be attracted to it.
dark gray ::
light gray :: it will be warm for a dog that is meant to be outside and cool during summer
white :: I have chose the color white because it had t he least highest temperature. In the data from the previous experiment th e white lid had an average temperature of 42(DEG) making it the least ho ttest.
white ::  White would make dog house cooler i know this because when the lid color was white the average was 42(DEG)C compared to the average for black wich the average is 53(DEG)C.
black :: Black would be the best color, because it wou ld keep the house warmer. In the experiment, black produced the highest t emperature inside the jar (53(DEG)C)
light gray ::  It would absorb a little amount of heat for t he summer time when it's hot. But because it's also kind of dark it would keep some heat in for the winter. I know this because the black lid abso rbed the most heat and the white lid absorbed the least heat.
white :: becase it reflax the light
black :: black would kepp the dog house the warmest be cause of the averages of all the others were black 53 dark gray 48 light grey 45 and white 42
black ::  The dog house would be to hot since darker co lors absorb more energy.
black :: that color would affect the doghouse because it would be too dark in the inside and dogs dont have eye color so it wo uld be hard for the dog to see. it also takes way longer to dry then the other colors the other colors dryed in the 40's but the black color dryed in the 50 i would not recomend them to color it black
light gray :: In the summer it will not abosrb much heat ke eping the dog cool yet in the winter it will still contain a decent amoun t of heat keeping the dog at least fairly warm.
black ::  The color would affect the dog house because the darkness will help the dog go to sleep better durning the day. Also i t will affect it because the darker the color the greater the incre ase in air temperature in the doghouse.It will also affect it because the darker colors absorb more energy.
black :: Black is the best color for the doghouse in o rder to keep the dgohouse warm. brandi and Jerry's data showed that the d arker the lid (or in this case, doghouse) the darker the color, the more increase in air temperature. Which in the lid experiment, the data showed that black on average had the highest data of 53(DEG)C while others lik e dark gray and light gray had averages of 48(DEG) and 45(DEG) C.
dark gray :: the dark gray will affect the temperature of the doghouse just enough that the animal that's living in it wont freeze or overheat, because the dark gray color in the experiment didn't collect as much heat in the experiment as the black so it wont overheat the the animal and it collect more heat than white or light gray so the opposite effect wont take place.
light gray :: Light gray would keep the temperature in the summer down so the dog wont over heat. Black Dark gray would be to hot in the summer the dog would over heat, White would be to cold in the winter and summer the dog would freeze. That is why Light gray would be perfect for the dog house color.
white :: i would choose white because it would make th e inside of the doghouse cooler than a dark color so the dog wouldn't hav e to be super hot in the sun. the average temperature for white was 42(DEG) after ten minutes and it was 53(DEG) for black showing that black makes it ho tter inside.
light gray ::  Light gray will affect the doghouse by keepin g it cooler than it would with black paint, but warmer than it would with white. In warmer tempatures, the paint will not asborb as much sunlight, so therefore the inside of the doghouse will not be as hot. The black paint had an average tempature of 53(DEG) C, while the light gray had an average tempature of 45(DEG)C. That is a difference of 8(DEG)C. The light gray will keep the doghouse cooler, but it will also keep it a little bit warmer than white paint. The white paint had a n average tempature of 42(DEG)C. The light gray paint would keep t he doghouse 3(DEG)C warmer then the white paint, but 8(DEG)C cooler tha n the black paint.
white :: white will bring more light in the dog house because it is a light color and it attracts light and it will bring more in
black :: black because it well make the dog hous e warmer and the results to the black colr is saying it warmer.
light gray :: the doghouse would be cooler in the summer an d not as cold in the winter the light gray lid was cooler than the black lid which would make it better for useing in a hot environment. the most comfortable color varies with the kind of environment and i am assu ming this is a rather warm environment.
white ::  The best answer would be white because white is a light color that won't absorb heat and dehydrate the dog during the summer. When Brandi and Jerry performed their experiment they found that when a jar had a black lid on it, the temperature inside the jar was an a verage of 53(DEG)C. Whereas, when there was a white lid on the jar the a veraage temperature was 42(DEG) C. That is an 11(DEG) differance. There for the best choice would be to paint the doghouse white.
white ::  how the white might affect the doghouse is be cause it will be alot cooler than the other dark colors because the avera ge temperature of the darker colors are more then whites
white :: It might not give it much light from the sun or any heat because darker colors attract more energy and light. Just lik e with the jars and the lamp. The jar with a black lid had the highest av erage, therefore proving that darker colors attract more energy.
white :: painting the doghouse white will reflect the sunlight making it cooler in there
black :: Well, darker colors absob more heat than ligh ter energy, so if you paint the doghouse black than the inside of the dog house will be warmer than the inside of a white painted doghouse. When Br andi and Jerry used a black lid (dark color) for the experiment the resul ts were in the low 50's range, 52-54 (DEG)C. but when they used the whit e lid (light color) the results were in the low 40's range, 41-43 (DEG)C .
light gray ::  in the summer the dog house will not be hot
dark gray :: The dark gray wil affect the dog house becaus e no matter what color the doghoue is, the room will still be dark.
dark gray ::  the dog house will be warm during winter so t hat the dog will warm and cofortable
white ::  this color will help the dog house cool becau se it is the clor that remained the coolest during the experiment.
light gray :: I would go with light gray because in the exp eriment it was at a good temperature of 45(DEG)F, Black was to hot at a temperature of 53 (DEG)F, Dark gray was a little to warm at a temerature of 48(DEG)F, And white was a little to cold at a temerature of 42(DEG) F.
"black ::  If Brandi and Jerry were to paint a dog house the color they should choose is black, because its the darkest color so it absorbs the most thermal heat. My theory is correct because in Bradi a nd Jerry's hypothesis ""the darker the lid color, the greater the inc rease is air temperature in the glass jar, because darker color absorbs m ore energy""."
white :: Using the color white to paint the dog house would make the dog house be the lowest increase in air temperature then t he other colors. The dog house started at 24 degrees for each trial. The dog house would be about 42 degrees and I know that because the first trial was 42 degrees, the second trial was 43 degrees and the third trial was 41 degress. The average temperature is 42 degrees so there fore white is the best color to use.
white :: it would make the doghouse cooler inside
white :: If you paint the doghouse white, it will be c ooler inside than if you painted it black. Since black absorbs more energ y it will get hotter faster than if it was painted white.
white :: They should use white because in the other ex priment white was the coolist, so if they use white it will not get to ho t in the dog house.
light gray :: The color of the dog house should be light gr ay because it doesn't absorb as much energy as black and dark gray which had the temperatures of 53(DEG)c and 48(DEG)c in the experiment, so the dog won't feel very hot either and since dogs are always jumping around, they probably already are hot enough. Also if it does get cold, light gr ay will still absorb enough energy to keep the dog warm becuase it's temp erature was 48(DEG)c which is only 2(DEG)c less than dark gray, so i th ink light gray will be the best color for the dog house.
black :: Because the lighter one top put on the doghouse is the white not the black because it a difference of nine.
light gray :: The color white might affect the doghouse, be cause the air temperature on the inside would be a lot cooler, but not to o cold and at the same time not too hot. When the lid color of the glass jar was black, the average air temperatuire was 53(DEG)C, after only 10 minutes, when the starting temperature was 24(DEG)C, which I believe mig ht be too hot for a dog living in a black doghouse. When their was a whit e lid, the average temperature after the same amount of time, and startin g at the same temperature of 24(DEG)C, was 42(DEG)C, which I believe wo uld be too cold for a dog living in a white doghouse. I believe the light gray lid air temperature was niether too hot, nor too cold, because afte r 10 minutes and a starting temperature of also 24(DEG)C, it's average a ir temperature inside was 45(DEG)C.
white ::  white is the best color for the doghouse beca use lighter colors absorb less energy, which is shown on the data chart. it has an average tempature of 41(DEG)C versus the black lid which has a n average tempature of 53(DEG)C.
dark gray :: dark grey would be good because it wont get t o hot or to cold for the dog because the average temp for dark grey was 4 8(DEG)c
light gray :: it will cool and heat up the dog house
white ::  it will make it less hotter for the dog
black :: if it was color black it would make the dog h ouse hot.
white :: White would make it cooler inside for the dog , Because it would reflect more heat instead of taking it in. Also, it wa s cooler inside because white's average was the lowest (42(DEG)) .
white :: I think they should paint the color white, be cause white absorbs less heat than black does. Because if Black, Dark gra y, or Light gray were to be painted on the doghouse, that would absorb mo re heat than white would.
black ::  If you paint the doghouse black, the inside o f the doghouse would be warmer than if you painted the doghouse a lighter colour such as light grey or white.
white :: White paint will make the doghouse less hot, because it attracts less energy from the sun.
white :: White would be the best color to paint a dog house, because the light color soaks in less light than darker colors. Br andi and Jerry's experiment found that a jar with a black lid was 53(DEG) C after ten minutes, but a jar with a white lid was only 42(DEG)C.
white ::  the doghouse will be warm when the sun hits i t but it won't be so hot and it will be closer to room temperature for th e dog.
black ::  when the jar had a black lid the average temperature after 10 minute was 53(DEG), when the lid was white the average ttemperature was 42(DEG) because the black lid made the jar warmer the doghouse's roof should be painted black to keep the inside of the dog house and the dog warmer.
black :: Now the doghouse can be warm in the winter, b ecause 'dark colors absorb more light', and then the dog can just play ar ound in the yard in summer because everyone usually enjoys sun, even dogs .
black ::  By painting the doghouse black, the air insid e the doghouse will be warmer than if the doghouse was another color. In the experiment, the air from the jar with the black colored lid was 53(DEG) , which is 2(DEG) higher than the dark grey lid, 8(DEG) higher than the light grey lid, and 11(DEG) higher than the white lids air temperature. This shows that the black paint would make the doghouse warmer than the other colored paint would make it.
white :: it wpuld make it less hot by having white bec ause white is a light color and does not coduct that much heat as have bi n shown by brandi and jerry the results were that white had the lowest av erage at 42(DEG) c
black :: I choose the color black because it keeps in more light and it has hotter temperature. All the others had lower temper atures and the black was the highest temperature.
dark gray :: dark gray may attract more heat to the dog ho use but no as much as black.
dark gray :: The best color for the doghouse is dark gray because it won't be so dark that it will overheat the inside of the dogho use and it will also retain it's temperature longer through out the night . The dark grey average temperature after 10 minutes was 48(DEG). That i s better than the 53(DEG) average for the black and the 45(DEG) a verage for light gray because it will not be way too warm but it will ret ain it's heat.
black :: The color black would effect the inside of th e doghouse because darker colors absorb more heat, keeping the dog warm. As in the experiment, while the black lid was over the thermometer and th e light was 5 centimeters away, the temperature on the thermometer increa sed by 29(DEG) C.
dark gray :: doghouse will not to hot or cold in summer an d winter
light gray :: Light gray would work best because then insid e the dog house it would still be warmer than outside, but when it was ho t outside it would not be too much hotter inside opposed to if the dog ho use was painted black.
black ::  With the color black as the dog house the ins ide temperature will be much hotter than the temperatures of the other co lors because the average temperature for black on the experiment wa s 53(DEG)C, for dark gray ave. temp. was 48(DEG)C, for light gray it wa s 45(DEG)C ave. temp., and for the white lid the ave. temp. was 42(DEG) C. controlled varible: temp. in jar before starting exp. responding:air temp. inside jar after 10 min. uder lamp manipulated: lid color
black :: the black color absorbs more energy so when i ts cold outside the inside can heat up by the sun
black ::  if the dog house is black it will increase th e tempeture of the air inside the dog house, making it warmer inside it.
light gray :: it will keep it not to hot and not to cold be couse of the coler that its not to dark adn not to light so it will keep it ice andf cool not to hot or not to cold
white ::  the reason they should pick white is because it will cool down the tempature in the dog house the reason I know that i s in the data they did for the experiment it tells you that white is cool er than the rest of the colors
black :: if a dog house was painted black, then the do g house would stay warmer inside because the experiment shows that the ai r temprature in a glass jar with a black lid on it had the warmest air te mprature of 53, 54, and 52.
white :: This color will keep the dog house rather coo l that way the dog will not over heat itself. In the experiment, lighter colors absorbed less light and were cooler in temperature.
light gray :: The light gray color might affect the inside of the doghouse because if it isnt to dark or to light the inside wont be to hot or to cold. This is because dark colors absorb more energy and light colors reflected energy. The light gray was about in the middle with 45(DEG)c so i thought it was the best choice for the dog.
white :: White will be the best color for the doghouse because the white lid kept the jar coolest, meaning that white paint wil l keep the doghouse coolest because it reflects more energy than any of t he other colors. the white lid kept the jar an average of three deg rees celcius cooler than any other color.
white :: If Brandi and Jerry dont want the dog to get to hot then they would want to pick white because it does not increase th e air temperature as much as black
black :: I think black would beb best to use for the d oghouse because on winter nights when it gets cold out, the black color o f the doghouse will keep it warmer. Since darker colors absorb more energ y than lighter colors. Black was 53(DEG)C after 10 minutes, while white was 42(DEG)C that is a change of 11(DEG)C warmer then the other.
dark gray :: This color will keep the doghouse warm since it will probably be outside and it won't be to hot either.
dark gray :: The dark grey would keep the doghouse warm, b ut not too hot. This is shown in the experiment when dark grey was the se cond warmest color.
dark gray :: the color of the dog house will cang the air pressure in side
dark gray ::  I believe that dark gray would be the best pa int color for the dog house. Although the temperature inside the do house would be warmer, it would not be super warm and make the dog overheat. A lso, the air wouldn't be too cold that the dog would freeze at night when he sleeps in it. Considering that dark gray had an average of 48(DEG) inside, it appears perfect compared to the white with an average of 42(DEG) and the black with an average of 53(DEG).
dark gray :: Dark gray would be best to build a doghouse b ecause it the temperture stays the same every single time, which means if its cold the temperture stays the same. If its hot, the temperture stays the same and doesnt get to hot.
white :: White would cause the inside of the doghouse to not be so hot on the inside so the dog can stay cooler because with th e white lid, the inside of the jar was the coldest out of all the other j ars.
dark gray :: The tempeture inside the dog house will be wa rm.
white ::  They should use the white color because white doesn't heat up as fast. After 10 minutes, white's tempature was 42(DEG) while black's was 53(DEG). That is an 11(DEG) difference. So the dogho use will stay cooler if the doghouse is painted white.
white :: The color white is best for the doghouse beca use the experiment was on the effect of different lid colors on the air t empurature inside a class jar so looking at the chart the color white h ad an average of 42(DEG)C which means that the increase of air was coole r . So the color white will affect the doghouse by the increase of air fl ow and be cooler then any other color.
white ::  The white dog house would not attract as much heat as the darker colors, so if they want to keep their dog at a cool t emperature, then they should go with the white color. The average tempera ture for the black colored jar is 53(DEG) C. The average temperature for the white colored jar is 42(DEG) C. The black lided jar is 11(DEG) C h igher than the white lided jar.
black :: it will usually always be 53(DEG) C in the dog house because that is the average tempature.
light gray ::  The temperature of the doghouse with a light gray paint coating on it would make the doghouse warm but not cold or hot of a temperature of around 45(DEG)Celsius.
light gray ::  the dog will might sleep on the doghouse.
white :: The white attracted the least heat than any o f the other colors. The white Low data for white was 41(DEG) and the hig h data was 43(DEG).
white :: the white would keep the dog house nice and c ool in the experiment white attracted the least heat. example the average heat was 42 for the white and 53 for the black.
white ::  painting a dog house white will keep it coole r than other colors. in the experiment white had an average temp of 42(DEG) C while black had a 53(DEG)C average
white ::  White would be the best color to paint the do g house. In the experiment white didnt absorb that much heat, stayi ng at a temperature of around 42(DEG). This would mean that the dog hous e would stay a cool temperature for the dog.
white :: The white paint will be the coolest paint cho ice for the doghouse. In the data Brandi and Jerry collected, white had t he lowest temperature average of 42(DEG)C. The next coolest was light gr ey with an average of 45(DEG)C, dark grey with an average of 48(DEG)C a nd the hottest was black with an average of 53(DEG)C. Therefore white pa int will make the doghouse the coolest.
black :: Since black absorbs more light than the dark gray, light gray, and white, it will make the doghouse warmer. This will help because in the winter when he needs the doghouse the most, it will k eep him warm when he is inside of it.
white :: White would be the best paint color for the d og house because on a hot day the dog wont get as hot. This is because f rom the results it was that white paint got as high as 43 and black got a s hot as 54
light gray :: Light gray would affect the doghouse by keepi ng it slightly warmer in the winter, and cool in the summer.
white ::  It would keep the doghouse cooler, especiall y in summer months when there are high temperatures outside (ex: in the experiment the average temperature of white was 42(DEG), the coolest temperature of them all) . This would allow the dog to get to a cooler place to avoid overheating.
white :: If the dog house is white, then it will be co oler. Since the white lid made the inside of the jar 42(DEG)c, and the b lack lid made the inside of the jar 53(DEG)c then we know that white wil l make the doghouse cooler.
black :: by making the doghouse black it would absorve heat energy that will make the doghouse warmer than if it was a lighter color.
white :: White would affecvt the doghouse by making it cooler and not so hot. This is because in the experiment the black absor bed the heat so it would be hotter so making it white according to the da ta will make the doghouse cooler
white :: White would make it more comfortable for the dog and it would be warmer than black because the black absorbs more ener gy than light colors.
white :: If the doghouse was painted white, then the a ir temperature inside wouldn't change very much. It would be cooler.
black :: The inside of the doghouse would most likely be the hottest beacuse the black absorbs the sunlight, therefore it would become hot on the inside. Results from the experiment are that the black lid had a high of 54 degrees celcius and that is higher than the rest of the colors.
dark gray :: According to the results that they got this c olor remained constant throught all 4 trials. This means that if they use this to color the doghouse the dog wont get to hot or too cold but it wi ll remain a average temperature of 48(DEG)
white :: decrease the tepmpature
white ::  hite will keep the doghouse cooler inside bec uase white attracks less energy than black, dark grey, and light grey. th e white was the lowest average tempatue a 42(DEG)C
white ::  If they paint it white then the doghouse wont absorb much heat.In the experiment the average temperature in a white li d jar was 42(DEG) C
light gray ::  the dog might not be able to see it in the ni ght.
light gray ::  If it was black and it was summer, the dog wo uld be hot. And if it was white and it was winter the dog would freeze. S o light gray would be the best color for the dog. If the tempature was 24 (DEG) outside and the dog was cold, he could go in his dog house and it would be around 45(DEG) degrees in his dog house. So he wont freeze as m uch as he would as if he was outside.
white ::  The black paint made the air in the jar 53 degrees while the white paint was only 42 degrees. The white paint woud be best for the doghouse because it would keep the doghouse cooler if it was hot outside.
black :: This color might affect the doghouse, because when the sun shines the sun in black then the temperature will ri se from the dog house and making the doghouse hot.
white :: White will keep the doghouse the coolest beca use the other colors got tempatures of 53(DEG)C, 48(DEG)C, and 45(DEG) C, but the white jar got 42(DEG)C.
white :: this would make the dog house cool in the summer because in the experiment the white lid jar had th coldest temperature of 41(DEG) C.
dark gray ::  The doghouse wouldn't be too cold or too hot, it would be right in the middle. Black, which is 53 C (average) would be a little too hot and white, which is 42C would be too cold, so the one i m the middle which is dark gray would be the best paint color for the dog house.
white ::  the white might let sunlight come in the dog house
black :: Black will affect the dog house because when is sunny and bright the color will attract the heat and it will make it e ven hotter in the out side and the inside of the dog house
white :: white is best for the dog house because if it was black the dog house would get hot
black ::  Black will affect the doghouse because dark c olors absorb more energy.
white ::  By choosing the color white, Brandi and Jerry 's doghouse would be colder than if they chose any of the other color opt ions. In the experiment, the average temperature for black lid was 53(DEG) c, for dark gray 48(DEG)c, for light gray 45(DEG)c, and finally for white 42(DEG) c. Which means that the white doghouse would be colder than any of the other color options.
light gray :: I chose the color light gray.Light gray would make the dog house around 45(DEG) C average on the inside. The results show that light gray was an average of 45(DEG) C and black was an averag e of 53(DEG)C. White was an average of 42(DEG) C. Light gray is 3 degre es warmer then white and 8 degrees cooler then black. Light gray is a col or in between the temperatures, leaving the dog house not to hot or not t o cold.
light gray :: Would make it warm in winter and not boiling hot in summer.
black :: The other colors had between 40(DEG) and 50(DEG) but black is hotter then the other colors.
light gray ::  Black could turn the inside of the dog house to hot for a dog to be in it so i choose light gray because the heat it a ttracts will make the inside nice and warmin ten minuets it would only be 45(DEG) compared to the black were in ten minetus it would be53(DEG) w hich would clearly be to hot for a dog.
white :: White, because white reflects the sun and the doghouse wont get hot like it would if you use black. In your data it sh ows that in the trials white will be the least hot color.
dark gray :: I chose dark gray because the darker the colo r, the more heat it attracts. For example, during the winter, the dog ins ide the doghouse might get cold, so the sun shinning on the doghouse will absorb the heat and let the heat inside. But sometimes the dog might not want so much heat, so i picked dark gray instead of black. Also, another example is in the summer time, if the dog doesnt want to go outside, and stays in the doghouse, he doesnt have to be so hot. But he can also go o utside if the doghouse is to warm.
black ::  black because then in the winter when its get s cold whatever sunlight there is it will obsoub the heat and make it sli ghtly warmer
white :: using white paint would keep the temperature inside of the doghouse low on a sunny day. the average temperature of the white lid was 42(DEG)C and the average temperature of the blace lid was 53(DEG)C, the white lid was 11(DEG)C cooler then the jar with the blac k lid
light gray ::  it will keep it warm for those cold night an d keep it cool for those hot summer days.
black :: Using a black paint color for the doghouse wi ll make the doghouse nice and warm for a dog during the cold seasons when a doghouse is needed the most. Due to the data, a black lid color had an average of 53(DEG)C. That will affect the doghouse by making the doghou se much more warmer in temperature. A white lid only had an average of 42 (DEG)C, making it too cold for the dog. That's why a black doghouse is b est for a doghouse to keep the dog warm.
white ::  White would be the best paint color because it doesnt attract as much heat as black, light gray, or dark gray because its the lightest color. This is good because in the summer, if the dog house attracted a lot of heat, the dog could over heat and get sick. The black lid got the hottest air temperature, having an average of 53(DEG)C, dark gray was the second hottest, having an average air temperature of 48(DEG)C, light gray had the second coolest air temperature, on average being 45(DEG)C, and white had the lowest air temperature with an average of 42(DEG)C. These results show that the white lid attracted the least amount of heat, and is therefore why I believe that a white dog house would be best.
dark gray :: The Dog house will be warm but it will probab ly always stay around the same temperature because in the trial Dark Gray was always 48 degrees celcius
light gray :: Light gray would not affect that much in the inside of the house because when it's warm the dog would not be too hot a nd when it's too cold the dog would still be able to be warm. As you can see in the data collected if they choose black color to paint the doghous e &amp; it was hot the dog which could harm the dog, and if it they painted it white around winter the dog would be freezing, so I believe t hat light gray would be perfect because it doesnt affect the inside of th e doghouse as much as the other colors.
white ::  i would say black because it exsord bes heat to make it worm inside. And th ey said the dark the color the greater the air temputure in the glass jar
white :: If you paint it white the doghouse will be co oler in the hot summer sun. In the experiment the average temperature for the white lid was 42(DEG) but it was 53(DEG) for the black lid. You pr obably don't want your dog to over heat so you would paint it white.
dark gray :: It will keep the doghouse's interior at an av erage temperature
white :: White would affect the inside of the doghouse becuase it is a light color so it will absorb less enrgy becuase the dar ker the color the more enrgy it will absorb. In teh data table from their experiment, black absorbed the most energy and white absorbed the least energy so that is why they should choose white for the doghouse
black :: the best paint color for the dog house would be black because the darker the doghouse the grater chance it will have o ut in the sun
white :: The best color would be white because white had an average temperature of 42(DEG)c compared to the other temperatures. White would keep the doghouse the coolest temperature possible.
black :: Black Will Efect The Dog House Alot In The Su mmer Because Balck Is An Energy Color.
white ::  This color will affect the doghouse by making it colder. If they live in a hot place this would be the best color to c hoose from.
white :: i think that brandi and jerry should paint th e doghouse white. i believe that white would be the best color because in the results it shows that white collects less heat and energy. that wpul d be good because if it was sunny and the dog wanted to go somewhere cool he would have his white dog house that doesnt suck in all of the heat.
dark gray ::  The best paint color for the dog house would be dark gray because it will wont get to hot or to cold in the dog house for the dog. I know this because in the results the light gray lid only made the jar an average of 48 degrees C after 10 minutes of being under the lamp.
light gray ::  Light gray will keep the doghouse cooler that black because lighter colors reflect more light than darker colors. Dark colors do not reflect light well, instead they absorb it causing higher temparatures. In winter light gray will keep the doghouse slighty warmer than white would and it will keep the doghouse cooler in the summer.
light gray :: it will heat the doghouse up just enough to b e the perfect temperature.
light gray ::  On hot sunny days the color of the house wouldn't absorb so much heat, So the house woldnt get so hot, But if it was a cold day the colors of the house could reflect the cold air, Becuas e, Lighter colors reflect heat, &amp; darker colors absorb heat.
light gray :: because the dog might be jumpy and get mud paw prints on the house
black :: The paint color will help to keep the dog war m becuse in the results of the experiment the black lid heated up faster.
white ::  The Best color would be white because as show n in the table white absorbs less heat energy and therefore stays cooler so that means the dog would stay cooler.
white :: The color white might affect the doghouse by making it cooler. I know this because the temperature for the air in the glass jar with the black lid was warmer then the white lid.
black :: In the experiment the black lid on the jar he ld the most heat so if you colored the doghouse black the temperature ins ide the doghouse would stay at a higher constant temperature. The black l id had the highest average temperature of 53(DEG)C, dark gray had an ave rage temperature of 48(DEG)C, light gray had an average of 45(DEG)C and white had the lowest temperature with 42(DEG)C
white :: White would reflect more heat and keep the dog from baking in the summer. the average temperature of the white-lid-jar was 42(DEG), while the averge temperature of the black-lid-jar was 53(DEG). the white was 11(DEG) cooler, so if the doghouse was white that shoud stop the dog from being fried in the summer.
dark gray :: If Brandi and Jerry painted the doghouse dark gray, I think it would be just warm enough in the winter and just cool e nough in the summer, because dark gray has the medium-warm temperature on the chart about the colored lids.
dark gray :: I chose dark gray cause it will be warm for the dogs in the winter, and cool in the summer.
white ::  in the experament the color white absorbed less heat. so if you want your dog to stay cool you should pick white that way he or she isnt as hot.
dark gray :: easy to light make stay drak
white :: The purpose of a dog house is to have a place where a dog could get out of the sun or rain. White is a good choice bec ause it let the least amount of heat into the jar. The tempature of the w hite jar was an average of 11(DEG) C less than the tempature of bla ck jar.
white ::  it will be cooler inside
white ::  This color will cool down the dog house. The results show that on every trial the whites temperature was lower than al l other colors in the expirement.
light gray ::  I think light gray paint would work best to paint the dog house because in the summer black would be way to hot for the dog. The dog would feel most comfertable in a light colerd house in t he summer so that it is a comfertable tempuature. But in the winnter white would be to cold and the dog would freeze. The dog would want to be warm in the winter. In the expirament the black heated to 53(DEG)C an d the white heated to 42(DEG)C witch is a difference of 11(DEG)C. That is why the dog house should be light gray insted of black, white or dark gray.
white ::  Painting the doghouse white would keep the temperature cooler inside the dog house. The jarm with the white lid had the coolest temperature inside the jar. The darker the color of the lid got, the warmer the inside of the jar was.
white ::  i think white because had the less average in side the glass. the reason i didnt pick the other colors is because it is gonna be to dark so therfore you couldnt see anything t night so t heir i would pick white because u can see them better
black :: black might affect the doghouse because its going to be dark,hot, and not cmfortable.
white :: I chose white because the white paint color d oesn't abosorb that much energy than the other colors and also the air te mperature inside wouldn't be as high as the other colors. So if the white doghouse was placed under the sun and the starting temperature would be 24(DEG)C the average temperature would only rise up to 42(DEG)C. But if the color of the doghouse was black or gray than the temperature would b e in the 45(DEG)C - 53(DEG)C. So white doghouse would be a great pick f or the color of the doghouse.
light gray :: I picked Light gray because in the winter he can be warm and in the summer cool. This, color means that we wouldnt be hot on the summer and cold in the winter.
black :: Black will make the doghouse to hot. The dog will not go in the doghouse because the dog will not feel comfortable. I n the lab, the black got way more heat then the others colors that were u sed.
white :: white doesnt take in colors from the rainbow like black and other colors
black :: Black absorbs heat therefore it would make th e dog house warmer than all of the other colors. This can be supported be cause in the expirement black got up to 53(DEG)C and the white only got up to 42(DEG)C. Black was the warmest
light gray ::  light gray would be best because it wouldnt b e not to hot and not to cold.
dark gray :: Dark gray because it wouldn't be to hot and it wouldn't be to cold.
black :: black will keep the dog warm but if you live in a hot area than white
light gray :: the dog house color should be light gray beca use in the lid experiment the hottest color was black and the coolest col or was white .i chose light gray because you dont want the dog to be to c old in the dog house because in thelid experiment the coldest lid w as the white lid and the average temperature for that lid was 42(DEG)!so i though is stead of having the dog house that cold why not have it ligh t gray because the average temperature for the light gray lid turned out to be 45(DEG)
white ::  it should be white because in the experiment, the white lid had the lowest air tempeture. you dont want your dog tog e t to hot during the summer.
white ::  the color white would be good for the doghous e becuase it is the color that does not atract heat so the inside of the doghouse wont be hot. in the experiment the color white was the lowest te mpeture out of the other colors so it would be the best color for the dog house.
white :: I chose white because the white was the coole st in all 4 trials. The white coloring repelled the heat of the lamp keep ing it cool. On hot days the dog would stay cool.
white :: if they pick white then the dog will be more cold than if they picked black this is because the darker colors like bla ck and gray take in more heat and energy and if they pick white it takes in less heat and energy so therefor Brandi and Jerry should pick a dark c olor
light gray :: If you paint the inside of the doghouse light gray it would affect the temp. of the inside of the doghouse.It would ke ep it warm inside if it was cold outside.
black ::  It might affect the doghouse because it obesv ers heat energy with a darker color.
white ::  White paint would make the dog house cooler b ecause white paint reflects light.
light gray :: I chose light gray because that way the dogho use could stay cool and the dog wouldn't be too hot. Black was an average of 53, and Light gray was 45. So its a just right roof.
black :: black absorbs more heat from the sun this is good beacuse in the winter the dog will be very warm insidebut durning th e hot summer ddays the dog probly wont use it so black would be the best option
white :: white can reflect more heat then black becaus e black absorbs more heat
white :: White would be the best color for the dog hou se because in the experiment the data in the chart shows that white kept the coolest temperature of 41(DEG)C, light gray had the second coolest t emperaturee of 44(DEG)C, dark gray had the second hottest temperature of 48(DEG)C, and black had the hottest temperature of 54(DEG)C.
white ::  the color white would be a good color for a d og house because from the data it says that the average temperature was 4 2(DEG) in side the jar thats only went up 18(DEG)
light gray :: the color light gray will heat the dog house but it wont over heat it and it will not under heat it either.
black :: Blacvk will affect the doghouse becuase It wi ll make it warmer for the dog to like in.
light gray :: I would chose light gray because on a cold da y, any heat you be absorbed into the doghouse and the dog wouldnt be that cold but on a hotter day, the gray wouldnt let in so much heat the the dog would be to hot.
black :: it will make the dog house warmer than any of the other colors because in the experiment the black lid had the warmest effect on the glass jar os it would most likely have the warmest effect on the dog house
black ::  dark grey keeps a consistant heat level so it will not get super hot or cold in hot and cold seasons. this will keep a dog more comfortable.
dark gray ::  -they should use the dark gray beause they want the dog house warm for the winter and the nights but not to warm because of summer, if they use the dark gray then the dog house stays warm for the winter and not too hot for the summer. - this color will affect the inside because it is a darker color but it is not too dark the dark gray willkeep the dog house warm and cozy for the dog but not to warm for the summer. -the dark gray kept the jar at a tempature of 48(DEG), the black kept it at 53(DEG), the light gray kept it at 45(DEG), and the white kept it at 42(DEG). thease results show that if they used black the dog hose would get to hot. if they used the white the dog house would be too cold. the dark gray would keep the house at a warm tempature for the dog.
white :: The color white would effect the dog house by making it cooler inside.
light gray ::  That color would effect the dog house because when the sun was up it would maintain 44(DEG)-46(DEG)c. That would keep the dog comfortable while the sun was out.
white :: The color white might affect the doghouse bec ause since white is a very light color it does not absorb light as well a dark color would.The dark color would not only absorb the light but woul d also create heat energy.From the results in the experiment white was th e color that I had chhosen because the air in the glass jar did not get n ear as hot as all the others.Also picking the color that didnt create as much heat as all the others is the best to choose because then the dog st ays cool.
white ::  It would not affect the doghouse to much beca use it absorbs less heat then the other colors and that allows the doghou se to not get to hot.
dark gray :: Dark gray will make the dog house absorb alot of energy but not as much as black because in the experiment it averaged at 48(DEG)c and black averaged at 53(DEG)c.
white ::  white has less energy absorbed so it will coo l down better than black would.
white :: they should paint the dog house white because its is a light color and attracts less heat the black lid got the highest tempature showing they should not use black pain because it attra cts heat
white :: this color will affect the doghouse by making it cooler on the inside because in the air temperature data, Brandi and Jerry figured out that white colors didnt attract much heat because compa red to the black to white lid, the black lid was 11(DEG)C more hot than the white lid.
white ::  White would be a good color for the doghouse because it doesnt absorb as much energy as the other colors. This means that the temperature inside the doghouse wont be as hot. In the scenario, the temperature of the air for the white lid was 42(DEG)C and the temperatures of the Black,Dark gray and Light gray lids were 53(DEG)C, 48(DEG) C and 45(DEG)C. This information shows that the white lid had a lower temperat ure than the other three lids.
white :: If the dog house was white the inside would b e cooler then the rest of the colors. In the experiment the white lid was 11 degrees cooler then the black.
white :: i would paint it white, that way, showing fro m the table, the tempurature wouldnt get so hot.
light gray ::  The color light gray would be the best paint for the doghouse. During the experiment, light grey had an average of 48(DEG)c, compared to black whos average was 53(DEG)c and white whos was 42(DEG)c. Light grey would affect the doghouse becasue it is a color that soaks up heat but not so much that it would overheat the doghouse.
white :: so it dosent get hot in the house
white ::  The dog house will remain cooler in the summe r. The white lid only had an average of 42(DEG)C in the jar, while the black lid had an average of 53(DEG)C in the jar.
dark gray :: This color would keep the doghouse warmer dur ing the winter and hotter during the summer. Therefore, this would be a g ood paint color for the doghouse. I know this because in the experiment t hey did, the air tempeture in the dark gray colored lid inside the jar wa s around 45(DEG), while the darkest colored lid was hotter, and the ligh test was cooler.
white :: Because the lighter the doghouse is the coole r it is in the sun.
white ::  If Brandi and Jerry chose white as the color for their doghouse, then it'll affect the temperature by it being much cooler inside, rather than a black or dark gray color which would make it much warmer.
white ::  White will attract a less amount of heat to t he doghouse. It is the best paint color because it will provide shelter f or the dog from the sun and provide a cooler environment.
white ::  if they used white for the color of the dog hous it would keep the inside of it cool because white reflects ligh t.
dark gray ::  I choose dark gray because the color will not make the doghouse too cold and not too hot. The results showed that the highest temputure was 48(DEG)C and the lowerest was 48(DEG)C.
light gray ::  I would chose light gray because from all the colors it isn't the least amount of air temperature and it isn't the gre atest. So, I believe that its just right for the dog because it won't suf ficate or it wont have to much. The first trial for the light greyt was 4 4(DEG)C and the temperature just went up by one which makes it 45(DEG)C and the third trial it also went up by one 46(DEG)C. This makes the hou se very predictable about what the temperature is going to be.
white :: A white doghouse would make the inside of tha t doghouse cooler in the summer, but it wouldnt make it as warm in the wi nter, since in the expirament the white lid captured less light than any other color of lid.
dark gray :: This color will make the temperature in the d og house will cause the dog house to stay cool but also collect heat. In the experiment the dark gray got up to 48(DEG)c .
black :: Black will make the doghouse warmer than the other colors because it got an average of 53 while the other colors got i n the 40's.
black :: Black might affect the doghouse because this color will heat the dog house the most. Black, based on the experim ent, was able to absorb the most light energy out of all the colored lids . For example, in trial 1, black had a termperature of 52 degrees c elcius compared to dark gray which was 48 degrees celcius. Light gr ay had 44 degrees celcius and white had 42 degrees celcius. Evident ly, black will keep the doghouse most warm compared to the other three co lors.
white :: White becase the doghouse wont get to hot for the dog and the temurature will be at a low risk for the dog to get heat stroke.
light gray ::  Light gray is a good choice because it keeps the doghouse cool on a hot day but it will keep some heat on cooler days.
black ::  This color will make the doghouse absorb more light. Because it is black, heat will absorb on this faster then dark gr ay, light gray, or white.
white ::  If they use white the doghouse will be cooler than if they used black because the average temperature inside the jar w as 42(DEG)C for a white lid and 53(DEG)C for a black lid.
light gray ::  I chose light grey because it will still attr act heat and absorb some but not a ton. This way the dog house will be at the right tempature and out of the sun. Choosing a light color for this will be good for spring summer fall or those winter days when the sun comes out. It will be a dry place at the perfect tempature if you paint it light grey.
white :: The white dog house can help the dog cool off and it keeps it cooller in the Dog house unlike Black and the darker colors that abosorb, The heat and then so warm the dogHouse and There by inc reasing the Tem(DEG)
white ::  white because that color doesnt absorbs enery and the doghouse be cooler
white ::  it will make it cooler in there, so its not b urning hot in the summer
black :: if its black the doghouse might cunduct more heat but if you choose a lighter color it will not atract as much heat as the dark color.
white ::  Brandi and Jerry should use white paint to keep the dog hose cool in the sun. White would be best because it will absorb the least energy, keeping the temp down, in the test a black colored lid was and average temp of 53, while the white color was 42, and 11(DEG) difference.
light gray :: light gray would make it so the dog was cool inside the house and not to hot and to cold. at black the temperatu re was 53(DEG)c and at white the temperature was 42(DEG)c. but at light gray it was 45(DEG)c so then the temperature would not be to hot or to cold.
white :: Brandi and Jerry should use the color white f or the dog house because brighter colors reflect light to keep the dor co ol. Unless, it is the winter time and you want to keep the dog warm a dar ker color would be better.
white :: I chose white for the color of paint for the dog house. White might affect the doghouse by keeping the inside cooler d uring the day. When the glass jar had a black lid the average temperature was 53(DEG)C. When the glass jar had a white lid after ten minutes the average temperature in the jar was only 42(DEG)C. This is a difference o f 11(DEG)C. White is the better choice for paint color on a doghouse bec ause it will keep a dog cool in the middle of the day.
white :: The experiment shows that if the color is whi te, the less hot the object gets. So if Brandi and Jerry paint it white t he dog would not be as hot if it was black.
light gray :: This color should make the doghouse a nice co ol temperature cosistantly. I say this because in the data table light gr ay's average temp. was 45(DEG).
black :: I think this color will effect the dog house by heating it up when there light energy or heat energy inside of it, bec ause black got the highest average of 53 C(DEG)
white ::  its not to dark
white ::  white would affect the color by not letting the dog house heat up because with the data the result was, the darker the color the more heat so the color white would keep the dog house nice and fresh.
dark gray ::  I chose the color Dark Gray Because when it i s cold outside the house will absorb heat and warm up the doghouse so it wont be cold. But when it is really hot outside it wont absorb as much energy as the black paint so it will be a little cool.
white :: white made the jar the coolest on average in the experement at 42(DEG)C. while black, on average, made the jar the ho ttest at 53(DEG)C. so if you painted the dog house white the temperature inside the dog house should be cooler than if you painted it black, dark gray, or light gray.
white :: If your design for your doghouse was to keep the dog out of the heat then you should choose the white because after ten minutes of a lamps heat the white color kept the temperature down to 42 (DEG)C while the black lid kept the temperature to 53(DEG)C
white :: If the color of the doghouse was white then i think the dog that lives there will want to go in the doghouse more ofte n because its not going to be really hot, its going to be cool.
light gray :: Light Gray. Because the color is not that dar k, but not that light ether. For the summer it wont be that hot, and in t he winter it wont be that cold ether. Also the tempetures of the data cam e out that the gray color is right in the middle(average) of the experime nt.
white :: This way the doghouse will stay cool since th e jar with the white lid had the average temperature or 42(DEG) C.
dark gray :: The greater the increase in the air temperatu re in the glass jar , because darker colors absorb more energy.
black ::  It would make it warmer for the dog so it wou ld be warmer inside the doghouse so the dog would not be too cold. In the experiment the results show that the darker the color, the warmer it is inside.
light gray :: Light gray would be a good color to paint the doghouse. One reason I chose this is because when the sun is beating down on the doghouse, the dog could overheat. Also, the opposite is true as well. If you had a white doghouse, it may make the dog very cold. The black lid had an average of 53(DEG)C, and the white lid had an average of 42(DEG)C. This makes a grey-painted doghouse the best choice.
black :: i think that black she psint the doghouse bec ause it dark and it could absorb more energy and increase in air tempertu re.
white ::  the test proves white dosent get as hot as ot her colors
white ::  the best color to choose for brandi and jerri es dog house would be white because white dosent absorb as much heat as d oes darker colors, for example, in the air temprature expeirament. they p ut a dark colord lid over a jar, with a starting temprature poitn at 24 c elcius. after ten miniutes the took the lid off to find out that the jar had gotten warmer and was recorded at an averege of 53 c. but when they p ut the lighter coverd lid over the jar (at a starting point of 24c) after 10 miniutes they saw that the jar was an averege of only 42 c. so the be st choice would be the color white for your dog house because it will not absorb as much heat and will stay cooler for your dog.
dark gray :: The dark gray color for a doghouse might be b est to keep the dog warm in the winter with the little sun it receives, b ut not overly heated in the summer. In the experiment, the dark gray had the second to highest air temperature with 48(DEG). A black house might absorb too much heat which would be unhealthy for the dog. In the investi gation, the air temperature of black was at 53(DEG). The light gray and white paint color might not absorb enough heat to keep the dog warm which would also be unhealthy for the dog. The air temperatures of the light g ray was 45(DEG) and of the white was 42(DEG). This is why I would choos e the dark gray paint for a doghouse.
white ::  As shown in Brandi and Jerry's experiment, wh ite absorbs less light than the other colors. If the doghouse is painted white, than the air temperature will be less inside of the doghouse, so t he dog will be cooler inside of the doghouse.
white :: In the testing of which color made the air in side of the jar hottest, the black was the hottest, then came the dark gr ay, than light grey, then the white was the coolest so the air inside of the doghouse would be cooler if it was white which would be best for the dog.
white :: it will make it cooler inside because the whi te coloer will deflect light from the house
white ::  dark colors atract heat lighter colors reapel heat
black :: be geos once you go black u never go back
white :: they should choose white because they dont wa nt their dog to get really hot and white wont absorb that much heat so it will stay cool on the inside.
light gray :: light grey would work good because its almost in the middle and maintains a good temperature so it doesnt get to hot b ut not to cold
white :: White is the best color to use for the doghou se. This is becasue the color white reflects the most sunlight and theref ore it wont be as hot insdie the house. With the white colored jar lid, t he average tempurature is 42 (DEG) C. The averages for the Light Gray, D ark Gray and black lids were 45 (DEG) C, 48(DEG) C and 53(DEG) C. This shows that having the doghouse be white would keep the air cooler and mo re comfortable for the dog.
white :: It is the brightest color in this selection a nd the darker the color, the more energy it will absorb. The doghouse wil l usually be humid and hot and dry inside for the dog if alot of the Sun' s solar energy is being absorbed and spread throughout the doghouse. Evidence of this is in the investigation by looking at the average colum n of the data table. By doing so, you can see that White had the lowest a verage temperature at 42(DEG)C, while the Black had an average temperatu re of 53(DEG)C. Dark and light gray were also above white's average, mak ing white the best suited color for the doghouse.
light gray ::  it will make it cool on warm and sunny days b ut on winter days it wont be too cold and it will act as both warm and co ld depending on the day
white :: In the summer the doghouse would not be to wa rm and not as hot as warm as a doghouse that is black.
black :: using the results from the experiment the bes t color for the doghouse if you were looking for the doghouse to be warm would be black because in the experiment it shows that black heats up the most in the same amunt of time.
black :: i think black would be the best color because when it was in the glass bottle after 10 minutes it had the highest scor es.
dark gray :: Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse da rk gray, because then inside of the dog house it would not be too hot or too cold for their dog. If they painted the house black, it would be too hot. The average temperature was 53(DEG)c and the dark gray average temp erature was 48(DEG)c. Light gray and white would make the inside of the doghouse too cold, because those temperatures averaged at 45(DEG)c and 4 2(DEG)c. Therefore, dark grey is just right.
white ::  i chose white because the dog could go in the dog house and not get to hot from the heat of the sun because white does not catch heat as easaly as black.
white ::  In the experiment they said darker colors aso rb more heat, and you do not want more heat in you're dogs house. And you dont want you're dog to overheat so I picked white so it stays cool duri ng the summer.
white :: I say that they should use white because from the data they had from the experiment,it shows that darker colors absorb s more energy then any other colors. White would not take as much absrob energy as shown in the data table given because it's a light color and it would be better for the dog not to have as much absorb energy in it's ho use.
light gray :: If you were to paint the dog house light gray the tempature inside the dog house would not be as hot in summer time or not as cold in the winter time as if you were to pick white it would be colder and black it would be hotter and dark gray would be hotter just n ot as much. light gray would be just in the middle of all of them.
white :: I think white might be the best color for the dog house because when it's sunny out the temperature inside the dog hou se will be cooler becasue in the experiment we learned that white i s cooler proving that it absorbes less heat.
white :: is because on a hot day it wont be as hot in the doghouse if you use white if you use b-lack the dog would be to hot.
black :: It will be the hottest because darker colors absorb more energy.
dark gray :: This color would make the doghouse warm but n ot too warm and it wont be cold inside either.
light gray ::  I chose the light gray paint because in the summer time the dog house won't be too hot or too cold. The light gray rose 21(DEG)C in ten minutes where as the black rose 29(DEG)C and th at means that when it's hot outside the tempature in the dog house will b e hot and uncomfortable.
white :: the inside of the doghouse would be cooler wi th the color white and with black it would be hotter
black ::  Black because it effect lid color on the air temperature and because it absob more energy.
white ::  Having a white color for the dog house will effectively keep the dog at a temperature where the sun wouldn't gradually increase the temperature too hot for the dog to live inside dog house. According to a experiment on Lid Color vs. Air Temperature Inside Glass Jar, a white lid did not help increase the temperature inside the jar. While a grey and black lids effectively increased the temperture over 6 degrees.
dark gray :: I choose dark gray as the color for the dogho use because the white color would be good for summer, but then during the winter the dog would get too cold. The black color would be good for win ter, but then during summer the dog would get too hot. The light gray col or would be good for summer, spring and winter, but not for fall. The dar k gray would be good for summer, fall and winter, and the dog would proba bly spend most of his/her time outside during spring. I would paint the d oghouse dark gray.
light gray ::  Light gray would be the best color for a dog houise beacuse if the dog is outside and its cold outside, the light gray still atractas some warmth to it but not too much for when its hot outsi de. In the experiment light gray had the averge of 45(DEG)C while white had 42(DEG)C and the black had an avergae of 53(DEG)C. This shows that white would be too cold becuase it would not attract alot of sunlight. T he black is too hot by attracting too much sunlight but the light gray at tracts enough sunlight to keep the house cool and warm.
light gray :: This color might affect the doghouse by makin g the doghouse not too hot and not too cold for the dog; a comfortable te mperature for the dog.
black :: Trial 1: (54), Trial 2: (52), Trial 3: (54), Trial 4: (53). This color would keep keep it warm when It needs to be war m, and keep it cool when it needs to be cool.
white ::  That color might affect the doghouse, because the tempurtue will be good for the doghouse.
light gray ::  i choose light gray because in the winter gra y is kinda dark it will be warm, and in the summer it will be cool cause of the light gray.
black ::  The color black absorbs more light, so the do ghouse will be warmer.
dark gray :: the darker the color is the hotter the inside of the house will get so i picked dark grey because black might make it too hot when the sun is on it and white would be too cold.
black :: Black would affect the air temperature in the dog house. In the experiment the black lid color had on average of 53(DEG) C. This color would greatly effect the dog house in the summer. On hot days, the black color would attract heat, which would be a health issue for the dog.
light gray :: Light gray would be a good color because if y ou used black then that would attract energy from the sun causing the sun to hitthe dog house and the dog will get to hot. So if we use light it w ill slightly attract some energy from the sun because the color is a mixt ure between black and white making the dog the right temerature.
light gray :: it will help yhe dog house becuase in the sum mer it wont be to hot and then in the winter it will kepp it warm a littl e
black :: This color will make the inside of the doghouse warmer than the other colors. Dark gray's average temperature was 48 d egrees celcius, light gray's average temperature was 45 degrees celcius, and white's average temperature was 42 degrees celcius.
light gray :: If you use a light gray paint then the inside of the dog house wont be super hot for the dog
white :: It might affect it by the (DEG)c level in th e dog house and it will make it not as cold as the other colors so it a h otter tempature.
dark gray ::  the dark gray could help the dog stay cool in the summer but also stay warm in the winter. in the results of the lab, the dark gray had 48 degrees all the way through the experiment. The dark gray color would be the best color for the dog house.
black ::  How the color might affect the doghouse is by the temperature of the inside of the doghouse. With the proven fact by the experim ent that darker colors absorb more heat, painting the doghouse the color black will increase the temperature of inside the doghouse. In the experi ment, Brandi and Jerry got the results that the color black (out of all the colors) had the hottest temperature of the inside of the glass jar.
dark gray ::  It makes the house pretty hot so the dog won't get cold but it's not so hot that the dog will get too warm
light gray :: Becasue it isn't too dark and it isn't too light , it's just right for the dogs eyesight .
dark gray :: That effect would warm up the dog house sothe dog will not be cold.
black :: if they use the color black the inside air te mpature would be the warmest according to there data.
dark gray :: I think that a dark gray would be the best co lor to paint the dog house. Sense dark colors attract solar heat...but it all depends on where the dog house will be located...for example...if yo ur somewhere where its normally hot outside...you should paint the house white or light gray. But if this dog house is going to be somewhere where its normally cold outside...paint it dark gray or black.
black :: its my favorite color
light gray :: I think it wuold be light gray because dogs d ont like to be that warn and not that cold.
white :: If you paint the dog house white, it will sta y nice and cool and won't get too hot because the data showed that when t he lid was white, the average temperature, 42(DEG)C, was colder than the others. When the lid was black the average temperature was highest, 53(DEG) C, which is 11(DEG) more than the white lid's average.
white :: ti make ti litere
white :: i think they should paint the dog house white because in the summer it will keep the doghouse cooler insi de and keep the dog from getting to hot.
light gray :: Light gray might not affect the dog house bec ause in the summer when its really hot it went wont get really hot inside because light gray is not as dark. The dog house might just be the right temperture not to hot and not to cold just right.
white ::  It will affect the doghouse because i won't be as hot inside if its painted white but if its painted black or another color it will be hotter inside.
white :: White would affect the doghouse by making it cooler than any other color shown.
white :: white will make the dog house as cool as poss ible
white :: Having a white colored dog house is the best option because its the one that got the lowest temperature in the experim ent which was 42(DEG)C average. And since you dont want your dog to get a heat stroke then whites the best. The other colors averages were black= 53(DEG)C dark gray=48(DEG)C and Light gray= 45(DEG)C which are to hot for a dog to be living in.
white :: This is the best possible paint color for a d oghouse for the summer. But for the winter it would be black.
white :: whtie is the best color to paint the dog hous e because, in Brandi and Jerry's experiment the darker lid's had a higher tempature. black had a ending tempature average of 53(DEG) C and the wh ite lid had a ending tempature average of 42(DEG) C. therefor, white wou ld be the better paint color to keep the dog house cooler for the dog.
white ::  The white paint would make it colder in the doghouse on hot summer days.
white ::  less solor energy less hot the dogs house wil l be
black :: Because it's average is very high. And it cou ld do something to it.
black :: Darker colors attract and absorb more light s o if you paint the doghouse black then the sun's rays will hit the house and cause the black paint to absorb the light and keep the dog house warmer.
light gray :: it will heat the dog house so it is warm and not to hot or too cold because in the data the light gray color was just about the middle.
white :: the white lid had the lowest tempriture at 42 degrees celcius so it would make the doghouse allot cooler compare d to the black lid at 53 degrees celcius
black :: i chose black because the average inside temp erature after ten minutes was 53 degreee celcius, so then the dog house w ould be warmer for the dog.
black ::  if they used black for there dog house there dog would be very warm because it would keep all the heat in there for keeping the dog warm because the black will be traping in the heat that is why people don't wear black on a hot day. I can say this because in the data table for black the average temperature was 53(DEG) and that was the highest temperature there was this is why I think Brandi and Jerry should use black for there dog house.
white :: It would make it cooler than the other colors . White ended up about 42(DEG)C while black was about 53(DEG)C.
white ::  White will affect the doghouse because its average of air temperature inside a glass jar for 10 minutes was 42(DEG), while light gray was 45(DEG), dark gray was 48(DEG), and black was 53(DEG) .
black :: Because dogs are colored blind and if the dog house is painted black then the dog wouldnt be able to see it.
white :: White will reduce the temperature in side the doghouse. In the experiment white had an average of 42(DEG)C while the other colors had higher temperature averages.
black :: The black paint would absorb heat. That would keep the doghouse warm. The results showed that the jar with the black l id was th warmest after 10 minues.
dark gray :: i how not mack the dog house black it will be to hot
white :: It will make the air cooler becuase it's aver age was 42. It started at 24 so it only went up by 18 and black went up b y 29 because black ended at 53.
dark gray :: dark gray would be better because you dont wa nt the dog to be cold if it were to live in the dog house but you dont wa nt it to be to warm for the dog.
white :: White is a very light color. But with black i t attracts the sun. so inside this doghouse when black, it can get hot. b ut with the white it can also get warm but not hot as 53(DEG)c as the black had. the white had a average of 42(DEG)c which is not hot comp ared to 53(DEG)c.
black :: the color affects the dog house by the tempat ure inside the doghouse if the color is darker it will be hoter if the co lor is lighter it will he colder and so on. and because the doghouse will probaly be outside i chose black so that it is warmer
light gray :: it won't be as hot inside of the doghouse, ma king it more comfortable for the dog in the hotter months, but it will st ill be warm enough that the dog will be comfortable in the colder months.
light gray ::  The color might affect the doghouse because l ight gray will not make it too hot or too cold, the temperature will be in the middle.
black :: this color will help keep the insideof the do ghouse warmer. the black colored lid is 9(DEG) warmer than the white col ored lid.
light gray ::  After being exposed to heat, white was the coolest with 42(DEG)C, followed by light gray with 45(DEG)C, dark gray, and then black. By using light grey, the doghouse would stay fairly cool in the summer, unlike black, and absorb a fair abount of heat in the cold winter, unlike white.
black ::  Well the darker the color is the more heat it produces in the atmosphere so id suggest black because the dog is outsid e, so the dog will stay warm at a good temperature. on the table of the expirement it shows that having a black lid on trial one gave it 54 degrees on white on trial one it was only about 42 degrees. 12 degree difference!
white ::  it will not make it hot during the summer so the dog can cool him self
white :: i would choose white because it will keep the dog cool in the summer time because the white lid had an average tempera ture of 42(DEG)C whereas the light grey had an average of 45(DEG) C, the dark grey had an average of 48(DEG)C and the black had an average of 53(DEG)C.
black :: If they use black paint on the doghouse then the doghouse will be hotter than with any other color. In the experiment the black lid's average temperature was 53 degrees and all the other colo rs were more cold.
white ::  The color white would affect the doghouse by cooling it off because in the experiment the air temperature of the jar with the white lid was 42 degrees in comparison to the air temperature in the jar with the blakc lid which was 53 degrees. That makes black 9 degrees hotter then white.
white ::  Whit wouldnt arelly affect it cause in the wi nter there is not much sun so the color would make no difference but in t he summer it would be the same because sun does not affect the color whit e especailly in the heat.
black ::  becuase when it gets hot outside the sun atracts black and then it will heat up the doghouse and the dog house would get to hot and then the dog would really hot.
white ::  White would probably be the best choice to paint the dog house. It would stay at a temperature of about 42(DEG)C. This color doesn't attract heat like black or dark colors do. So I think this would be the best choice.
light gray ::  i have know idea
white ::  White will keep the dog house cooler than any darker colors. This is because, the average air temperature of the jar w ith the white lid was 42(DEG)C, the light grey lid was 45(DEG)C, the da rk grey lid was 48(DEG)C, and the balck lid was 53(DEG)C. The differenc e between the darkest (black) lid and the white lid was 11(DEG)C.
white :: white so the doghouse stays cooler because ac ording to the table white makes the temp inside the jar the coolest
black ::  Black would affest the dog house becasue the sun attracts to black very easily and will make the dog house very hot on the inside.
white :: it will make it cooler for the dog and the do g wont over heat and become thirsty all the time
white ::  The white paint color would keep the inside of the doghouse more cooler than the other colors because lighter colors absorb less heat.
black :: They should do the dog house black because th e aveerage in the expierament was 53(DEG) and that is around the temepat ure that a dog would wanna stay in while its sleeping , also beacuase whe n its sunny the black darkens the dog house while the dog sleeps.
dark gray :: I picked ths color because if it is hot day the dog wouldnt want his house black because it will just make it too hot for him, then if its white it will just be too cool for him. So I that dark gray will be just warm enough for hiom
light gray ::  The best color for Brandi and Jerry to paint their dog house would probably light gray. This is because while the lid that absorbed the most heat (black) had an average temperature of 53(DEG) C and the coolest (white) had an average temperature of 42(DEG)C, the light gr ey lid had an average temperature of 45(DEG)C, a medium between the two, which would make the doghouse retain heat in the winter and keep it cool in the summer.
dark gray ::  can keep warm temperature for the dog in the Winter but not so hot in the summer
white :: IT WILL BE BETTER BECAUSE THE WHITER THE COLO R THE BETTER BEACAUSE IT WILL NOT ABSORB THAT MUCH ENRGY .
white :: This color would affect the doghouse because the color white reflects light, while as the color black or darker colors absorb light, so with the choice of white, the doghouse would not heat u p as much as it would if Brandi and Jerry were to use a darker color.
black :: This color will keep the inside of the doghou se warmer. Dark colors absorb more heat energy. In the experiment w ith the jar, the air was always warmer in the jar with a black lid rather than jars with lighter color
black ::  This color might affect the dog house becaus e black absorbs the most energy that is given. It is shown in the results that black lid color has an average of 53(DEG)C
light gray :: I chose light gray because it would stay cool in summer and a little warmer in the winter.
black :: Using black as the color of the doghouse will make it hotter. In the experiment the black lid made the air the hottest . This would help the dog stay warmer in the winter. It would be the best color choice as long as the owners live in a cold climate.
light gray :: The light colro of the dog house will hlp to keep the doghouse cool and ideal in hot temperatures, but will also absor b enough thermal energy from the sun to had a semi-warm environment. Whil e the black lid color in the experiment created an average jar-air temper ature of 53(DEG), that temperature is very hot and a dag would feel very uncomfortable within that environment. However, if we look at the white lid, it had an average temperature of 42(DEG). That temperature is a bit too low and it might not absorb enough thermal evergy on days that it is cooler. However, the light gray lid had an average of 45(DEG) in the tr ials. Its temperature was msot ideal and it would create the most balance d environmetn for the dog to live in.
black ::  Black would make the doghouse warm inside. In the experiment, the average temperature for black jars was 53(DEG)C
white :: the color white would affect the doghouse bec ause the tempuature will be cooler.
light gray :: It would keep the dog house at a good tempera ture not attracting to much light but enough to where the dog house isnt very cold.
light gray ::  it will put some heat in but will also keep i t cool in the day
white :: White because white absorbs less heat energy from the sun.In the experiment Brandi and Jerry discovered that darker co lors affect how much energy they can absorb. So that's why white is the b est color to choose to make a new doghouse.Because it doesn't absorb that much energy from the sun.
"black :: Black (darker) colored paint will absorb the energy from the light source (lamp) and keep it heated up inside the dog house. Like the ""Air Temperature"" experiment, the black lid color, had 54(DEG)C while the white lid color had a 42 (DEG)C, proving that the darker the color there is, the more heat is absorbed, keeping it more warm."
dark gray :: Dark grey would be the best color for them to make the dog house because the air temperature wouldn't be too hot or to o cold for the dog. Also the temperature stayed the same for all the tria ls which means that it won't change no matter how hot the weather may be.
dark gray :: I would choose to paint the doghouse dark gra y because the color would not be too dark or too light so it wouldn't mak e the doghouse too warm or cold. The data supports this because the jar w ith the dark gray lid had a temperature that was more in between that of the black and white jars, when the light gray jar had a temperature that was closer to the white jar, making it to cold.
white ::  it would affect the doghouse by it would stay cool in there. In the experamint white had the lowest temputure
dark gray ::  not a lot just a agents the sun
white ::  It will make it warm inside the doghouse beca use the light did not penetrate it alot, so the thermometer did not go as high
dark gray :: it will keep it a nice temperature not too wa rm and not too cold
white :: It wont be as hot for the dog.
white :: i think white because it would keep the most heat out
black :: the color black would effect the doghouse bec ause the sun is attracted to the color black.also in the data table the color black has the highest results on the temperture.
dark gray :: This color will allow the doghouse to be reli tively warm in the winter yet cool enough in the summer to keep the dog c omfterble. The average temperature of the Dark Gray lid was 48(DEG)C, 5(DEG) C cooler than the average temperature for the hottest lid, which was the Black lid, and therefore shows that the doghouse will be able to sustain a comt erble temperature.
white :: the dog house should be white because the col or white, deflects the heat waves so the inside of the dog house would be cooler. If the dog house was painted black, it would absorb more heat wa ves and then the dog house would get hotter.
light gray ::  It will make the dog house warmer in the wint er but will not make it too warm in the summer.
white :: Paint the doghouse white if where you live is hot, because black attracts too much heat. Paint the doghouse black if y ou live somewhere cold because the heat can't affect that.
white :: White might make the doghouse cooler beacuse white, in the experiment, showed it would increase the temperature by 20 or so degrees C. When black increased by 30 or so degrees C.
white :: i picked the white color because the affect o f white color paint makes the temperature for the dog house to be alot mo re cooler so if the dog house is white the dog's temperature will be alot more cooler than the other colors their is
black :: the color might afferct the doghouse because mybe the dog dasent like the color they put on the dogs house or myebe is to dark or to briet for the dog. and calculate and rec ord the average air temperature for each lid color .
black ::  I chose black because black is going to keep the dog house warmer. If they paint the dog house white, the light will just reflect off, butt if they choose black then they will keep the warm, I know this because on the experiment they did with the lamp the average temperature with the black lid was 53(DEG) C, but the average temperature with the white lid was 42(DEG) C. So black would be the best color for the dog house.
black :: this would make the doghouse very hot and unc omfortable because, as shown in the expirament, black attracts heat bring ing more thermal energy to the dog house than other colors such as white.
white :: The color white might affect the doghouse by keeping it cooler because the black had an average of 53(DEG) C. The dar k gray had an average temperature of 48(DEG) C, and the light gray had a n average temperature of 45(DEG) C. Finally, the white had an average te mperature of 42(DEG) C. So the black jar had the highest temperature (da rkest color) and the white had the lowest temperature (brightest color). So inside the doghouse will be less warm if you put on the white paint
black :: The color black might affect the dog house be cause black is the drakest color out of the's four colors.
white :: It should be white beacuse if its a dark color it would attract motre energy/heat.
black ::  the black is going to make it a lot warmer in side the dog house
white :: white because it will not tack or exorb the h eat.
black ::  It might affect the doghouse because its a dark color and it will be darker and hotter in the doghouse sence dark colors absorb more engery.
black :: This color paint (Black) will attract more he at to the inside of the dog house. We know this because the averge of hea t in side the jar on Bradi and Jerry exsperiment was 54(DEG) C for black paint and 42(DEG) C for the white paint. So you can see that if you wer e wanting to keep the inside of the doghouse warm you would want to paint it black.
black :: The color black might affect the inside of th e doghouse because if the color of the house is darker it will increase t he temp of the house inside
black ::  it will make the temperature inside of the do ghouse hotter.
white :: Painting the doghouse white will make it so t hat the temperature inside will be cooler, because as tests show, white c ompared to black can have a temperature difference of 12 degrees celsius.
white ::  The white color may affect the dog house by making it more cooler than solid colors because it reflects the light insted of absorbing more light energy caused form the sun.
white :: white reflect the light. when you use white c olor temperature will lower than when you use dark color. In the expieren ce when you use white the temperature was42(DEG)C but when you use black the temperature was 53(DEG)C. When you use white color temperature was 9(DEG)C lower than when you use dark color.
light gray ::  In the test results the white at the average of 42(DEG)C was the coolest while black at the average of 53(DEG)C was the hottest. While light gray is averiging 45(DEG)c, it will not be too hot or too cold for the dog.
dark gray ::  During each trial it stayed 48(DEG)C Which i snt to hot or cold. It might affect it buy whether its snowing or really cold outside he wont freeze because the color is trying to attract some k ind of heat. For when its hot It would attract some sunlight though but n ot as much as black. So its fairly compfortable for a dog.
black :: black would be the best color to use so that the dog will stay warm. the average tempature using black was 53.25(DEG) C
black :: Painting The Doghouse Black Will Result In Th e Temperature Inside To Be Higher. The Darker The Color Is On The Outside Will Absorb More Heat Energy Into The Doghouse. This Will Help Because I t Will Keep The Dog Warmer.
black :: It would affect the doghouse because the colo r black is going to make the doghouse hotter.
light gray :: This color might affect the inside of the dog house because the result in the experiment was that the lighter the color the lower temperature. I chose light gray because on sunny days when the dog need shade or cooling off it can just go into the doghouse where it will be the perfect temperature; cold, but not freezing.
black :: the color that i chose that may effect the in side of the dog house because from heat it will give the dog shade for th e dog house. from the expirement it shows when they put th e dark black lid on top of the gar it hows that the temerature decreases after they put the thermometer in the glass gar.
black :: will absord more energy
white :: it would be the best because it would keep th e dog cool because what had the lowest average temperature
white :: the white absorbs less heat and keeps cooler
white ::  white will keep the doghouse cooler, because it will be only 42(DEG)c inside, then if Brandi and Jerry were to use black it would be 54(DEG)c inside of the doghouse because black absobes light, and white reflects the light so the heat doesnt go inside of the doghouse.
light gray :: light gray because it wouldn't be that hot in the summer time and in would not be that cold. becaue in the results the average for light grey was 45(DEG).and that in perfect tempature
light gray :: I chose the light gray because on average it was 45(DEG)C, so it wouldn't be too hot o too cold for the dog.
white ::  The lighter the color is, the more light ener gy it reflects. If most of the light energy is reflected, the less hotter it will be inside the doghouse or whatever you're painting.
white :: The color of the dog house affected the temperature inside.
white ::  I would chose white, because that will make it the coldest and if i were a dog i wouldnt want it to be really hot, id want it to be as cold as i could get it. for black the average was the wa rmest with 53(DEG)C, for dark gray it was in the middle with 48(DEG)C, for light gray it was also in the middle with 45(DEG)C, and white was the coldest wtih 42(DEG)C. The white paint will keep the doghouse less insul ated, and more open. it will keep it so its not so hot and not so cold be cause 42(DEG)C isnt cold or hot its in the middle.
white :: White would be the best color. this is becaus e on average it had the lowest tempature inside, so it asorbed or blocked the most heat, it had an averge of 42 degrees while black had an average of 53 degrees
black :: it would increase the temerature more than an y colors selected.
black :: black
white :: i think they should go with white so the dog house doesnt get to hot because the black paints number was 53 for the av erage and the litest color whites average was 42 so i think that the colo r that would be best for the dog house would be white beacuse it re flects less heat from the other three colors which were black dark gre li ght grey and white.
white :: it would keep the inside of the doghouse cool er
white :: because white is the the color that regects a ll light there for keeping the light rays from soaking in causing heat
light gray ::  The lighter the color of the doghouse, the co oler the temperature is inside, and the darker the color of the dog house , the warmer it is inside, because when the lid color was black, the aver age temperature was 53(DEG)C. But when the lid color was white, the aver age temperature was 42(DEG)C, which had a difference of 11(DEG).
black :: because black is a dark color and it will atr ackt te sun, so then the tempeture is going to change
light gray ::  They don't want it to be too cold, but not to o hot either. A light gray dog house won't be too cold for the dog, but a lso not too hot because it'll just warm the dog house up 11(DEG)C. That isn't too much, so the dog won't suffocate, but it won't freeze to death either.
white ::  Assuming that you want to keep the doghouse c ool, i would choose to paint it white because it reflects the least amoun t of light.
black ::  The average temperature inside the glass jar with a black lid was 53(DEG)C. With a dark gray lid, the average tempera ture was 48(DEG)C. With a light gray lid, the average temperature was 45 (DEG)C. With a white lid, the average temperature was 42(DEG)C. The sta rting temperature was 24(DEG)C, so the average temperature for the black lid raised the starting temperature by 29(DEG)C. The average temperatur e for the black lid also kept the glass jar 11(DEG) warmer than the whit e lid. Therefore to keep the inside of the doghouse warm, and also to kee p the dog warm in cold temperatures, black would be the best color, becau se it had the highest average temperature inside the glass jar.
light gray :: I believe that the Light Gray color would be optimal for the doghouse. It would keep the temperature inside to a pleas ant level, not too hot or cold. The average temperature of the jar with t he Light Gray lid after ten minutes was 45(DEG) C.
light gray :: Light gray will affect the doghouse because, based on the data the light gray color was the second coolest at an avera ge of 45(DEG). This will help because during the summer when it is hot, it will keep the doghouse cooler. But, it will also help during the winte r and keep the dog house warmer.
light gray :: This color would be the best for the doghouse because if you were to use black, the dog would get really hot because t he darker the color the more energy it will attract and make it hotter. I f you use white then it doesn't get as much energy so the dog may get col d because the lighter the color the less energy you will attract. light g ray is inbetween so it will attract some energy but not to much.
white :: the color white may affect the doghouse in a better way than the other three colors because according to the dat a table the lid color black, dark gray, light gray, all had higher air te mperatures. the color white had the lowest average air temperature inside the jar. therefore, white would be a better color for the doghouse becau se the air temperature inside of the doghouse would be less than the othe r three colors.
black :: the color will increase the air tempeature in side the dog house.
white :: this would affect the dog house because in th e summer the dog would stay cool and not get hot but in the winter it cou ldnt get colder than if the dog house was black
white ::  the inside would be cooler because dark color s absorb heat and white refects it
white :: White will keep the doghouse more chill than black or dark gray cause of their hot temps..when white has a temp of 42 degrees celcius..keeping the doghouse nice and cold..
white ::  I think the color for the doghouse should be the color white because it doesnt attract heat and if we were to choose the black color inside the doghouse it would be hot .The black color's average is 53 and the white colors average is 42.
black :: becouse the dog house would look filthy
black :: Black will affect the dog house and make it h otter, because black atracts the sun
dark gray ::  dark grey because their all 48in all differen t procdures
dark gray ::  The best paint color for the doghouse would be dark gray, because it will not be too hot or too cold for the dog inside. Dark gray was the color that absorbed the second highest temperature, so the temperature will keep the dog warm, but not too hot.
light gray :: Light gray because it didnt heat up that much , but it did a little so the dogs house wouldnt get too hot in the summer or too cold in the winter
white :: the color should be white because so its not super duper hot when the suns out.
"white ::  Using white to paint the doghouse will affect its temperature because it absorbs the least amount of heat from the sun , refurring back to the ""Hot Lamp"" experiment, we know that whi te absorbs the least amount of heat because in all 3 trials, the average amount of heat absorbed by the white lid was 42(DEG) after 10 minutes, t hat is only 18(DEG)C more than the temperature it started at (24(DEG) C). This is how we would know which paint to use for the dog house."
black ::  the color black will make a higher temperature in the dog house then dark gray light gray, or white because darker colors absorb more energy. this is supported by the data of the ex periment hot lamp. the average temperature inside the glass jar after 10 minutes for the black lid was 53 degrees celsuis, the average temperature for the dark gray lid inside the glass jar was 48 degrees celsuis, the a verage temperature for the light gray lid inside the glass jar after 10 m inutes was 45 degrees celsuis, and the average temperature inside the gla ss jar after 10 minutes for the white lid was 42 degrees celsuis. this da ta shows proof that darker colors will increase the temperature in the do g house.
dark gray ::  the color affect the dog house because with dark gray the temperature is kept the same instead of varying from one temp to the other. Plus dog dont want it to be too cold in there dog house so i figured they want a temperature that will keep them warm and kinda chill
black :: it will make the dog house really hot.
black ::  By using black for the color of the dog house , the inside of the house will be warmer than the other colors, because d arker colors absorb more heat. According to Brandi and Jerry's chart it i s true, because after 10 minutes the black lit had the warmest air inside the jar.
dark gray ::  it will keep same temp. and will be too hot nor cold
black ::  It will make the doghouse warmer inside which would be good for the winter time so the dog isnt cold and miserable.
white ::  the color will affect the dog house because i t will make it alot cooler in the dog house when the sun is out and it wi ll look better(:
white ::  they paint the color whit because it at tracts less sun light.
white ::  white paint color because that way the dog wo nt be hot instead it would be cool
black :: it wil heat the dog house up more than the ot her colors.
light gray ::  eeee
black :: If the doghouse is black, it will absorb more energy then the other colors. This is apparent in the test, where the st arting temperature for the glass jar was 24(DEG) C, and the black jar we nt up to 53(DEG) C, while the white jar only went up to 42(DEG) C.
light gray :: It will make it slighty cooler than hot. It w ill affect the dog house as making the dog house warm on cold days and not to hot on hot days.
white ::  That color would allow the doghouse to be coo ler and not so hot and stuffy.
white :: white because it dosnt obsorb as much heat as dark lids.
light gray :: The color of light gray might affect the dog house by keeping it the right temprature (not too cold or too hot) becaus e the darker the color the hotter it gets and the lighter the color the c ooler it gets, according too the data in which i got the information.
white :: the wite color will make the dog house cooler so it wont be hot and stuffy.
black :: If you had a dog house black then all the the rmal enegy will go to it and be warmer for your dog. Inside the dog house would be warm for your dog to live in. As it shows in the data black was with the highest temperture.
white :: if the dog house was painted black and was exposed to the sun for to long it would get to ht.now if it was painted white the house wont get to hot
dark gray :: dark gray because the temperature wont be to hot or to cold it would be just the right temperature for the dog.
light gray ::  The light gray only attracts 45 degrees celci us and that is pretty warm. During the winter the dog won't freeze and du ring the summer it won't sweat a lot.
dark gray :: The color will affect the dog house by keepin g it warm in winter and not so hot in summer.
white :: white because if not you could over heat the dog yu want to keep it cool
white ::  A white paint on the dog house might work the best for summer and according to the data table, the white color's avera ge temperature was the lowest so it will be good for days when it's hot.
white :: white so it doesnt get hot in there when its summer. cause darker colors attract heat
light gray :: This color might affect the doghouse because when the weather is warm outside the doghouse will stay cool but also be a bit warm. Also, when the weather is cold outside the doghouse wil l be warm but aslo a bit cool. I know this because when the light g ray lid was used on the jar the temperature inside the jar was average an d stayed cool. However the lid was also a bit warm. The lowes t temperature inside the glass jar with the light gray lid on was 44(DEG)C while the highest was 46(DEG)C which, if this is the sa me with the doghouse will make the doghouse feel like a great temperature .
white ::  it would make it cooler inside because white reflects the sun rays and black absorbs them.
black ::  The darker the color, the warmer it will be i nside of the doghouse becuase darker colors absorb more energy.
light gray :: The best color to paint a doghouse would be l ight gray because according to the selection light gray was cooler than b lack by 8(DEG) and it was 3(DEG) hotter than white which would allow th e dog to be cooler in the summer but still warm in the winter
black :: the inside of the doghouse would be much warm er inside the doghouse then the other colors. the black attracts more hea t.
white :: White paint would be best because it would ke ep the interior of the dog house cool. The white lid had an average of 42 (DEG) C while the black lid got up to 53(DEG) C. Unless you want your d og to be too hot in his or her doghouse, I suggest you paint it white. Al so, white looks much better on houses than black, dark grey, or light gre y.
dark gray ::  the dark gray might effect the iside by the temputer because the starting temputer in the exsperiment was 24 degrees and it ended up being 48 degrees each time
light gray :: Using a light gray paint on a dog house will help keep it warm inside on cold days and cool inside on warm days so the dog is always comfortable. I would pick light gray for the color because it had an average temperature of 45(DEG)C inside the glass jar and that is a nice even temperature for cold and warm days.
black :: They should paint the dog house black because that on avergage had the highest temperature of 53(DEG)C. Which was 5(DEG) C higher than the second warmest roof color of Dark Gray and 11(DEG)C higher t han the coldest roof color, white.
dark gray :: it wont be too hot or too cold.
dark gray :: dark gray
dark gray :: The white paint would reflect all of the ligh t rays, therefore keeping the dog house cooler for the dog to escape the heat. The black lid had an average of 53(DEG) C air temperature in side the jar after 10 minutes, but the white lid had and average of 42(DEG) C air temperature inside the jar, after 10 minutes. This is a difference of 11 (DEG) C. The white dog house would keep a dog cooler than any other colo r of paint.
white ::  The color White will affect the dog house, by in the summer when it is hotter outside the white wont absorbe to much h eat, keeping the dog house cooler. The average temperature for the Whute lip was 42 (the coolest temperater) And the average for black was 53 (the highest) the lower the number the cooler it is. White would be the best choice for the doghouse.
black ::  Black is the best color because it increases the air temperature so the dog won't be cold.
light gray :: Using Light Gray would keep the tempurature a t an even or equal rate. If it was cold, it wouldn't keep it as warm, but not super cold either. If it was hot outside, the dog house would keep s orta cool, but not extremely hot either. The average of Black is a high a t 53 degrees. which is super hot. Then White would be too cold at an aver age temp at 42 degrees.
white :: The white paint will keep the dog house warm in the winter but won't be too hot in the summer. The average temperture of the white lid was 42(DEG)C. This way the dog will be comfortable in the house with the white paint color.
light gray :: Light gray might affect the doghouse because it will absorb enery, making the inside warm for the dog. Since the color doesn't absorb all of the energy, the doghouse will still be cool compar ed to having the paint black and keeping all of the energy in. Light gray paint will absorb only a certain amount of energy.
black :: white because it was less heat in 10min. Also the temputers only got to around 40- 45(DEG)
light gray :: Light gray because it would keep the dog hous e warm and still a little bit cool for the dogs temperature. The temperat ure stays to an average of 45(DEG) C.
white :: white paint will keep the inside of the dodho use cool because in their expirment the tempature of the white was 42(DEG) c it will keep the dog comfortable.
black ::  in the summer it can make the inside of the d og house hot.
white :: dark colors will seem confusing just keep it white
white ::  Brandi and Jerry should design a doghouse wit h the color white, because the white lid's average air temperature i n the jar was only 42(DEG) C, the lowest temperature of all the lids. Th is would make the doghouse have a lower temperature when exposed to light , to keep the dog cooler. As you can see the average air temperature in the jar for the white lid was only 42(DEG) C as compared to the black lid which had an average of 53(DEG)C. This is an increase in 11(DEG) C a clear in crease of air temperature in the jar from the white to the black lid, and therefore showing that with the white paint the air temperature within t he doghouse when exposed to light will be the lowest compared to all othe r paint colors tested.
white :: The color will reflect most of the heat and t he inside of the doghouse will stay cooler. In the experament, the temper ature of the jar with the white lid only was raised an average of 16(DEG) C.
white :: By painting the doghouse white, the temperatu re in the doghouse will not be that high. according to the experiment, us ing a white lid will keep the temperature inside the jar low. so by paint ing the doghouse white, the temperature in the doghouse will stay low.
dark gray ::  This color will absorb enough energy to where the air temperture is comfortable and not very cold or very hot.
white ::  The best color for the doghouse will be white because of the results both Brandi and Jerry did white seem to be the color that is way more cooler than any other colors by this I mean in average tempeture for the color white was 42(DEG) C which means that the dog will feel freash being inside the doghouse every day it not to cold but not to warm either.
light gray ::  black holds heat in so it would be to hot and white hardly holds any heat.so light gray can still hold heat while giving the dog that nice cool feeling.
light gray :: Brandi and Jerry should paint their dog house light gray because it won't absorb as much heat/energy as the darker colors. In the data is shows that the black lid got the hottest (53(DEG) C) , while the light gray lid only reached 45(DEG) C. It will still collect heat to keep the doghouse warm but not as much as the darker colors.
light gray ::  light gray is a good color because it will ke ep the inside of the dog house not soo hott and not soo cold it will keep it warm.When the sun hits the god house it will not make it really hot a s it would if it were black or dark gray.
black :: i chouse black becase black makes it hoter nd that will affect the doghouse by making it hotter....in the expiriment i t showed that black is hotter.
white :: It won't effect it at all becuase white don't asorb to much energy and won't cuase any heat like black will
black :: if they use the darkest color available then it absorbs the heat energy better so that when the dog uses the dog house it will be warm.
white :: The paint color that they should use is white . This is because the average temperature of the white lid was 42(DEG), while the average temperatures for the other colors were 45, 48, and 53(DEG) . This shows that the white lid was 11(DEG) degrees color on average than the black lid. Therefore, the dog would stay cooler and more comfortable in t he white house, wheras he could become too hot in the black one.
light gray :: It wont make the dog hot or cold because it's in between.The highest tempature would be to hot because its 54(DEG) an d the lowest would be to cold which is 41(DEG) and light gray is in the middle of both the tempatures so its not too hot or cold.
black :: If the dog house had a black roof, it would benefit the dog in all kinds of weather. For example, in the winter time or when it is cold out, the black roof keeps all of the dog's body heat in the house, instead of wasting it. And in the summer, when it's hot, he'll be outside playing, and his doghouse temperature won't matter that much .
black :: It would make the doghouse warmer.
light gray :: the doghouse would not get too hot
light gray ::  You dont want the dog to hot so make it so it will be cooler inside. It will be about 45(DEG)C
white ::  white will keep the dog cool in the summer. s o the dog house wont be super hot it will be cool enough to be in comfurt ably for the dog.in the winter it will just be a normal temperature.
white :: white because it holds the least amount of he at.
light gray :: Well ,I pick Light gray because I wouldnt wan t too much energy in my dogs house if i had to pick a color . Most dogs g oes in their house soo they can either cool off or to relax .
light gray :: Light gray will be the best color to paint fo r the dog house, because it wouldn't attract a lot of heat like the color black and dark gray would.
dark gray :: The light grey color of the dog house would m ake it nuetral inside because it stayed the same throughout each experime nt.
black :: The sun absorbs more energy in the color. Mak ing the inside of the doghouse hot &amp; warm.
dark gray :: i think it should be dark gray becuase when i ts summer the color will absorb heat so he cant say nice and warm and coo l at the same time..
black :: if they painted the doghouse black, then it w ill be hotter inside the doghouse because the darker the color the more heat it will absorb. example: the black lid created the hottest air temperature in the jar.
white :: The best color to paint a doghouse is white because white keeps the doghouse less warmer
black :: a black doghouse will hold in heat so the dog wont get cold. a white dog house will make it colder than all of the oth er colors.
white :: the darker the color is the hotter it will be inside. the lighter the color is it will not be as no t inside.
white :: The color white will effect the inside of the doghouse because it will keep it cooler in the summer when it hot. For example, when the white lid was placed under the lamp it heated up to abou t 42(DEG)C but when the black lid was placed under the lamp it heated up to about 53(DEG)C.
white :: white will, attract less heat. i say this bec ause, it had the lowest average of 42(DEG) thats 1(DEG) less than gray, 6(DEG) less that dark grey, and 11(DEG) less than black.
light gray ::  well if the color is to dark then the doghous e would be to hot so use a color the might not make the dohouse to
black :: i think black would be the best for the color of a dog house because darker color aborb more energy and black is the d arkest one
dark gray :: Brandi and Jerry should pant their doghouse d ark gray. I think they should paint the doghouse dark g ray because in the experiment Hot Lamp the average of the averages in tha t experiment was 57, and the closest temperature of the averages in that experiment is the dark gray lid.
white :: because in the graph is says the average is 4 2 and thats why i picked white cause different chemical.
white ::  The color white will affect the dog house by changing the temperature and making it much cooler in the dog house . In the experiment it showed that the color white was much colder thanth e othercolors they testedit was an average of 42 when black was 53C
black ::  The color will keep the doghouse temperature warmer. The black color will absorb the heat of the day and keep the dogh ouse warm at night.
white :: White would be the best because then the dog would not get too hot.
black :: The color Black would increase air temperatur e inside the doghouse. This is modeled in the experiment because when the lid on the jar was black it had an average inside air temperature of 53(DEG) C and when the Lid color was White the air temperature inside was only an avera ge of 42(DEG)C. So this shows that when the color black is used instead of white you will have an average air temperature increase of 11(DEG)C.
black :: In the expirement, the jar with the black lid was on average 53(DEG)C after being exposed to the lamp for ten minuets . The dark grey lid was only 48(DEG)C, 5(DEG)C less than that of the bl ack lid. The jar with a white lid was only 42(DEG)C, 11(DEG)C less than the jar with the black lid. To warm up the dog house by just the sunligh t Brandi and Jerry should paint the dog house black to increase the tempe rature within the dog house. Compared to the results with the jars, the b lack paint would absord the sunlight and warm up the dog house more than painting it white as with the jars expirement, the black lid warmed up th e jar 11(DEG)C more than the jar with the white lid.
white :: I would choose white because, white does not absorb a lot of light so there for, when iit is hot outside your dog will not get to hot inside of its doghouse. I choose the color white because in the experiment it shows that the average temperature for the white lid was 42 and for the Black lid it was 53. that is an 11(DEG)c difference between the two colors. So for a dog house I highly considered it being w hite.
light gray :: The light gray will make the dogs house not t oo cold and not too hot for the dog. The average tempature would probably be around 40-50(DEG) because the light gray lid on the jar had an avera ge 45(DEG) C but a dog house is a different size from a jar so the tempa ture will vary a little.
white ::  The best color for the dog house is white. This is because acording to Brandies and Jerrys experiment the white dog house gives the least amount of heat into the dog house. For the Black dog house the average temperature would be 53(DEG)C for the Dark Grey dog house the average temperature would be 48(DEG)C for the Light Grey dog house the teperature would be 45(DEG)C and the White dog house would have a temerature 42(DEG)C. Acording to this data the best color for a dog house would be white.
white :: If the dark the color the hotter it gets why not choose white to keep the dog nice and cool in some ways.
white :: White is the best color for the dog house bec ause darker colors absorb more heat when its warm or hot out. But white r eflects all of that heat energy
dark gray :: The reason that I selected dark gray as the o ptimal color for the doghouse is becauseout of all the colors, dark gray seemed to be the middle tempurature. This tempurature will affect the dog house by making it hotter in the winter when the sun shines on it, and c ooler then black in the summer, because it is a lighter shade than black. This will occur from the dark gray paint, because in the experiment, the use of the black lid made the air tempurature inside the jar an average of 53(DEG). The use of a white lid in the experiment made the air tempur ature inside the jar an average of 42(DEG). The use of a light gray lid made the air tempurature inside the jar an average of 45(DEG), and the u se of a dark gray lid made the air tempurature inside the jar 48(DEG). T his shows that dark gray is the middle tempurature, and ideal for a dogho use, because its tempurature was 6(DEG) hotter than the coolest tempurat ure, and 5(DEG) cooler then the hottest tempurature, making dark gray me dium in tempurature, and optimal for a dog house.
dark gray :: That color (dark gray) might affect the dog h ouse by absorbing heat cause it is a dark color,but not as dark black,so it won't absorb so munch heat.
white :: The best paint color for the dog house is whi te because the white color for the lid does not get as hot as the other c olor so itt wont be really hot inside the dog house. Acording to the Air Temperature BLACK average was 53 C(DEG) DARK GRAY average 48 C(DEG) LIG HT GRAY average 45 C(DEG) And the WHITE average 42 C(DEG)
white :: i picked white because it will make the dog h ouse colder even when the sun hits it
white ::  I would choose to paint the dog house white. The reason that I would paint the dog house white is because the inside o f the dog house would then be cooler, rather than if you were painting it black. The average air temperture when using white after 10 mintues was 42(DEG)C rather then when using black after 10 minutes it was 53(DEG)C . This has an overwhelming difference of 11(DEG)C after JUST 10 minutes
black ::  This color (black) will help the dog house stay/become warmer. Since the dog house is outside, and for the most part its pretty cold outside, the dog house should be black, so that the dog who lives in the dog house can stay warm. Black will do this the most because it absorbs energy better. After the 10 minutes, in the experiment, black was the darkest color and had an average temperature of 53 degrees Celcius. After the 10 minutes, in the experiment, white was the lightest color and had an average temperature of 42 degrees Celcius. So this proves that the darker the color, the more energy it will absorb, making the object warmer.
black :: the color will keep the dog house cooler in t he hot sumer
dark gray ::  dark gray because it will attrac enough heat to keep it warm in the dog house.
white :: I pick this color because its so bright.
dark gray ::  The color wuld keep the dog house at a even t empature but it wouldnt really matter because its not a closed system. th e jar had a lid so it left in heat ,but a dog house would let the heat ou t so the dog house is a open system.
white :: The tempreture inside the white doghouse will be much cooler then the air tempreture outside. Because in the experimen t, the results from all the testing showed that the white colored lid was much cooler the the rest of the colors used, so it would be more reasona ble to use the white colored paint to paint the doghouse.
light gray :: it will keep it warm in the winter but in the summer it would keep it cool because it is a light gray
black :: If they choose to paint the dog house black, it will affect it by absorbing more heat energy. In the investigation, th e average temperature for the black lid was 53(DEG)C versus the white wh ich had an average of 42(DEG)C. Therefore, if Brandi and Jerry paint t he dog house black, it will absorb more heat energy than the other colors .
light gray ::  The best paint color for the dog house would be light grey. This because the light grey would keep the dog house not a s hot during like the summer, and warm enough during the winter. From Bra ndi and Jerry's previous experiment, you can see with darker colors on th e lids like black and dark grey it made the jar temperature hotter so if you used it on the dog house it would make it too warm inside. With the l ight grey it would be not to hot or cold. Another choice would be the whi te but that might make the dog house to cold in the winter, so light grey is the best choice.
white ::  it asorb less heat
black :: the color would keep the dog house warmer bec use the average was 53 minutes after the light was turned off, so the dog would stay warmer compared to white which was only and average of 42 min utes after the light turned off.
light gray :: Light gray would be the best color for the do ghouse because it would not be too hot or too cold because in the expiram ent, the jar with light gray lid had an average temperature of 45(DEG)C after 10 minutes under the heat lamp which was not as cold as the white l id (42(DEG)C) and the light grey lid did not have as hot of an average a ir temperature after 10 minutes under the heat lamp as the dark gray lid (48(DEG)C) or the black lid which was 53(DEG)C. With the light grey roo f, the dog would not get too hot or too cold in it's doghouse.
white ::  It was the lid color that had the coolest tem perature. It was 42(DEG)C, 43(DEG)C, 41(DEG)C, and 42(DEG)C.
black :: The color black, might affect the inside of t he doghouse because the color black absorbs more energy compared to the o ther colors. I think this because in the data from the experiment, the av erage air temperature inside the glass jar after ten minutes for the lid color black was 53(DEG)C. The Dark gray lid colors average air temperatu re inside the glass jar after ten minutes was 48(DEG)C, the air temperat ure for light gray was 45(DEG)C, and the average air temperature for the lid color white was 42(DEG)C. Overall, the conclusion you could draw fr om that data is that the lid color black did absorb more energy than the other colors. In the experiment the black lid had a difference in average s from the coldest air temperature (the white lid) by 11(DEG)C.
light gray :: maybe something else was alredy that color
black ::  Black might affect it because the darker the color the the more energy it absorbs.
light gray :: they would choose light gray because they want the dog house to be the right tempature for the dog to stay in without being to hot and light gray is the perfect temapture for the dog.
white :: That color will effect the doghouse because t he doghouse will not be hot in the summer it will stay cool in the there.
black ::  black if you live in a cold place and want th e dog house to stay warm.
dark gray :: in winter the doghouse will stay warm in the summer the doghouse will stay cool.
black ::  In the summer the dog house will be hot but in the winter the dog house will be warmer becuse black attracts heat.
white ::  i choose white because if it was black,dark g ray, or light gray it will get hoter because of the density of hot ness.
dark gray :: Because dogs can only see light gray or dark gray and its more easyer for him to see his dog house?
black :: the color might affect the dog house because it is a dark color.....
dark gray :: I think that Brandi and Jerry should use dark grey for the dog house paint color.Dark grey would keep the temperature between the highest and the lowest temperature.Dark grey would be the bes t because the black dog house would get to hot for the dog at an average at 53(DEG)c and the white dog house would be to cold for the dog at an a verage of 42(DEG)c so i picked the dark grey dog house because it was in the middle at 48(DEG)c. The light grey house would be my next choise at an average of 45(DEG)c.The light grey and dark grey dog houses are only 3(DEG)c away from each other and i picked the dark grey because if it g ot colder the dog house would still stay warm enough for the dog.
black :: Black would be a good because it is a dark co lor and dark colors absorbe heat so when the dog house is made it will be warm for the dog.
white :: white
dark gray ::  Dark gray would be the best for the lids to m ake it sleeping light
light gray ::  light gray is not too cold but not too hot . Remember , most dogs have alot of hair on their bodys to keep them warm. &amp; so you dont want a dog house that gets too hot , like the black dog house , cause the sun obsorbs in darker colors. If a dog gets too col d in the dog house , provide blankets , food , &amp; water . For a health y envoirment. Also , if you see its a nice day outside , let the dog play aroud dont make it get cooped up inside .
white :: If you painted the dog house white, it would keep the dog cooler than if you were to paint the dog house black because the color black attracts heat more than the color white does, so if you painted it black, the dog would be really warm.
white ::  i choose white because black and grays suck in alot of heat and white reflects it so white is less hot.
light gray :: You'd probably want a light gray so that in t he summer the house is cool, and in the winter its warm
dark gray :: it wwould make the dog house a good temperatu re
light gray :: Light gray doesnt wont make the dog house, to o hot or too cold. The dog house would be both warm and cool down.
dark gray ::  Dark gray is best because the temperature sta ys the same
"white :: White has the least temperature on the data t able and it is the lightest color. Like their hypothesis said ""Darke r colors absorb more heat than lighter colors"". So white is the ligh test color there is. So that means that the white doghouse wont absorb an y heat like the black, dark gray, and light gray doghouses."
dark gray :: I would say dark gray because if it was cold it would keep the doghouse warm and if it was hot the doghouse wold be wa rm inside.
dark gray :: cause darker the color more it atracts heat
light gray ::  Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse li ght grey, because light grey absorbs more heat than white, but it absorbs less heat than black and dark grey. Light gray would be perfect, because during the summer, the light gray would absorb some heat but not alot, s o the doghouse would'nt be too warm. During the winter, the light gray wo uld absorb some heat so that the doghouse wont be too cold during the win ter. I know this because in the experiment that Brandi and Jerry did (whe re they found out how the color of an object affects its temperature) the y found that the average temperature of the glass jar with the black lid after 10 minutes was 53(DEG)C. The average temperature of the glass jar with the dark gray lid after 10 minutes was 48(DEG)C. The average temper ature of the glass jar with the light gray lid after 10 minutes was 45(DEG) C. Finnaly, the average temperature of the glass jar with the white lid after 1 0 minutes was 42(DEG)C. This shows that light gray absorbs some heat, bu t not alot, so Light gray would be the perfect color for a doghouse.
white :: If the color white is used on the dog house, it would reflect the suns light causing the inside of the dog house to be cooler than if it was painted with a darker colored paint.
white :: white would best fit the dog house because it helps the house cooled down then the dog woulnt be so hot or warm.
dark gray ::  The dark gray would be better for the dog hou se because its not to hot but not to cold. The black would be to ho t becuse the average was 53(DEG)c but the light gray and white are to cold with the light gray's average at 45(DEG)c and white at 42 (DEG)c. So in this case the dark gray is the right color fot the dog house with the average of 48(DEG)c.
black :: how hot it will get
white ::  I go with white because then the dog wont be as hot or cold in somedays because most of the trials were different.
white :: They Should Paint the Dog house White. If The Dog House Was whiteAnd It was a sunny day, then the dog would be hot.(do gs cant sweat.)
black :: Black will be a good color for the dog house because it attracts heat and it will kep the dog warm in its dog house. T he average temperature for the color black is 53 degrees and the average temperature for the lightest color, white, is 42 degrees, though black is better because it is a warmer color and the dog should rather be warm ra ther than cold.
dark gray ::  it will not make it too hot for the dog or to cold for the dog
white :: the darker the coler the hotter the air in th e dog house
white :: White would be a good color for the dog house because it doesn't absorb as much heat as black. This would make it cool er so the dog wouldn't be too hot
black :: If it is cold outside and there is still some sun, the color would absorb the sun, making the dog house a little warme r for the dog to stay in. Giving a dog a wamer atmosphere would be better to have it cold and freezing. Brandi and Jerry did an experiment wh ere they tested colors (black, dark gray, light gray &amp; white) and bla ck had an average of 53 degrees C. While comparing to the white which was 42 degrees C, that is 12 degrees apart from the black.
dark gray :: it would keep the doghouse warm but not to wa rm because dark gray is a dark color
white :: i think that white would effect the dog house because it had the lowest numbers in the data table
light gray :: The light gray color will keep the room bothe cool and warm at the same time
light gray ::  black absorbs more heat, therefore it will be too warm in the dog house, white on the other hand absorbs less heat as you can see on the data table. During trial 1 white was 42(DEG) while black was 54(DEG). So if the roof is white the dog will too cool. Therefore th e dog house should be light grey, it is a happy medium. On cool days it w ill still be warm because grey absorbs more heat than white, and on hot d ays it wont be too hot because grey absorbs less heat then black.
white :: the daog have fur and when it hot the white w ill reflect the heat from going inside and keep the dog cool in the exper iment the white got cool then the others
dark gray :: If Brandi and Jerry paint the doghouse dark gray, then when the dog would be inside the doghouse it would not be hot, but it would not be cold, either. From the investigation for the air temperature, the average of all the averages combined is 47. The closest color to that temperature is dark grey. Therefore, the color dark grey is just the right temperature because it's not too not, and not too cold. The dog inside the doghouse would be perfect in this temperature.
black ::  If the paint on the doghouse is black then the inside of the doghouse will be warmer. The air in the jar was always warmer when the black lid was on it. the dog will stay warm in a black doghouse.
dark gray ::  Dark gray would be the best paint color for the dog house because in all the trials the dark gray lid changed the air temperature in the jar to 48(DEG)C. The light gray lid change the air in the jar to 44(DEG)C in the first trial, 45(DEG)C in the second trial, and 46(DEG)C in the third trial. Dark gray would kepp the doghouse the s ame temperature where as the light grays temperature would vary.
white :: if you have a white houes les heat will be at racted to the houes because it is a lighter color but to a dlack houes mo re heat will be atracted
black ::  it will make the air inside the dog house war mer if the color is darker
light gray :: The color might affect the dog house becuase dark colors attrack sunlight so black would be hotteer then dark gray, wo uld be hotter then light gray, and light gray would be hotter then white. White would have the coldest tempature in the dog house and black would be the hottest.
white ::  white would be the best choice for the dog ho use because dark colors like black and dark gray absorb a lot of energy a nd it will be hotter, so therefor make a white doghouse and the dog would be in cooler temp
light gray ::  Well darker colors absorb more heat,making the dog house a lighter color will keep it cool,but also warm but not to warm
white :: white because, the jar with the white jar lid stayed the coolest and only got up to about 42(DEG)c. so the dog house would stay cooler if you painted it white.
black :: black will affect the dog house becouse black attracts the sun wich makes lots of heat and high temperature
black :: Becasue darker colors absorve more enrg y .
black :: black because dark colors absorb more energy
white :: because thee adrker the color of something th e more heat is attracted to it.
light gray :: Its the median tempurature from the experimen t, so the doghouse temurature would be able to stay warm in cold weather and cool in hot weather.
light gray :: The color will keep the dog warmer in the win ter, but won't make the dog house hot in the summer.
dark gray :: Using the dark gray paint would be best becau se it was closest to the average temperature of all of the colors. The do ghouse temperature would be warm, which is good for the winter and most s easons.
black ::  Black paint well keep the doghouse warmer because the black lid was avaraged 54(DEG)C ware as white paint was only 42(DEG)C. So there would be an avarge of about 12(DEG)C diffence b etween the white and black paint.
black ::  the darker the color, the more heat or light is absorbed making it warmer. and in the experiment black made the air of the jar the warmest. the heat from the top of the doghouse will heat up the doghouse
dark gray :: This color will effect the tempeture of the d og house because the tempeture doesnt change most of the time. the dark g ray color keeps the tempeture the same, and it keeps it nice and cool for the dog.
light gray ::  black is too dark and it will make the dog de peress and the white is too light it will be dirty so soon so gray color will not make it dirty soon and depress. it will make the dog hyper and m ore excited.
dark gray :: because it gives the inside of the doghouse a warm felling inside that would confret the dog
white ::  The color white would be the best choice when painting a doghouse because it would keep the dogs cooler on when inside than any of the other color choices. The average temperature when testing white paint in the experiment was 42(DEG) C. Which is 11(DEG)C cooler than if you would have chosen black paint which has an average of 53(DEG)C. Proving perfectly why choosing white paint is the best choice.
black :: it will make it absorb more enerrgy ,
dark gray ::  the color dark gray because it would keep the dog house cool for the dog because the average temp. was 48(DEG)
white :: The white will keep the doghouse cooler when it is hot outside. Since the temperature was lowest when the white lid wa s on the jar the temperature in the doghouse will be cooler with a white doghouse.
white :: Because it does'nt get as hot at black, dark grey, or light gray, the avrage for the white lid is 42(DEG)c, the avera ge for the black is 53(DEG)c, the average for the dark grey is 48(DEG)c , and the average for the light grey is 45(DEG)c so there for white is t he best color for the dog house because it doesnt get as hot as the other colors
white :: the inside of the dog house will be cooler be cause white had the lowest tempature. at 42 degrees celsius
white :: well dogs like light color so they will use i t more often.
white ::  White might be the best color for the doghous e because of its low heat intake. With the dog having long hair it wouldn't be the best decision to have aa black doghlouse where it would a lways get hot. So, with a white doghouse the dog could be more comfortabl e in a less hot doghouse.
dark gray ::  If Brandi and Jerry made a doghouse, the best color to paint it would be dark gray. Dark gray would be best because it absorbs heat so the dog won't be cold if it goes inside, but it isn't as dark as black so if the dog wants to be cooler, it can use the doghouse.
dark gray :: The dog house would not be too hot in the sum mer if you did a dark gray, also if you chose a light gray it could be co ld in the winter, so there for dark gray would be the best color.
"white :: The doghouse should be white because then the temperature inside the doghouse would not rise as much on a sunny day because accoring to experiment and the data table, ""Lid Color vs. Air Temperature,"" the glass jar with the white lid was the least affecte d by light. For example, the average temperature inside the glass jar with the white lid after ten minutes was 42(DEG)C, while the average temperature inside the glass jar with the black lid after ten minutes was 53(DEG) C."
white :: The color white may affect the dog house beca use during the summer it may reach high temperatures and the color white refflects the sun. Making the dog house less hot.
white :: the average air temperature of the jar with a white lid was 41(DEG)C. with the paint color as white the air temperatu re in the doghouse won't get as hot. With a black lid in the previous exp eriment the average air temperature was 53(DEG)C which is hotter than th e white lid by 12(DEG)C.
light gray ::  so it won't get to hot or too cold
white ::  It woulod affect the temperature inside of it .
white ::  because it is said to no contract heat or ab sorb
white :: i chose white cause it is the lightest color out of all fur of them and the other ones will just attract heat and the sun.
light gray :: it would affect the dog house by keeping it cool. A dog that is active and does a lot of running, the dog would not want to got to a doghouse that is painted black because that would attract a lot of heat to the point where the dog would stay too hot to cool off.
black :: it would keep the dog house warm becaus e the color will atract the heat wich will keep the house warm.
white ::  This color won't make the doghouse to hot, to the highest temperature. The temperature of the white doghouse will be just right on a dog, especially after more than 10 minutes.
dark gray :: According to the experiment, BLACK would be t he best and most effecient color (in the pretense that you would want it to be warm inside the doghouse, that is). But, the case is, during the summer, it gets very warm, and what happens if you paint the dog's house BLACK? Well, that col or magnifies the sun's heat, and you would indirectly scorch your poor do g. Usually, though, the heat here is cold and not hot, so the best color for the dog house would be DARK GRAY, because during the Summer and heat, your dog wouldn't be too h ot, and during the colder times, it will still keep the heat in well.
white :: If the color of the doghouse is white, this w ill keep the house cool. According to the experiment, the black lid incre ased the air temperature by 29(DEG)C in 10 minutes, while the white lid only increased it by 18(DEG)C.
dark gray :: The darker a color is the more heat energy it attracts, so the dark grey would attract not much heat energy to where its to hot, but it wont be to cold either.
dark gray :: I think dark gray would be the best color for the dog house because out of all the other colors, this was the only one with the same temperature throughout the trials. it wouldn't be too cold or too hot.
black :: The color may effect the dog house because it darker then any other other color
white :: white will keep the dog house cold.
white :: White would be the best color for the doghouse because the lighter the color is the less light it will attract.The reason black,dark grey,or light grey wouldn't work is in the table it shows for the averages, black is 53 and that is just to high,dark gray is 48 and that is also pretty warm,light gray is 45 and that is a little cooler th an the dark gray but noy much,and then it shows white,and white is 42 and that was the coolest of all the colrs bucause is attracted less heat.
white :: by painting the doghouse white it would make the doghouse cooler inside than painting it black dark gray or light gray because in the data it shows that the average temperature of the air in the jar that had the white lid was 42(DEG)c , and the average temprature for the air inside the jar that had the black lid was 53(DEG)c. by painting the doghouse white there would be a difference in heat of 11(DEG)c t han painting the doghouse black. therefore painting the doghouse white would be the best choice of color to paint the doghouse because it would keep it the coolist temperature.
white ::  If the doghouse is white, it will not become as hot as if it were painted black. The jar with the black lid had an average of 53(DEG)C under the lamp. However, the jar with the white lid had an average temperature of 42(DEG)C
black ::  I think the black paint would work best becau se it absorbed the most heat out of the four colors. The average temperat ure was 53 degrees which was five degrees higher than the dark gray, eigh t degrees higher than the light gray, and eleven degrees higher than the white paint.
dark gray :: Dark grey because, in the winter the dogf mig ht get cold soit would be warmish inside of the doghouse for the dog and in the summer the dog might not even go in its doghouse it will probably want to lay out in the sun but in the summer at night it is the perfect t empeture to sleep in the doghouse.
white :: the white paint would make the inside of the dog house cool and not hot becuse dark colors absorb more energy as said in the text and bright colors don't.
white ::  The white would make it cooler inside so in t he summer it wouldn't be hot
white ::  You should use white because the dog probibly has enough fur to last through winer so you would want to keep as much h eat out as possible during the summer-I say this because according to the test reasults the average air heat from black was 53(DEG)C, the average for dark gray was 48(DEG)C, The average for light gray was 45(DEG)C an d the average for white was 42(DEG)C. So in conclution the white paint i s 11(DEG)C cooler than black paint. -
white ::  White has the least air temperature (42) and so there will be less air temperature affecting on the doghouse.
black ::  black because the coloe might get lighter and then darker and then lighter and then darker, it will affect the doghous e because the house may become warm inside by the heat the black is bring to it
dark gray :: The dark gray will be a cooling and warming c olor for the doghouse. In all 3 trials it only got up to be 48(DEG) C an d the black got up to 54(DEG) C
white :: It affects the inside of the dog house becaus e if white is the color outside then on the inside it will be much cooler than black or d ark gray since darker colors aborb more heat.
light gray :: The color would affect the doghouse by not ge tting to hot in th summer and not getting to cold in the winter .
white :: the white whould not be hot so the dog can no t burn up. the temperatre was 42(DEG) and the hight was the black at 53(DEG) . the diffentcies would be 11(DEG).
black :: That color wil affect the doghouse warming th e inside of the doghose because in the data the color black was ranging i n from 52(DEG)C-54(DEG)C and the lighter colors were in the 40(DEG)C
light gray :: its best. its not that dark and that light.
white :: It will keep the Dog cooler in the summer. In each Test, the white lid was proven to stay the coolest, the data shows that white has the lowest temperatures at; 42 for trial 1, 43 for trial 2 , 41 for trial 3, and 42 for trial 4.
black ::  it was hotter outside
white ::  the white is not dark and not light, white is between that .
dark gray ::  Dark gary might affect the doghouse by keepin g it hot in the winter but not to hot in the summer
black :: The black will absorb more enery
light gray :: Its a lighter color and then it wont be that hot.
black ::  Black would be the best choice in colder clim ates (Washington) because it absorbs more heat. The dog would thusly be w armer if its doghouse was painted black. Inside the jars, blacks av erage temperature is 53(DEG)C, compared with white which's average tempe rature was 42(DEG)C. That is a difference of 11(DEG)C.
black ::  If you use the color black, then the inside o f the doghouse will have an increase in temperature. According to the exp eriment a Black lid had an average temperature of 53(DEG)C. While t he white lid had an average temperature of 42(DEG)C. Therefore I can conc lude that a darker color will cause an object to have a higher tempature. Which means a black doghouse will have a higher temperature then a white doghouse.
black ::  Black affects the doghouse because is gonna b e to dark and hes not gonnaq want to stay in ther.
white :: How the color white would effect the dog house is, if they painted it white it would be cooler inside the dog house. and if they painted it black it would be hotter. they should paint the dog house white so the affect makes the dog house cooler.
black :: In the experiment the black lid made the air hotter so to make the doghouse hot they should use the black lid for the lamp.
black ::  because in the winter the dog has a beter chance of staying warm
white ::  White will not affect the doghouse because th e sun will not go to the doghouse as black because black absoed more the energy so the godhouse will get hot as much as the coloer black.
white :: Having a white painted roof will reflect heat in the summer, so the dog will not overheat inside it.
white ::  Having a white colored doghouse will make the dog house cooler. This is because white is a color that doesn't absorb heat as well as other colors which will make the doghouse cooler and more comfertable for the dog. In the expiriment the air temperature inside the jar was 11(DEG)c cooler than the jar that was black which proves that painting the doghouse white will make the doghouse cooler.
black :: the sun will absorb the color black and the t emperature will rise
light gray :: this color would give the temperature a fresh breeze in the hot summer days &amp; the fall
black :: the dog would not be ale to see his house in the dark.
white ::  In this experiment, it proves that out of all the colors tested, White was the best. White stayed cooled the whole time, while others tempertures went up.
white :: I don't think the color on the outside would affect the inside of a doghouse if your using a thicker material like wood, but to be safe i would still choose white so the house would be colder
black :: Black will affect the dog house by making it hotter because the average temperature inside the dog house was 53(DEG) c. The white will will not make it as hot because it's average temperatur e was 42(DEG)c.
dark gray ::  I think that they should paint the dog house black because it absorbs more sunlight and allow the house to be warmer. The black had the highest temperture that was 54 degrees and the white on e had 41 degrees.
white ::  white, might make it colder in the winter tha n the spring ,black might it hot in the summer and winter the light gray as well
white ::  Since white is such a light color it doesnt a bsorb so much energy and it's cooler than the other colors. Cooler condit ions are best for a dog, in my opinion.
white :: the white paint will keep the dog warm but no t stifling hot. the paint had the lowest temp. of air in the lab as white doesn't attract heat like black does
white ::  White paint will affect the inside of the doghouse by making it cooler than it would be if the doghouse was a different color. In the experiment, the white color had the lowest temperature, after 10 minutes, and was 42(DEG)C. The light gray was 45(DEG)C, the dark gray was 48(DEG)C, and the black was 53(DEG)C. Since the white had the lowest temperature, it would keep the doghouse coolest, and therefore be the best to use.
light gray :: the light gray because than i wont get to hot in the doghouse when its sunny out side because it wont absorb to much e nergy, but when its cold outside it will still be a little warm because i t absorbing energy, so it would always be the perfect temperature for the dog
white ::  because the whit well not be as heated in the dog house unlike black because that welll heat the whole doghouse
white ::  Brandi and jerry should use white because it absorbs less heat than the darker colors.
dark gray :: The color might affect the doghouse by making the inside temmperature warmer than the temperature outside by more than it would if you used white, or light grey. because in the experiment, th e dark grey absorbed more heat, getting an average of 48 degrees C. compa red to light grey's 45 degrees and whites 42. Black absorbs more energy, at about 53 degrees C., but the dog might cook if its sitting in the dog house during the summer.
white :: because if u have a lighter color then the temperture would be colder
light gray :: I chose light grey because the inside of the dog house wouldn't be too hot for the dog, or too cold. According to the data, the result of light grey had an average temperature of 45(DEG) C w hile the black paint would be too hot at an average of &#8776; 53(DEG) C and the white paint could maybe be too cold with an average temperature of 42(DEG) C
light gray :: If darker colors absorb more heat, then I'm g uessing that that means it absorbs cold temperatures too. So to keep it a t an even balance, I would say the color light gray is the best choice.
black :: Painting the dog house black would make the a ir inside it warmer. In Brandi and Jerry's experiment, the average air te mperate of the can with a black lid was 53(DEG)C, whereas the dark gray was only 48(DEG)C, the light gray was only 45(DEG)C, and the white lid was only 42(DEG)C. Therefore, the black lid made the air the warmest so a doghouse painted black will have the warmest inner temperature.
white ::  If the color of the doghouse is white, then i t would be colder inside the dog house and when it is warm and sunny outs ide the dog in the doghouse will not get to hot. The results from the exp eriment support my desicion because in the experiment with a white lid th e temperature inside the glass jar was 42(DEG)C and all the other temper ature averages were a higher temperature than 42(DEG)C.
dark gray :: In the experiment, the dark gray lid made the air temperature inside the jar an average of 48(DEG)(c). If the doghous e was black the air temperature would be an average of 53(DEG)(c). If th e doghouse was white the average temperature would be 42(DEG)(c). If the doghouse was dark gray then the dog wouldn't be too hot or too cold.
black ::  It would affect it by making the dog house more warm when the sun is out. The reason I would use this color is because when its cold outside during the day, the black will absorb more energy from the sun and make it warmer for the dog.
black :: in the daytime the dog house will be warmer
white :: This color through off more heat than the res t of them.
white :: This color might affect the doghouse because the doghouse might stay cool for the dog and they wont burn up in the dar k colors.
light gray ::  During the summer, the doghouse will stay a l ot cooler than it would with it painted black, but in the winter, it woul d be better to have light gray so that the doghouse would be warmer.
white ::  i would choose white because you don't want t he dog to get too warm.
black :: that color might affect the dog house because it will keep the dogs warm at night in case of the cold air. for example if it was hot and i was wearing black i would be hot as well cause its a dark color and can affect my body teperature and the heat on me and in t he air.
light gray :: i dnt know
light gray :: It will asorb some heat into the dog house, s o that the dog could stay warm at most times.
white ::  If the doghouse was painted white, in the sum mer when it was very hot outside, then the dog would be able to go into t he doghouse where it would be cool inside. I know this because in the exp eriment the jar with the white lid had the coolest temperatures. The ligh ter the color, the cooler it will be inside.
dark gray :: it will make the doghouse cold and look dark even during the day.
black :: bacause its black
light gray ::  I chose light gray because then the dog house won't be too cold or too warm with light gray. Light gray was in the mid dle of the data. White would of been too cold for the dog but black would of been too hot. The average temperture for white was 42(DEG)C and the average temperture for black was 53(DEG)C. Light gray was the perfect ch oice because it's average temperture is 45(DEG)C.
white :: In the data table it shows The black lid Held in more hot air then all the other lids Black lid held in : 54 (DEG)c on trial 1 whi le the white lid held in : 42(DEG)c in the first trail the black lids average was 53(DEG)c while th e white lids average was 42(DEG)c by comapreing the data it shows that the whit e lid holds in less air.
white :: the best color to paint the dog house would b e white because it attracts the less heat in the trials the tempatures we re 42(DEG), 43(DEG), 41(DEG), and 42(DEG) which makes it the lowest t empatures out of all the colors
black ::  it might effect it,by using this color it can make the doghouse more warmer on summer days.
white ::  well when it gets hot in the summer the dog w ill be cooler and white goes with everything.
white :: white would reflect heat so the dog would not get verry hot
light gray :: they might not beabol to see the thing
dark gray :: that would help even it out.
"white :: White, because you want your dog to be cool e nough and according to the ""Lid color vs. Air tempature inside glass jar"" chart, white is the coolest."
dark gray ::  I think that the color dark grey will affect the doghouse by making it warmer but not too warm inside, than if it was a lighter or darker color. I think that because in the experiment the darkest color black ended up being the warmest at 53(DEG), dark grey was the second warmest at 48(DEG), light grey was next at 45(DEG), and white was least warmest at 42(DEG).
white :: I would paint the doghouse white because that color would keep the doghouse cool. In the experiment, the jar with the white lid was an average temperature of 42(DEG)C and the jar with the bl ack lid had an average temperature of 53(DEG)C.
white ::  They should make the dog house with a white r oof because that will keep the inside of the dog house cool, instead of e xtremely hot. In their experiment the average for a white lid was 42(DEG) C, as apposed to the black lid which had an average of 53(DEG)C. It would be a lot smarter to keep the inside of the doghouse cool by using white paint so the dog has some where to cool off, instead of using black paint so i t is very hot in the dog house and the dog will not want to be inside of the dog house at all.
black ::  because when is sunny the inside the doghouse is going to be so hot
dark gray :: I think dark gray is good because the t empeture is 48(DEG) and that's not hot so the dog is not going to be hot .And 48(DEG) is not cold either it's cool so the dog wont be cold or hot it'll be just right.But that's my opinion.
black :: If they were to paint the dog house black the n the dog would stay warm. As in the experiment it shows that when they used the b lack lid, the temperature went from 24(DEG)C to 53(DEG)C in 10 minutes. And when they used the white lid the tempurature went from 24(DEG)C to 42(DEG)C in 10 minutes. This showes that the darker the color, the great er increase in the air temperature, because the darker colors absorb more energy.
dark gray :: it would effect it because in the doghouse it wouldn't be too hot and it woul dn't be to cold.
white :: the color white would keep the dog house at a cooler temperature
dark gray :: How this color might affect the dog house is that with Black in the summer the dog house would get to hot inside, and with white in the winter time it would get to cold inside. I chose Dark Grey because it would not get to hot or to cold because of the weather.
black ::  black would affect the doghouse because if it was to hot the dog wouldnt have know where to go but the doghouse the the dog house would be extremely hot
dark gray :: Dark gray because that color doesnt absorb to much sun to make it hot and it doesnt absorb not enough sun to make it t o cold.It absorbs just the right amount of sun so that its not to hot and not to cold.
black :: blach dontueist nating
light gray :: Light Gray should be the cooler because in th e summer it wont be so hot because in the data the average temperature is 45 degress celcius so it's not to hot or to cold.
dark gray :: the color wont absorb to much heat therfore i t wont be to hot inside. the darker the color the greater the heat
white ::  You would want to paint it white beacuse white does not absorb as much heat as daker colors would, therefor; keeping the dog cooler in the summer time.
white :: In the trails, the white lid got the least ho t, so the dog house does not get to hot, they should paint it white.
black ::  It would have more air in the doghouse allowi ng the dog to breath easier.
white ::  reflect more heat to keep the inside cooler i n the sumer
black :: Black would change the temperature of the dog house by making it warmer beacause black absorbs heat to most. With the black lid the temperture was 53(DEG)C. With the white lid the temperature was 42(DEG)C. There was 11(DEG)C difference.
white :: i would say white because in the experiment t he darker the color the hotter it got. And with white being the lightest color the dog would not get as hot.
white :: Because dog likes to touch things so they mit e do something and make the lamp fall.
white :: it would be the color that would attract the least amount of heat
dark gray ::
black :: the color black will affect the dog house in many ways. for example, it will be warm in there when its sunny out side. the way that i know this is, the temp of the black lid is 54 digres then 52 digres then back to 54 digres so the average temp is 53 digres but fo r white the average temp was 42 so as you can see this is how the color o f the doghouse affects the temp it will be warm in the doghouse.
light gray ::  The color light gray would have to be the be st color to paint the doghouse. They wouldnt want to use black because si nce black is a dark color itll absorb more energy &amp; make the air temp erature rise high. So black wouldnt be a good color because they wouldnt want the dogs to get to hot. That is why i chose light gray because i thi nk its just righ to paint the doghouse. With light gray, the dogs wouldnt be to hot or too cold. They would be just right.
dark gray :: when it rains or gets cold the doghouse will be warm and if it hot our the dog can be in some shade
white :: it would make it cooler cause the color isnt dark.
light gray :: it is not too hot or too cold
dark gray :: It might affect the doghouse by adding heat , but not too much heat and the temperature will stay the same throught th e day when the sun hits on it . It would be a good coloring because you d ont want the dog to get too hot .
white :: The dog house would not get too hot in the su mmer because white doesn't attract as mutch heat from the sun.
black :: Black paint would make the inside of the doghouse the warmest of all the paint colors. In the experiment it shows that with a black lid on a glass jar, the air temperature will be 53 (DEG)C on average and with a white lid, the air temperature would be 42 (DEG)C on average. This shows that the black lid made the air warmer by 11(DEG)C and therefore black paint would make the inside of the doghouse the warmest.
white :: That color might help to keep the air tempera ture lower since lighter colors dont absorb as much energy as darker colo rs like black or gray. This was proven in the experiment because the aver age air temperature for white (42(DEG)) was lower than the average tempe rature for black and gray (45(DEG)- 53(DEG)).
light gray :: I think the best paint color is light gray be cause that way the temperature inside the doghouse will be warmer than th e outside, so it won't be too cold inside, but it won't be too hot like a black roof might cause it to be
black ::  so it would keep it warmer in the winter and warm in the soummer so the dog wouldent freeze at night
white :: A white doghouse would absorb less energy, an d its temperature would be cooler. In the experiment, the jar with the li ght, white lid had a lower temperature than the jar with the darkest, bla ck lid. A dog house painted white would therefore have a lower temperatur e, and the dog could use it to stay out of the sun, and cool in summer.
light gray :: that color will not effect the doghouse becau se the light gray will not be to cold or to hot the the doghouse and for the dog who is going to be there in the doghouse
black ::  The doghouse would be hotter because dark col ors (like black) abosorb heat.
"black ::  The color ""Black"" would be the best color for the roof of a dog house because according to the results from the experiment, the air temperature inside is higher compared to other co lors."
black :: black would be good for a doghouse roof becau se in brandi and jerrys trials black heats up the warmest with black at a n average of 53(DEG) and the onther three colors only in the fortie(DEG) range. so therefore if you have a darker roof the doghousewill be warmer for t he dog.
white ::  this color might affect the doghouse by keepi ng it cool inside for the dog when it gets to hot in the summer and wants to go somewere where its not so hot
white :: the best color to paint the dog house would b e white because in the experiment the white lid didn't get as hot a s the black lid. the black lid reached an average of 53(DEG)c, but the w hite lid only reached 42(DEG)c. also with a white piant on the dog house instead of being really hot the dog house will be very cool
black :: If the dog house was black it would attract m ore light from the sun to the dog house which would keep the dog warmer w hen its outside.
white :: if they use the white paint for the dog house then on the inside of the dog house it wont be as hot as if it were pain ted black or the two shades of gray. the shades of gray and the black pai nt caused the jar to at least get up to 45(DEG)C and at the most the jar got to 53(DEG)C so brandi and jerry would be best of using the white pa int for the dog house because in the experiment the jar only got to 42(DEG) C when they used the white lid.
dark gray ::  If the dog house is dark gray, then the house will absorb heat to keep the dog warm on cold nights but also not to muc h heat so that the dog stays cool on hot days, because the darker the col or the more heat that is absorbed. If the color is not completely black t hen not to much heat energy will be absorbed.
white ::  white because dogs like to be cool like how they are always panting they do that so the cool down so if it was black then the dog would be way to hot.
dark gray ::  By painting the doghouse dark gray, it would affect the inside of the house because it would keep it warm while not ov er heating it. However, if placed in an already warm outside temperature, the inside COULD in fact overheat. So a dark gray doghouse would be pref erable in a cooler enviroment.
light gray ::  The dog house would not be hot, but it would not be too cold either.
dark gray :: you want the doghouse to be hot but not too hot so dark grey is right in the middle
dark gray ::  Dark gray should keep the dog house a medium temprature that isn't too hot, or to cold.
light gray ::  Light gray would keep the doghouse warm so th e dog wont be cold but also at a reasonable temperature so that the dog wont be to hot.
black :: Black absorbes more heat energy, so the insid e of the dog house will stay warm if it has a light source (the sun). Thi s is proven when they had a black lid on the jar and it gained 53(DEG) w ith the light source being the heat source.
white ::  The colors affect the temperature of inside t he dog house because darker colors attract more heat than white. I chose white because it has the lowest average temperature of 42(DEG)c. The ave rage of black was 53.25(DEG)c, dark gray 48(DEG)c, light gray 45(DEG)c , and white 42(DEG)c. All of this data was from the experiment. The diff erence is 11.25(DEG)c from lowest average to higest average.
white :: If you paint it white it will attract less he at from the sun, and the dog will like it.....
black :: The color will affect how warm or cold the do g house is . Because the white would be 42(DEG) and black would be 53(DEG) .
light gray :: light gray won't affect the dog house in any way.
white :: i choose white because if it gets hot in the summer than the dog can over heat because they only swet on there nose an d paws
light gray :: Light gray holds the same temprature of 48(DEG) every time
white :: my dog like white
light gray :: Light Gray will keep the inside of the dog house cool, but not to cold, and will keep it at a medium temperature for the dog. The data shows tha the light gray jar's average temperature was 45(DEG) C, while the black jar was 53(DEG) C, and the white jar is 42(DEG) C. So the gray i think is the most comfortable temperature for the dog.
white ::  Because it had lowest temp after 10 minutes w hich is 42(DEG)C
white ::  The color white is the color that got the low est air tempature on the Lid color vs Air Tempature inside Glass Jar, so it would keep the doghouse the coolest inside so the dog would be most co mfortable.
white ::  The best paint color for the doghouse is white. This is because the color of white reflects heat while the color of black absorbs heat. The dog wouldn't want a hot sweaty dog house. After 10 minutes of heat from the lamp, the inside air in the black colored jar had an average temperature of 53(DEG)C. But the white colored jar had an average temperature of 42(DEG)C. The white colored doghouse is the best color for coolness instead of hot, moisty and sweaty.
dark gray :: this color would deflect heat but also keep t he inside warm.
light gray ::  it well keep it from getting to hot
white :: White is the color most likely perfered becau se the color white doesnt absorb the suns radiations so it doesnt heat up as hot as others would.
white :: painting the doghouse white will make the dog house absorb less heat, and the inside will stay cooler then if it were p ainted a darker color
black :: The color black might affect the doghouse by making it warmer than using a lighter color like white, because black had an average temp of 53 degrees, and the color white had an average temper ature of 42 degress. Making the temperature 11 degrees warmer.
white ::  If the dog house was painted white it would not get as hot on the inside on warm days. The average lowest temperature after 10 minutes a light was 42(DEG) with the white lid.
dark gray :: Darker colors absorb more energy.
dark gray :: The dog house would be warm because dark gray is in the middle of the temperature ranges when exposed to light and hea t.
white :: it'll make the dog house a lot more cooler be cuase the lighter the color the less heat is attracted to it by the sun.
white :: In the summer when its reqqally hot the white color will attract less heat therefore leaving the doghouse cooler.
white :: I woul'd choose white because, The tempeture is cooler the average coming in a 42(DEG)c and the other ones are hotter like Light Gray is 45(DEG)c and Dark Gray is 48(DEG) and, Black at 53(DEG) .So i would have choose the coolest(least hottest) one so the dog would not get hot
white :: using white as the color for the dog house ro of would be best beacuse the sun light isnt atracted to whight as it is b lack. so the dog will stay cool and not hot inside his house.
white :: The color white will affect the doghouse in a good way. The color white dosn't absorb as much heat as the other colors do. When they did the experiment the color white only got to 42(DEG) C while the color black got to 53(DEG) C. Also, white turned out to be the color that absorbed the least heat of only 42(DEG) C. Which means insid e the doghouse it will stay nice and cool because it does't absorb as mu ch heat as the other colors do.
light gray ::  Light gray because in the summer it will not ge ttoo hot and in the winter it will not get that cold.
white :: Because the dog house won't get too warm and dogs have fur on them therefore they would not want there doghouse to get to warm.
white :: White, because the white lid temputature only went up to 42(DEG)C. The other lid colors got a higher temputature, So I chose the one that had the least temputature.
dark gray :: it would make it cooler in the summer and war m in the winter
black :: it could make it to warm for the dog, it depends on the weather.
dark gray :: The dark gray would probably be best for the doghouse because it absorbs heat but it still leaves out heat so when it is hot out, the doghouse won't absorb to much heat.
dark gray :: I think that dark gray would be the best colo r to have on a dog hose because, the dark gray had a steady tepature on i t that wasnt to hot or to cold and if your a dog im sure you dont want to be cold at night and to hot during the day.
white ::  White would be the best color choice because in the experament white was the coolest color of an average of 42(DEG)C.
white :: The lighter the color, the cooler the dog hou se will be causeing it to be more comfertable.The white lid was an averag e of 42(DEG)C 3(DEG)C coller than the other lids
light gray ::  The color of the doghouse would keep it the right temperature, not to cold and not to warm.
white ::  becuase from there experiment the white lid d idnt get that much heatlike the others
white ::  The color will affect the doghouse because it will keep the doghouse colder. By painting the doghouse white the air temperature inside the doghouse will stay lower. Since white is a light color it will not absorb a lot of sun like the darker colors will.
black :: Painting the doghouse black would cause the t emperature to increase the most. In the experiment the average air temper ature in the glass with the black lid was 53(DEG)C, the glass with the d ark gray lid was 48(DEG)C, the glass with the light gray lid was 45(DEG) C and the glass with the white lid was 42(DEG)C. This proves that if Brandi an d Jerry wanted their doghouse to be warm they should use black paint. Oth erwise they should use white paint if they wanted a cooler doghouse.
black :: The black color would make the dog house warm er for the winter, so that the dog will stay warm.
dark gray :: it is the second high est and it should keep the dog house worm with out geting to hot
dark gray :: my opinion for light gray cause it seems like an avaerga tempeture out of the four collors so i thing that the dog won t get hot if the collor method works
white ::  Because white doesn't attarct as much heat an d therefore the dog would be a lot cooler in a white dog house than a bla ck one for example.
white ::  the color white will make it cooler in the do g house so the dog wont get hot with all the fur it has.
white :: White would be the smarter choice, because it reflects heat verses absorbing it. According to the data the jar with the white lid stayed the coolest inside. Having black roofing tiles would be smart as well, because during the day they would absorb heat and then at night when it cools down the doghouse is warm inside. Together these two colors would make a very comfortable house.
white ::  I chose the color white for the doghouse. Thi s is because if the darker the color, the greater increase in temperature , then I would want to choose the lightest color so that the temperature of the inside of the doghouse would be cooler than the colors light gray, dark gray and black. This would help the dog stay cooler and not get as hot in the summer. The darker the color, the greater increase in temperat ure is correct because the average temperature of the inside of the jar w ith the black lid was 53(DEG) C when the average temperature of the insi de of the jar with the white lid was 42(DEG) C. The white lid jar was 11 (DEG) cooler than the black lid jar.
black :: That color might affect the dog house because it will be really dark. And the tempeture will be really high.
dark gray ::  I chose this color for the doghouse because s ince the doghouse will be located outside, you dont want the dog to be co ld at night! All dogs do in the doghouse is sleep anyways. The experiment with different colors of lids proved it did have an effect on the air te mperature inside the jar. The darker the lid, the higher the temperature because darker colors absorbed more heat. Which is why I chose dark gray for the doghouse. So its not too warm for the dog, but if the dog gets ho t, it can always come ourside of the doghouse and sleep.
dark gray :: dark grey because the darker the color the hotter it gets and so if you use light gray its best because white is to cold black is to hot and light grey could be to cold also.
black :: it wont be as hot
light gray :: it can effect the ray of the sun
black :: i think it said the blacker the lid is the butter
white :: you would probably want to choose white becua se that is the color that will keep it the coolest inside the dogouse, wh en the sun is shinning it is usually warm outside, and the dog will want to use it to cool off, not to get even more hot.
white :: The color might affect the doghouse by keepin g it cool. In the experiment, white had the average of 42(DEG)C, as for black had an average of 53(DEG)C. Therefore, 42(white) is less than 53(b lack), so Brandi and Jerry should paint the doghouse white.
white :: The doghouse will be cooler and more comftera ble for the dog if it is white.
black :: black absorbs all colrs and the data table sh ow that the average for black paint is 53 degrees
white :: White was the lid color with the coolest temp erature after 10 minutes, painting the dog house white will keep the insi de of the doghouse cooler because white will reflect more of the sun's he at than say black paint. In other words the darker the color the more hea t it absorbs and transfers to the inside of the dog house. We want to kee p the dog house as cool as possible so that the dog doesn't over heat.
white ::  The color might effect the doghouse by making it the temperature lower.
dark gray :: I chose dark gray because it will keep warm i n side but also it will keep cool when needed, so if its hot out side it will be warm but not to hot and if it's cold out side it wiill be cool bu t also warm as well. I know this because with the dark gray average tempe rature was 48 (DEG)c wich was a preet good median considering the black average was 53 (DEG)c and the white average was 42 (DEG)c.
white ::  The color white would keep the dog house not as hot inside as the other colors, becasue white had the lowest temperature in the experiment. Whit had the lowest temperature average which was 42(DEG)C. Light gray's average was 45(DEG)C. Dark gray's average was 48(DEG)C. Black's average was 53(DEG)C. That shows us that white had the lowest temperature and will keep the dog house not as hot.
light gray ::  Brandi and Jerry should paint the dog house l ight gray. If the dog house is painted in light gray, the temperature ins ide the dog house would not be too hot or too cold. In the result shows t hat the air temperature with light gray lid is 45(DEG)C, with white it's 42(DEG)C, and with dark gray it's 48(DEG)C. Temperature with light gra y is warmer than white lid, but it's not too hot like the dark gray ones.
white ::  This color would be the best to pick to paint the dog house because white reflects the suns energy and dose not aborsob it like all the dark colors...see if you look on the data table it shows that the avarge temerature for each color was black = 53 dark gray =48 light gray =45 white = 42 as shown on the avrages of the differnt color s it shows that white dosnt obersever that much of the suns engergy and t hats why i think white should be what they choose.
black ::  it is warmer than other colors
white :: white because blakc would absorb alot of the sun thermal energy witch would over heat and dehydrate the dog, same with , dark gray, and light gray, white would be the best choice because white reflects light, as appose to absorbing it, making the inner tempature co oler and more comfordable for the dog.
light gray :: i choose light gray because it is not to cold anfd not to hot just right.If i choose a darker color it might get to ho t for the dog and if it is a really light color it will be to cold and wont ke3ep him warm.
white :: The color white is the best choice. It will keep the doghouse a cooler tempture. This is proven by the data gathered by the trials. According to the data the average air temperature of a black lid on a jar was 53(DEG) C. When the lid was changed the white the temperature droped to an average of 42(DEG) C. This proves that white would be a better temperature control factor.
black ::  Black would effect the dog house because it's a darker color and darker colors absorb heat which would make the dog ho use warmer inside. In the experiment when Brandi and Jerry put the black lid on ther jar the average temprature was53(DEG)c opposed to when they put thee white lid on the average temrature was only 42(DEG). In the end black would effect the doghouse by making it much warmer inside the dog house.
light gray :: Light gray will make the inside of the doghou se warm but not too hot, so in the winter a dog won't be cold but in summ er it won't be too hot either. 45(DEG)C is a good warm temperature and t he temperature inside the doghouse should remain that temperature unless the color is changed.
light gray ::  It wont get as much heat as black because dar k colors absorb more heat then other colors.
light gray :: light gray will keep the temperture of the d og house not to hot in the summer and not to cold in the winter. if the d og house was white it would have a temerture average of 42(DEG)C and if the dog house was black it would have an average temerture of 53(DEG)C a nd the dark gray would be to warm as well at 48(DEG)C
white :: Painting the dog house White would be very sm art if you didn't want your pet to over heat on those dreadfuly hot summe r days. Based on Brandi and Jerry's experiment the color Black gives off more 11(DEG)C opposed to the color White.
white ::  that color white will effect the heat because the light the color the less heat it will atract and so then the white w ill give off less heat and the dog will stay cool.
black :: Black paint would warm the inside of the dogh ouse more than the other colors. In the experiment, black heated up an av erage of 53(DEG)C, while the other colors were never increased more than 48(DEG)C. If it was cold outside, that color would warm the doghouse mo re because of the low albedo and high absorbtion of energy.
light gray :: Brandi and Jerry should paint the dog house a dark gray because you dont want a lot of energy in you dog house, it sho uld be calm and relaxing but you always want some energy.The dark gray wi ll make he dog feel more relaxed, because in the experiment it says that the darker colors absorb more energy than the lighter colors.
dark gray :: the dark gray color would absorbe more heat t han a white or light gray color, keeping the dog warmer, when the tempera ture is colder. But when the temperature is warmer outside it wont absorb e as much heat as the black would, keeping the dog cooler.
white ::  this color would keep the dog house colder th an the other colors because from the recorded data, black's average temperature was 53 degrees celcius when white's was only 42 degrees celc ius
white ::  WHite because It will make it a lot more cool temperature wise than if it were black because darker colors absorb a lo t more heat
white :: Will they would like the dog to stay warm in his dog house and white dosent allow that much air to come in
white ::  i would choose white because it attrackes les s heat to the dog house.
black :: it will effect it because the suns rays will heat it
black ::  it will make it very hot in the dog house
dark gray :: I choose dark gray because its not as hot as black but it isnt to cold like white. Its a perfect temperature for the d og in my opinion. It doesnt have to much heat but just right, its a relax ing amount of heat.
white ::  They should paint the dog house white because if they would of painted i tblack it would attract more heat into the ho use and white does not attract heat or the sun light.
white :: This might affect the inside of the dog house because darker colors absorb more energy from the sun, white would bring a minimum amount of heat.
black :: If you paint the dog house black the dog hous e would be a little bit warmer in the winter the only bad part is that in the summer it will be a little hot inside the dog house. I know this bec ause in the experement that brandi and jerry did it said that the jar wit h the black lid was the hotest.
dark gray :: Dark Gray would be a good color for a dog hou se because it will keep the dog house warm during the winter and during t he summer the dog will spend most of its time outside its house. the results in th e experiment were 48(DEG)C solid so that is a good temprature for a dog house. not too hot and not too cold.
black ::  If they would like the dog to stay warmer, th ey should chose black because on average, the black lid had a higher temp urature than the white lid.
light gray :: I choose light gray because it would be a nic e temperature. If the dog house was panted black the temperature would av erage 53(DEG) C. If it was dark gray the temperature would average 48(DEG) C. If the dog houyse was painted white then the temperature would average 42(DEG) C. But a light gray color would make the average tempurature a nice comfertable 45(DEG)C.
light gray :: it well make it lighter so the dog can see mo re better.
dark gray ::  I chose dark gray because this will result in the doghouse being warm but not really hot. It really depends on where t he people live and on the season. Dark gray (48(DEG) C) would be more su itable because it would be pretty hot during summer but not as hot as the black (53(DEG) C), but it also would be warm during the winter, so it's a compromise between the weather. The temperature used for explanation w as the average.
light gray :: I think that light gray would be the best col or because it absorbs enough light to make the dog warm, without getting it too hot. Black would make it too hot, and white would make it too cold .
black :: If you painted the dog house black, the insid e would be hot. Because according to the experiment the color black would make things hot. The average for the temperature was 53(DEG)c for black . The average for dark gray was 48(DEG)C and gray was 45(DEG)C. Also wh ite was 42(DEG)C. According to this data, black would make things hot.
white ::  having this colour will effect the dog house because light colours reflect heat, so if you paint the house white, then there wont as much heat on the walls, making the doghouse cooler. this i s shown by the fact that in the jar experement, black had the hottest dat a and white had the coolest.
light gray ::  light gray because it will not be to hot or c old
white :: if they used white the doghouse would be cold er inside then it would if the doghouse was black. the reason why it woul d be colder is because white reflects more sunlight than the color black. darker colors usally abosord more heat then lighter colors.
white ::  The darker the color, the greatest increase i n temperature because darker colors absorb more energy. The white would keep the doghouse's roof cool on a very sunny day, since the light color doesnt absorb energy as fast as the dark colors.
dark gray :: I chose dark gray because it would effect the dog house by not making the inside of it to hot or to cold. The average of the four averages was 47(DEG)c so i chose the closest one to 47(DEG) c and dark gray was 48(DEG)c so thats why i chose dark gray.
black ::  the balck kid brings in the hot air and holds it. good conductor
white ::  White because in the data it say that white had the lowest tempature with a average of 42(DEG)C. If the they painted it white, it would keep the dog house at a cooler tempature during hot sunny days.
"white :: White because black colors, dark colors attra cked heat towards them so if you get light color ""white"" the te mparture would be cooler in there."
white ::  the tempicher will still rise but less then t he other ones
white :: this might affect the doghouse because it will keep the doghouse cool inside during the summer.
white :: White had the lowest average temperature so it would be more relaxing for the dog.
black :: Black would be the best color to paint the do ghouse. One way we know that is, when we did the expiriment with the lid colors, black ended up with an average tempature of 53 degrees celcius, w hile white ended up with 42 degrees celcius. This proves that black absor bs the most heat. If we paint the doghouse black it will absorb much more heat than say a white doghouse.
white :: white dosn't obsorb light how ever black dose
dark gray :: Dark Gray will affect the doghouse by making it warm in the doghouse. Not to cold like white or light gray and not too hot like the black.
"black ::  The darker the color that more heat it absorbs from the sun, which would make the dog house much warmer. They said, ""becau se darker colors absorb more energy.""."
black :: black might affect the inside of the dog hous e because it will get really hot in the inside cause the sun will produce more heat on the darker color than the lighter colors.
light gray ::  it would make it to where then in the summer it wouldnt be tohot but in the winter it wouldnt be to cold
white ::  I would say that painting the dog house white would be the best option because white absorbs the leat amount of heat e nergy and since dog-houses are already small they are already hot and you don't want the dog to get overheated, plus dogs have lots of fur to keep them even warmer. If there is a chilly day in the winter, you can put a blanket inside to keep the dog warm, but I would say that altogether, whi te is the best choice.
light gray :: The color Brandi &amp; Jerry should choose sh ould be light grey because if it was too dark, then the house would get t o hot, but if it was too light, it would be more cooler then the black, b ut it would be very dirty.
white ::  If they choose white, then the increase in te mperature will be the lowest of all the colors.
dark gray :: The dark gray color would keep the dog house pretty cool during the summer, but also wouldn't be too cold during the w inter because the temperature was the same the whole time.
black :: black because it atracts sun and makes the do g house have more heat
white ::  If they paint the dog house black or any dark color the dog house would be way to hot for the dog because the dark colors absorbe more heat then light colors.
dark gray ::  Dark gray would probly be the best color because its not black and its not white in the winter it can get really cold and white attracts less heat but in the summer it might be okay but black in the summer might be to much heat so to even things out i think dark gray is okay.
black :: because the paint changes color thr hot ter it gets
white :: i say white because the dog house is already going to be simi warm inside without the paint. and with the white paint the dog house is already like 40(DEG). so the sun shining on the dog hou se that would put the dog house at 80(DEG) inside during the day. then a t night the dog house will be in the 60s somewhere
black :: The black paint will make the dog house warme r for the dog because the black lid on the jar aborbed the most heat, wit h the highest average temperature (53(DEG)C).
black ::  I think black would be the best paint color because it will make the doghouse warmer when the sun is shining down on the doghouse. The average temperature for the color black was 53 degrees while the white color was only 42 degrees. Therefore, black is the better color to paint the doghouse.
light gray ::  if the color was darker but not black it woul d keep the doghouse warmer but not making it to hot beacause like in the experiment it was warm but not hot!!
light gray ::  i chose light gray because the inside of the doghouse would be warm and the dogs fur would keep the dog warm in the wi nter.
white :: the white will affect the tempenture inside t he doghouse by making it cooler. the white absorbs less heat so it keeps more out of the doghouse allowing the dog to be more comfturable.
dark gray :: AHAHA WHY ARE ALL OF THESE QUESTIONS SOO FREA KEN HARD AHAHA
white ::  it will help keep the dog hose cool becus white atraks the least amont of heat
"black ::  the color mght affect the doghouse because brandi and jerry said that""darker colors absorb more energy (heat) "" so a darker colors will make sure the dog is warm ."
black :: The darker color absorbs more energy
dark gray :: Dark Grey! because its not too dark so that t he dog gets to hot in the summer time but its not like it reflects the he at in the winter so the dog and stay warm. The average temp was 48(DEG) C so it was about the middle of the not to hot and not too cold.
dark gray ::  I would use dark gray. The darker colors woul d keep the doghouse warmer. Black had an average of 53(DEG), whereas whi te had only 42(DEG). However, we must remember that a dog is a liv ing thing, and cannot overheat. Dark gray had an average of 48(DEG). Thi s is enough to keep the dog warm without iverheating said creature. So, i n conclusion, I've determined that dark gray is the most logical choice.
white :: I chose white because white would keep the do ghouse the coolest temperature. When they did the experiment, the black w as the hottest (53(DEG)c), the dark gray was in the middle (48(DEG)c), the light gray was also in the middle (45(DEG)c) and the white was the c oolest (42(DEG)c).
light gray :: light gray because its not to light and its n ot to dark
white :: It Was The Coolest With the Temp. Of 42(DEG) C. It would Be To Hot To Use Black Which Was 53(DEG)C. Inside The Jar.
white :: The color whit will keep the dog house coller , becuase the color whit deflects light better making the dog house cooler.
light gray :: it would not make the doghouse too hot or too cold for the dog.
white :: the lid color white could make a difference b etween the black lid. the tempurture could not be high so they must keep the temputure cool for the dog.
white :: its would make the temperature inside the dog house not as hot so the dog does not overheat
white ::  the color white might effect the dog house be cause it absorbs less sun light then black ,dark grey or light grey. what this would do is make it so it would not be to hot in the dog house
black :: i chose the black color becasue that if the d og likes it hot then this would be the right becasue when they see what c olor would be the hotes and the trials number are 54(DEG), 52(DEG), 53(DEG) ((DEG)c) and the average temp. is 53(DEG)c if the dog likes it hot in there
white :: Darker colors usually attract more light. By attracting more light, it usually makes things much warmer. So, if you ha ve the lightest color there is, then it would attract less light and make the doghouse cooler. According to the data, using a black lid made the j ar about 53 degrees, the dark gray made it about 48 degrees, the light gr ay made it 45 degrees, and the white was about 42 degrees. As you can see , the lightest color had the lowest temperature. So, by using the lightes t color, it would attract less heat so they should use the white paint.
black :: A dark color like black will affect the insid e of the doghouse because the darker the color, the greater the increase in air temperature because darker colors absorb more energy.
white ::  i would choose white,one reason why is because u wouldnt want your dog to be hot so no dark colors and in your experiment white came the color that didnt get as much heat as others did.
white :: The white color does not absorb as much energ y as black. In the doghouse the temperature will be about 42 (DEG)c when it is a sunny day.
dark gray ::  First, where ever you live if it's always war m i would paint it light colored. But if the area you live in is always c old i would paint it a dark color. My theory is, your dog is going to sta y warm if the weather is always warm. Your dog will be warm during the da y or night when your dog house is a dark color. The dark color is going t o attract the energy.
black ::  If the weather where Brandi and Jerry live is cold, if they painted the doghouse black, it would absorb more heat than dark grey, light grey, and white.
light gray ::  light grey would be good because it wouldnt g et hot in the sun and black would be bad becaus the sun would make it rea lly hot inside the dog house.
black :: If they paint the doghouse black, their dog w ill always stay warm, because the color black will give the most heat. I know this because the average temperature in their experiment was 53(DEG) C and the others were in the low forty's.
white :: this color might make the interior of the hou se cooler.
white :: This color will be best because when its hot outside, the doghouse will be cooler than if they painted it black or a d arker color.
black :: Black is a dark color so it will absorb more heat and make the dog house a hot temperature.
black :: dfg
dark gray ::  I think he wshould use the dark gray color to paint his house because, it will be kinda in the middle of the other tem petures. If they paint it white in the winter it might be colder because it does't attrack to much heat. If they pick black as the color it would be to hot in the summer because it attracks more heat. Light gray will ki nda be like if you paint it white. So I think you should paint it dark gray so that in summer it atracks some heat. And that in the winter it does too. So it would be even out in both summer and winter .
white :: white wont effect the dog house because white dosnt absorb that much heat so the dog wont get so hot and not be able t o use the dog house
dark gray :: if the dog house was painted black, the dog w ould get too hot in the summer time becuase the color black absorbs more energy. But if the dog house was painted white, the dog would be easily c old in the winter time because the color whit absorbs less energy. In con clusion, painting the dog house dark gray will attract the right amount o f energy for the dog.
white ::  Because white reflects off the sun so it woul d keep the dog cooler instead of having a black roof that absorbs light a nd would keep the dog very hot.
black :: I believe that the dog house should be painte d black because it can keep the dog house warm during the winter. The dat a shows that the inside of the glass jar was 53(DEG)C when the black lid was used. Using the black lid proved to have the highest tempreture in t he glass jar. A disadvantage would be that in the summer the dog house wi ll be too hot, but as for the winter the black is the correct choice.
white :: The lighter the color the lower the temperatu re. The average temperature of the black lid after just 10 minutes was 53 (DEG), the average temperature for the dark gray lid after 10 minutes wa s 48(DEG), the average temperature for the light gray lid after 10 minut es was 45(DEG), and the average temperature for the white lid after just 10 minutes was 42(DEG). Therefore a light gray and white paint would be best to keep the doghouse cool because it heats up slower then the other colors. But if you were to use black or dark gray, it would keep the dog house warmer.
"white ::  The color of the dog house should be white because if you chooose darker colors, then the dog house will get too hot a nd your dog will be hot aswell. As the study shown, the color black had a n average of heating up to 53 degrees Celcius and had a difference of 11 degrees celcious than white color did. Same as the color black, dark gray will also be too hot if they painted the dog house dark gray because the color ""Dark gray"" had an average of 48 degrees celcious and was 6 degrees hotter than white. Also in the study, the color light g ray got an average of 45 degrees celcious and had a difference of 3 degr ees celcious hotter than the color white. The best color that Brandi and Jerry should paint for their dog house would have to be the color White b ecause the color white had a cooler tempeture than all the rest of the colors because in the experiment they made, t he avergae degrees in celcious for White was 42 degrees celcious and if t hey paint their dog house this color, the dog house wouldnt get hot nor y our dog."
white :: This might affect th dog house by making it c ooler in there intead of really hot all the time.
black ::  Blacks paint color would cause the inside of the doghouse to be warmer than the rest of the colors. This is because bl ack absorbs the most amount oi\f colors over every other color. To prove this in Brandi and Jerry's experiment black kept the temperature of the j ar warmer than all the rest. It was 6(DEG)C warmer than gray, 10(DEG)C warmer than light gray, and 12 (DEG)warmer than white. This clearly show s that black would keep the doghouse warm.
dark gray :: During the winter, Brandi and Jerry's dog will stay nice and warm, but not to warm, when summer comes.
white ::  It could get dirty, you could piant it over agia,and you could draw on the walls.
black :: The dark paint color is better because the gr eater the increase in air temprature in the doghouse ,becouse darker colo r absorbs more energy.
white :: If brandi and jerry use the color white for t he dog house the dog will not over heat because the color white does not attract the heat as much as the darker colors so the dog house would be m uch cooler.
black ::  cuz black is UGLY just like robert patteson
white :: white will keep the doghouse at a lower tempe rture because in the table it averaged 42(DEG). and black averged 53.25(DEG) so to have a cooler dog house paint it white.
white ::  While using white for the dog house the dog h ouse would be alot cooler then the other colors because the data shows th at the color white did not get as hot as the other colors did. That way t he dog would not be so hot in its house.
black :: Black because in the eperiment black was the one that had the highest tempature so the darker the color was the higer the tepature was.
dark gray ::  I would choose dark gray because it doesn't a ttract a ton of light. Which means the dog won't get to hot. But also bec ause it does attract some light which allows it stay warm.
black :: the color black would affect the dog house by keeping it warmest because dark colors absorb light and turn it into heat.
white ::  White is the best color for the doghouse because it absorbs less energy then black paint would. And then the doghouse wouldn't be too hot for the dog.
white :: Having the doghouse painted white will affect the doghouse by making it absorb less heat causing the doghouse to be co ol inside during the summer. Because in the expirement the black lids ave rage temperature was 53(DEG) and the white lids average temperature was 42(DEG), That`s a 11(DEG) difference. So painting the doghouse white wo uld be the best decision of paint.
light gray :: Light gray because it won't be too hot diring the summer, also wont be to cold in the winter.
white ::  it won't be so hot inside and it will stay co ol
dark gray :: This will keep the dog warm but it wont get to hot or cold.
dark gray ::  i picked dark gray because it stays the same temperature and in the data table it stayed the same temperature.
white :: because if the dog uses it in the summer it w ill be cooler then a black dog house
white :: its all about all the colors ha thats sick i could tipe now so how u bin good me im good to ya peace $$$$$$$
black ::  black would be a good color because dark colo rs absorb more energy and it would be more confortable.
dark gray :: I think it would be a good color for the dog house
white ::  white will effect the dog house.first this wi ll effect it because white will make it cooler in the summer,because whit e doesnt absorb very much heat.
black :: Black absorbs light. Just like with the jar l id when it was black, it absorbed the most. So if you colored the doghous e black it would increase the temperature inside it.
black ::  They should paint the doghouse black because black will help keep the dog warm at night and during the winter when it gets cold.When they used the black lid it made it warm at an average of 5 3(DEG)C,copmared to when they used a white lid that only made it warm at an average of 42(DEG)C.Thats a difference of 11(DEG)C.
white ::  Because light colors are the coolest in the summer time so with white being the lightest one white would work best.
white :: it will make it be cooler in the dog house
white :: the color white for the color of the doghouse would keep the doghouse nice and cool, as shown in the table from the sc enario when the glass jar with the white lid had an average temperature o f 42(DEG) compared to the glass jar with the black lid's average tempera ture of 53(DEG).
light gray :: light gray cause this will give the dog house some darkness but also bright, so the dog will be able to stay cool and can sleep.
white :: I chose white becauseit was the color that ab sorbed less heat
black ::  if brandi and jerry painted the dog house black then the dog house would be warmer because the darker the color is the energy the dog house can absorb.
dark gray :: It might make the doghouse warmer during wint er months. For example the average heat for the dark grey paint was 48(DEG)C
"black :: Since black is the darkest color of all the o ther colors (Dark gray, light gray, and white), because of the theory tha t darker colors absorbs more energy (heat); the inside of the doghouse wi ll be warmer as of the doghouse being painted the other colors. The proof that black would be the best paint color for the doghouse is because bla ck is the darkest of all the other colors, and darker colors absorbs more energy, also if you look at the data table for the ""Lid color vs. A ir temperature inside glass jar"" experiment, the average temperature for all 4 colors was black being the highest with 53(DEG)C, Dark Gray b eing 48(DEG)C, Light Gray being 45(DEG)C, and White being 42(DEG)C. Th erefore, black would be the best paint color for the doghouse."
white ::  its obsorves less energy from the sun than al l the darker colors
light gray :: the inside wont be too hot nor too cold
white :: it will make the avreag tempecher go down by 11 degrees
dark gray ::  I think dark grey would be the best one becau se it stays at the same temperture every trial . Also it would be the bes t one because it affect the dog house as much as the others because it st ays at the same constant temperture of 48(DEG)c so that color on the dog house would be realiable.
black :: The black paint color would help make the dog house warmer during winter and insolate it better. In the experiment the black lid had the best insolation because it started at 24(DEG)C and en ded at 53(DEG)C on average. It was by far the best lid.
black :: The color my affect the dog house because the dog might not be the same color as the house or the house will be to dar k because its black.
black ::  Painting the dog house black (darker colors a bsorb more light) would attract more thermal energy, making the dog house nice and warm for those rainy Washington nights.
white :: white because it doesnt absorbe light it refl ects it so thier for the in side of the dog house is not going to hot. Bu t if you use black the in side of the dog house is going to be very hot b ecause black absorbs light.
dark gray :: it would keep it warm in the dog house
white :: black and gray obsorb the color $
black ::  If Brandy and Jerry pick paint their dog hous e black then the dogs will get very hot in the doghouse because black abs orbs the most energy. As a result, painting the dog house black with attr act the sun and make the dogs misserable.
light gray ::  Light gray would be best so that it keeps the inside warm but not too hot. in the lamp expirement it was the 2nd coolest color.
black ::  the color will affeect the doghouse because i t will be less hot iin the dog house and black reflects sunlight.
white :: This color will make the air in the doghouse less hot, so the dog will be a lot cooler while in the doghouse. I know t his because in the experiment the air is hottest with a black lid and coo lest with a white one. So if the sun is beating down on the doghouse, it will only reach about 42(DEG) C, instead of 45(DEG) C or higher.
white :: Color will affect the doghouse because if the house is painted black it will get very hot inside but if it is white it will say cool allowing for the dog to be comftrable in side
white ::  The shade white will make the dog house coole r inside because the shade white does not absorb as much light energy as the shade black. I know this because in Brandi and Jerry's experiment, t he air temperature inside the jar with the black lid was an average of 53(DEG) C, and the average temperature of the jar with the white lid was 42(DEG) C. But I'd like to point out that Black and white aren't colors, they're shades. Get it rig ht.
white :: The color white would best suit the doghouse because the color white does not attract very much heat energy so that wa y the inside of the doghouse will not be over heated.
white :: White affects the dog house temperature becau se it has less heat obsorbing in it.
dark gray :: the dark gray with make the house be warm not to coldnor to hot. the data shows that the dark gray is always 48(DEG)C so you dont have to worry about the temperature getting clder ar hotter.
white :: If you paint the entire doghouse white then i t will appear to be lighter inside.
white ::  It will make it for inside of the dog house it wont ne so hot because this is the color that reflects light.
white ::  White will cool down the dog house because it is a lighter color.
white :: It will affect it by making it cooler than wh at the black would be if it were to be directly hit by the sun. The black lid had an average of 53(DEG)c and the white lid had an average of 42(DEG)c therefore the white lid will keed their dog cooler in the sun.
white ::  I believe that if Bbrandi and Jerry pai n the dog house white it would stay the coldest for the dog. Evidence shows that the darker t he color the more hot it gets, for exsample the average temperature for b lack is 53(DEG), the average temperature for Dark gray is 48(DEG), the average tempertaure for light gray is 45 (DEG). The white color of lid was the lightest of them all and had the smallest temperature 42(DEG) . I sugest painting the dog house white.
white :: The color white would affect the dog house in many good ways. one way is it wouldn't be so hot in the dog house and th e dog would enjoy being in it. The data table shows the temperature throu gh a three way trial. the average temperature is 42(DEG)c which is alot cooler and fresh then the color temperatures .
dark gray ::  it will stay the same even after it drys. :)
black :: it will make the inside of the doghouse warme r for the dog because dark colors obsorb more heat then light color s as shown in the investigation.
white ::  it would be best to paint the dog house white because it won't make the dog house as hot when the sun comes out. White won't attract as much heat inside the dog house, as we discovered in the experiment, white had the lowest temperature because it is a lighter col or. As the colors got darker, the temperature got hotter.
white :: The lightest color attracts less heat.
light gray ::  It would keep the doghouse cool but it would also give it some warmth so it wouldnt be cold all the time
white :: i think that the white will affect the dog ho use because the sun will shine in and melt it
black ::  i would chooose black for my dog's house brco use during the winters the dog house would need all the heat it could get so i would choose black. black is the best color to choose becouse in th e test it was an average of 11(DEG)c hotter!
white :: WHite dosent absorb much energy compared to b lack. black absorbs the energy like crazy
light gray :: Light gray because it wouldnt make it to hot in the dog house so ur dog could sleep comfurabley
black ::  I chose the paint color black because this co lor would cause the doghouse to be warm all the time. Even on a cloudy or rainy day, Brandi and Jerry's doghouse would be warm inside because the black paint would absorb the sunlight that was still radiating from the s un. After 10 minutes of heating the glass jar with the black lid, the air 's average temperature raised 29(DEG) C from the starting temperature of 24(DEG) C to result in an average air temperature after 10 minutes of 5 3(DEG) C. The glass jar with the white lid's average air temperature rai sed only 18(DEG) C from the starting temperature of 24(DEG) C to result in an average air temperature after 10 minutes of 42(DEG) C. The differ ence between the two average temperatures for the glass jar with the blac k lid and the glass jar with the white lid was 10(DEG) C. This means tha t the darker the color on an object, the more heat energy the color absor bs, causing the air temperature within the object to be highest compared to any color lighter than it. Therefore, Brandi and Jerry should paint th eir doghouse black due to the high amount of thermal energy that the colo r absorbs.
black :: Because the temperature will be high and not low . Painting it black is the highest temperature
white :: I choise white because white would keep the d oghouse cool in the summer.
white ::  the white had the lowest temp. in the jar so if you paint the doghouse white then it wouldnt be as warm.
white :: white duns not atat so mush heat
white ::  White would make the doghouse the least temperature.The data showed that the temperature was on average 42(DEG)C. The doghouse would be a cool enviroment, instead of too hot. The doghouse would be a place for the dog to go when he is too hot.
white :: white will make the dog house cooler so its m ore comferable in hot weather.
light gray :: IT will affect it because it will absorb less heat
white :: Barndi and Jerry should choose to paint their doghouse white because it collects less energy from the sun, causing it to be a cooler temperature which is more resonable.
white :: White will not absorb so much heat than the o thers.
light gray :: The color light grey is best for the dog hous e because it does not attract a lot of heat so the dog will not over heat but it wil not freeze.
white :: The color white Absorbs the least amount of e nergy, so by coloring the doghouse white it will ensure the dog house is a more comfortable temperature for the dog.
dark gray :: Dark gray would be a good color for the dogho use so that the dog doesn't overheat or get too cold. The house would sta y cool in the summer and warm in the winter. Dark gray had an average tem perature of 48(DEG)C while black had an average temperature of 53(DEG)C and white had an average temperature of 42(DEG)C.
black ::  if you choose a black color for your dog hous e the tempature would be warmer than if you used a white color, because t he air inside the jar with the black lid was warmer than the lighter colo rs
light gray :: it will keep the dog cool in the summer and w arm in the winter.
white ::  The lighter the color, the less air temperature. The white lid color has an average of 42(DEG) C. The black lid color has an average of 53(DEG) C. The white lid color has 11(DEG) C less heat energy than the black lid color. Therefore, If Brandi and Jerry are designing a doghouse for the summer, then they should use the color white since it' ll be cooler... Vise versa, if they are going to build a house made for a colder weather, then they should use black since it absorbs more heat than any other color. The darker the color, the more heat.
black :: This color (black) may effect the inside of t he doghouse by making the inside of the doghouse warmer. I say this becau se in the experiment with the lid colors the black lid made the inside of the jar warmer than all of the other jars. So, I'd pick the color black if you live in a cold climate, because the black color will absorb the th e light and make the dog warmer.
white ::  white because white has the least heat drawn to it then all the other colors so your dog would be way cooler and in be tter shape in a white dog house then any others.
dark gray :: dark gray should work just fine beacause its a little warm but not to hot and dogs like it a little warm so it would b e perfect for your dog
white :: the color will keep the doghouse more cold in the summer.
white ::  it wont be as hot as the other paints would l et heat in it shows that white was cooler than the others in there experi ment of lid colors heating up under a lamp
light gray :: the color of the dohouse should be light gray ,because if the dog house is black its going be very hot inside the dog h ouse in the summer and light gray would be an ok temperature an ave rage of 45(DEG)c for the summer and da winter, and every other seson
white :: white would make the doghouse less hot on a s unny day making it a place where the dog can cool down.
white ::  If Brandi and Jerry paint the doghouse white, than the inside of the doghouse will stay cooler than if they painted it black or gray. The average temperature for white was 42(DEG) C, while t he average temperature for black was 53(DEG) C. The difference of the tw o was 11(DEG) C, so this proves that white would be the best color to ch oose.
white ::  It will keep the doghouse the coolest, avearg e for white was 42(DEG) C, which would keep the dog from overheating.
white ::  If the color is white it will be more cooler than a black dog house, because black dog houses get hoter and faster, th an white dog house. If it was white it would stay around 40(DEG) instead of 44(DEG) ,48(DEG) ,and 55(DEG).
white :: The color of the doghouse is white becuase it brings out the color of the dog if its black, brown.
white :: That will affect the doghouse becuase that wa y there wont be to much pressure in the dog house. Then the dog wil l be comfortable
white :: it would make it cooler on the inside
white ::  If the doghouse is painted white then it will keep the inside of the doghouse colder. In the experiment black paint ma de the air temperature inside the jar have an average of 53(DEG)C and the white paint had an average air temperature inside the jar o f 42(DEG)C.
dark gray :: i would go with dark gray, so that way it doe sn't attract lots of heat. But just enough heat so that way it stays warm inside, but not really warm.
black :: I chose black, because the dog might want to stay outside anyway during the summer and lay in the shade or run through water-sprinklers; and in the winter, the doghouse would stay warm enough for the dog to sleep comfortably inside (the energy from the sun would heat the roof which would heat up the doghouse).
dark gray ::  i choose bark gray becase it the best colore for a dog house becase its not to hot and not to cold for the dog and th e average is if you choosed black than ill be to hot and if you choosed w hit it be to cold.
black ::  The black lid will attract more heat to the d og house.
white :: because that color stayed the coolest on the jar
"dark gray :: The color will keep the dog house warm but not to warm. The reason I know this is because in the expi rament ""Hot lamp"" the dark gray lid allowed the temperature to rise an average of 48 degrees. which was warmer than the 45 and 42 degree average of the Li ght gray and white but cooler than the average of the black lid whi ch was 53(DEG)C"
dark gray :: The dark grey will make it so it isnt to hott in the dogg house or 2 cold in the dogg house.
white :: The lighter the color, the cooler the dog wil l be. When the lid color was at it's darkest (black) the average temperat ure was 53 degrees celcius. When the lid color was at it's lightest (whit e) the average temperature was 42 degrees celcius. If Brandi and Jerry wa nt to keep their dog cool, they should use white paint.
white :: Cause for each trail and avrage. It is the lo west tepature.
black ::  i chose black because it was the color that kept the jar the hottest degree C(DEG).
white ::  tha color will atract so much heat
black ::  the darker a color is the more heat it takes in, with the dog house painted black it will absorb more heat rather than if it was painted white which reflects heat. in the experiment when the glass jar had the black lid the tempurature was 11(DEG) higher than when the jar had the white lid, this proves that darker colors absorb more he at and that brighter colors reflecxt more heat.
light gray :: The color light gray will be the best choice because on average the air tempurature stayed at an average of 45(DEG) C . So from the data you can tell that the color trys to accumilate to the weather. Also it won't be too hot or too cold for the dog to stay in.
light gray ::  The color will make sure the inside doesn't g et too hot or too cold.
white :: If the dog house is white then it will be coo ler in the dog house for the dog.
black :: I will keep the dog warmer at night and durin g winter when its cold.
white ::  It should be white so that on sunny days the dog will have a slightly colder dog house than if it was a darker color.
dark gray ::  dark gray will effect the doghouse tempature because the air in the doghouse will stay the same all the time.
black :: It would keep the dog house warm, because darker colors absorb more energy
dark gray ::  beause he well feel bad and dont like it and he wont sleep.
dark gray ::  This color is not to cold or to hot, it is ar ound normal temperature. After 10 minutes it should be around the same te mperature and if the growth in temperature continued it could get warm on cool days
black :: the color black will affect the inside of the dog house by the out side where the sun hits will affect the in sid e by makeing it hot.
white :: Keeps the doghouse cool and does not over hea t
dark gray :: This color can affect the doghouse by keeping an even temperature year round, so the dog house won't get to hot or too cold for the dog. The dark gray lid kept the same temperature the entire test, giving me a conclusion that the dark gray color gives an even temp erature.
white ::  The paint color that would be best for the doghouse is white.White is the best color to use because it would keep the inside of the doghouse cool during the day, so that way the dog inside of the doghouse doesn't get overheated. I know that white would keep the inside of the doghouse at the lowest temperature because of what the data table shows, which is that the color white's average temperature from being under the lamp for ten minutes was 42(DEG)C which was the lowest average temperature while the color black's average temperature was 53(DEG)C which was the highest temperature (which would cause the doghouse to get exteremely hot during the day, and that would be bad for the dog). So that is why white would be the best paint color for the doghouse.
dark gray ::  I think that if you choose a color to dark, then it might make the dog really hot, so I would choose dark gray because it won't very hot or very cold. Dark gray has trials that are 48(DEG) C which is hot. However, it is not as hot as the color of black with the highest temperture of 54(DEG) and it's also not as cold as the color of white with the lowest temperture of 41(DEG). So Dark gray would be a good color for a dog house.
white ::  if they were to paint the doghouse then they would want to use white becuse that is the one with the less tempa ture, average tempature was 42(DEG)c for white,unlike the black were tha t is the hottest one there is average tempature was 53(DEG)c. if they wa nt cool for the doghouse then use the white.
black :: Black will affect the dog house becuse black fades when it's in the sun. The color will change lighter.
white :: because the white will not atract that much h eat like the other colors.
white :: because white does not obsorb as much heat as black, the dog house will be cooler. the white lid reached an aver age teperature of 42 dagrees c as suppose to 53 for the black one.
white :: In the experiment, the white lid kept the tem perature in the glass the coolest. So if Brandi and Jerry paint the dogho use white, itll keep the inside cool for the dog.
black :: The darker the paint the the greater the incr ease in air tempurature in the dog house, because dark colors absorb more energy.
light gray :: Different color affect the doghouse color aff ect the heat in the doghouse
black ::  The black color might effect the doghouse by increasing the temperature of the house. In the expirament the average temperature for the black was 53 degrees celcius. For the lowest color, white, it was 42 degrees celcius. This means that the black was 11 celcius warmer than the white and proves that the black colored doghouse would warm up t he house.
white ::  the white color will keep the dog house cool and not hot. I know this because from the data the white lid was the cold est and the darker the lid was the hotter the inside of the jar was.
white ::  If the dog house is white it will be colder i n the dog house because if the house is to hot the dog will not want to b e in it
white :: the white will absorbe less heat and the dog house will be cooler or less hot. in the experiment black which was the d arkest had an average of 53degrees celcius and the white (the lightest co lor) had an average heat of 42 degrees celsius
white :: the color white would reflect the suns rays a nd keep the dog house cool.
light gray :: Light gray because the dog will probably want to be cool and not hot.
white :: Assuming that Brandi and Jerry live in a warm climate, a white doghouse would be the better choice. This is because wh ite absorbs less heat, so a white doghouse would stay cooler and keep the dog cooler.
black :: Black would be the best color because black e ntends to absorb heat (Thermal Energy). so the dogs house woud be warmer but the rest of the colors wouldnt be as good because anything that is li ght as in the color white it will reflect heat/thermal energy.
dark gray :: I picked Dark grey because it will be consistantly 48(DEG)c i know because in the table For each trial it was 48(DEG)c.
light gray :: Light gray would keep the inside of the dogho use from becoming to hot, and it would still be a better color than white for cold nights. This is true because the average temperature for the bl ack lid was 53(DEG)C, the average temperature for the dark gray lid was 48(DEG)C, the average temperature for the light gray lid was 45(DEG)C, and the average temperature for the white lid was 42(DEG)C
white :: If you were to build a dog house you wouldn't want it to get to hot, so I would choose white. The average was 42(DEG) C, since it was the coolest of the jars I think it would be best for the dog house.
white :: The color white in the experiment showed that it had the lowest air temperature. This color would affect the inside of the doghouse by making it more cooler so that the dog wouldn't be so hot in the doghouse.
black :: the color can effect the dog house because if the dog house is a dark color and its hot out side there will be more en ergy.
white ::  The average temperature shows that using whit e paint for the dog house will be the best choice for keeping the dog coo l.
white ::  White would be the coolest doghouse paint color they could choose because it takes longer to get really hot, unlike the other colors which got hot really fast.
dark gray ::  the color will effect the dog house because i f it is black it will be hotter because it atracts more heat but if its w hite then it will atracts less heat.
white ::  The white will keep the dog cooler in the sum mer and it is ok for the winter too. The black the dog would over heat be cause the average is 53(DEG)C, but the white is 42(DEG)C which is ok for the winter and the summer.
black :: make it hoter
black :: cause black is the darkest color which will m ake absorb the most heat.
white :: White would be a good color, because on sunny days when the house is being shined on the white will make it cooler rat her then black, dark gray, or light gray. White will be cooler because in the Hot Lamp experiment they tested results for all the 4 colors above. and the average temperatrure for white was 42(DEG) C, light gray was 45(DEG) C, dark gray was 48(DEG) C, and black was 53(DEG)C. That shows that white wa s the coldest color while being shined on by light. Therefore white would be the best color to choose for the doghouse.
light gray ::  light gray because when it is sunny out the d og wont be hot beause black and other dark colors attract the sun.
white ::  white would keep the doghouse colder then any other colors and dogs hate when there hot and really cold so white is pe rfet
black ::  brandi and jerry should paint the dog house b lack if they want the dog to stay warm, because black absorbed the most h eat at an average of 53.25
light gray ::  it would keep the dog house at a good temp. the entire year round.
white :: the white color will decrease the temperature in the doghouse because the average tmeperature for color black was 53 d egrees. and the average tempreature for the color white was 42 degrees. a nd thus the doghouse will be cooler
black :: well black absorbs light soo black absorbs he at which would keep the dog warmer .
light gray :: Light Gray will affect the doghouse by keepin g it a nuetral temperature so it doesnt get too hot in the summer and too cold in the winter. in the investigation light gray was the s3rd hottest so it was one of the middle colors so it would stay nuetral.
white :: Because if you have a dog house and you paint it a white it will be a light grey inside the dog house and so from tha t the dog house will be a nice shade of white with a light coat of grey o n the inside of the doghouse and if the dog house is a square thier will be a perfect color on the d og house.
white :: White. Because the black attracts light so th en the dog house would heat up. th edark Gray is also like the black so t hat wont work either. The last decision was light gray or white so i pick ed white because that color doesnt attract light.
light gray :: Brandi and Jerry should use light gray so it could keep the dog cool in the summer and warm in the winter.
white ::  if the doghouse is painted white the air temp erature will be lower than light gray, dark gray, or black. the white lid jar had an average temperature of 42(DEG)C. the light gray lid had an a verage temperature of 45(DEG)C. the dark gray lid had an average tempera ture of 48(DEG)C. and the black lid had an average temperature of 53(DEG) C. therefor white will help make the inside of the doghouse cooler.
white ::  If the color is a dark color then the tempera ture will increase more than if the color is a lighter shade. White was t he color that affected the temperature the least in the experiment and th at would be the best color for the doghouse's temperature.
white :: because white its absorbs less energy there f or cooler air tempeture
dark gray :: it might affect the dog house a little. I cho ose dark gray because it's average.
white :: it wil be the coolest one at 42(DEG)C and do gs have fur to keep them warm so you want a cool doghouse
light gray :: The light gray is the best brcause it will ab sorb the heat from the sun but won't get to hot.
white :: This color will affect the doghouse because the color white will allow more air to be in the doghouse at once.
white ::  I chose white because from the results of the experiment, white had the lowest average temperature of 42(DEG)C which means that the inside of the doghouse would be cooler for the dog if the sun is shining on it all day.
light gray ::  This color might affect the dog house because in the summer, when it's really hot, the light grey will not get too hot and the house is cooler and not as stuffy for the dog to sleep in versus' the black, it would be immensely humid and stuffy in there. Also, the light grey is good for the dog's wellbeing because during the winter time, the temperature will be really cold, but it would be dark enough to keep warm. So in conclusion, light grey is the best because it keeps cool in the summer and it keeps warm in the winter. Some evidence is that in the experiment, the average for the light grey was 45(DEG) C and the average for the black w as 53(DEG) C. The light gray kept cool while the black did not. So durin g the summer, the dog would die of heat stroke if they had a black house. If they had a light grey house, they would have a nice cool house to lou nge in over the summer and it is a good way to keep warm during the winte r as well! Black is more of a winter color to keep warm during the winter .
black :: it will make the doghouse really warm inside because the darker the color the more it absorbs energy .
white :: white color will give back the sunlight, it m ake the doghouse will not get too much hot.
white ::  The color white is a combination of all of th e known colors and by being that combination absorbs less heat while proj ecting the combination color that it produces.
white ::  The color white would be a good color for a d oghouse because it heats up the air in it the least. In the experiment, t he color white only heated up the air in the jar to an average of 42(DEG) C compared to the color black which heated up the air in the jar to an average of 53(DEG)C.
white :: It would reflect the most sunlight so the ins ide temprature would be cooler than if you were to use any of the other c olors
white ::  This color might affect the dog house because the lighter the color the cooler the dog house will be.
dark gray :: If they choose dark gray as the color for the doghouse, the temperature of doghouse would be neither too hot or too co ld for the dog. I chose dark gray because black would be too hot for dogs because they have furs but white would be too cold because even though t he dogs have furs, if the temperature is cold, thye will get cold. So i t hink dark gray is the best color to choose.
white ::  White would be the best color because it refl ects the light so it would not be to hot and not to cold in the dog house .
dark gray :: It will be warm inside the doghouse, but not too warm. The black lid made the air in the the jar very warm. I t hought it might be too hot for the dog.
white ::  the white was the coldest and most dogs have a lot of fur so therefor the white would be best
dark gray :: it will not be to hot or to cold
dark gray ::  I chose dark gray because black is the darkes t color and from the previous experiment it showed that darker colors abs orb more heat. As for white is would get the least amount of heat. Main r eason I chose dark gray was because from my expericence dogs tend to be c old, so it will be warm but not too hot.
white :: White would be the best color for a dog house because it would not absorb as much energy as the other colors and there fore a white doghouse would not be as hot inside as black or gray one. Th e results from the expirement showed that the air in the jar with a black lid was 11 degrees C hotter than the jar with a white lid, and the same would apply to a doghouse.
light gray :: Well, if you paint the dog house light gray i t will keep the dog warm at night ,But not to warm were its over heated.
black :: becouse black color gets worm fastere then other colors and gets hit black get the tempeture 54 , the other colors get less then that
white :: If they use the white color than the dog hous e would be cooler because brighter colors reflect the sun and in the end it would bw cooler for the dog which would make the dog happier. also the white color would look good
black :: Brandi and Jerry should paint their doghouse black. He will be warm inside the black doghouse because the average tempature of the black lid was 53(DEG)C. In the jar with the white lid, the average tempature was 42(DEG)C. It will be 11(DEG)C warmer in the black doghouse than the white one. That is teh case because black attracts more sunlight and white repels sunlight.
white :: This color will make the inside of the dog ho use cooler according to the data given by Brandi and Jerry's expirement.
dark gray :: Brandi and Jerry should paint their dog house dark gray because dark gray doesn't ge to hot and isn't to cold. In the summer than the dog house will not get to warm yet it will not get to col d in the winter because it does attract some sunlight to keep it at an av erage of 48(DEG)C. That way their dog can always enjoy it's dog house no matter what the temperature is outside.
dark gray ::  the darker the color the warmer it is inside. and if it was black it would be to hot and white or light gray would get to cold.
black :: make the doghouse warmer
white ::  white would be best because it reflects more energy, the table shows that the average temp. after three trials for the white lid was 42 degrees celcius which is 11 dgrees cooler than the h ighest average(52 degrees celcius) or the black lid.
black :: the darker color obsorbs more heat so it woul d bi a good dog house
white ::  It would make the dog house cooler because it wouldnt attract as much heat. This is because the darker the color, the more energy it absorbs.
white :: the white paint is the best because it wont get as hot as the other color's will beacuse the highest temp was 43 (DEG)c and the lowest was 41(DEG)c so white is the best becaue it stays the coldest
black :: It May affect the dog house by making it warm er than the dark grey , light grey and white paint would.because the colo r black attracts heat more than any other color.
light gray :: idk $$$
black :: the solor energy (sun) will be attracted to the black paint, to make the inside temperature of the doghouse increase.
white :: if ypu wanted the dog house to be cooler then i would pick a white lid because the whiit lid was an averige of 11(DEG) c cooler then the black, dark grey or light grey
light gray :: the color of the doghouse might affect the in side of the doghouse by the temperature inside. As shown in the data tab le of the experiment, the data shows that the average temperature is 45(DEG) C which when comapared to other temperatures it shows that it is not lowest or the highest its in the middle.
white :: I think that white would be the best color to paint the dog house because it is the color that reflects the most light so it would keep the dog nice and cool during the summer. This experiment shows that the white lid had the lesser temperature inside of the jar so it is the best color.
dark gray ::  Dark gray would be a good color to paint the doghouse because it's not too hot and it's not too cold. The average temperature would be 48(DEG) C. Just right.
white ::  the dog house will be coller in the sun becau se the thermal heat will not get as hot as if it got painted black .
white ::  The color white might affect the dog house be caus lighter colors reflect light.
light gray :: I would say light gray because if it was blac k and in the summer time it would be way to hot and if it was white in th e winter it could get to cold so I think light gray is the best because i t wouldn't be to hot in the summer or to cold in the winter.
black ::  i pick black because black is a dark color an d and darker colors atract energy (like heat).so that way the inside of t he dog house will be worm.like for the black lid all the results were 54 and all the other colors were 10(DEG) and less.
light gray :: The color will affect it by warming up inside the dog house but not makeing it to hot beacase 48(DEG)c is really hot so why not make it less like 45(DEG)c, and 42(DEG)c and 53(DEG)c is to cold and too hot so make it warm.....wouldn't u want a warm place to stay insted of being cold while you sleep or sweating out of no were?
white :: It would keep the doghouse cooler.
white :: the color white absorbed the least heat out o f all the colors so the doghouse would not get overheated inside and stay cool just in case there was a hot summer day
white :: i would pick white because with white it stay s cooler in the doghouse than if were black to be more hotter inside.
black ::  The color will make the doghouse warmer, decr easing the need for auxiliary equipment facilitating the increased conduc tion of heat energy from the contained atmosphere between the doghouse wa lls to the dog, thus facilitating the dog's survival while maximizing cos t-efficiency. Therefore the doghouse should be black. quod erat demonstratum
dark gray :: This color would keep the temperature just ri ght. It wouldn't be too hot or to too cold. The average (DEG)C was 48(DEG) C, the lowest average wsa 42(DEG)C and the highest average was 53(DEG)C.
white :: Choosing white for the color of the doghouse will keep the inside of the doghouse cooler because darker colors absorb more energy.
white ::  The darker the paint the more heat inside the room so you want the lightest colored object
black :: It will make it so that the dog will be warme r at winter.
light gray :: i pick light gray because after 3 trials of 24(DEG)c for 10 minutes it had an average of 45 which means that the temperature remained not to hot and not to cold.
light gray :: black because it would get to hot for the dog and white because it could also get to cold
light gray :: I think light gray, because from the data tha t was the color that was almost in the middle, so that the dog house woul dn't get too heated in the summmer or spring, and it wouldn't get too col d in the winter or fall.
:: do they want the dog house to be warmer or co oler: if they want to have the dog house warm all year choose black paint . if they want ithe dog house cooler all year then chose white paint. if they want the dog house to be luke-warm chose gray paint. if they wanted it to be medeum-cold chose light gray paint. not enof info to tell what you are asking for
white ::  Black could cause the inside of the doghouse to heat up quickly because the color black heats up faster then most othe r colors.
white :: White will keep the dog house cool on a hot s ummer day more than a darker color such as black. white was on averge 11(DEG) c cooler than black.
black :: Since dark colors capture more heat, use black for color to help keep doghouse warm.
light gray :: The best paint color to paint a dog house bas ed on the results is light gray. I said light gray because it was average 45(DEG)C. it is not too hot and not too cold. If you painted the dog ho use light gray it would keep the dog warm but not too warm. The black lid was average 53(DEG)C. it got hotter because the color was darker. the d ark gray was average 48(DEG)C. it was warm but not as warm as the black because the color was not as dark. the light gray was average 45(DEG)C. it got cooler because the lid color was lighter. The white lid averaged 4 2(DEG)C because it was the lightest, and dark colors absorb more heat.
white :: White might affect the doghouse because it will not absorb as much heat as any of the other colors do. Black absorbed an average of 53 and white was only 42.
black :: The color might affect by since it is black i t will absorb more light energy which then makes the temputure higher so the inside will be warmer/hotter.
white :: The color white will keep the doghouse cool u nder sunlight, because in the expirement, the white color reflects sunlig ht, not absorbing it. so, the doghouse will be cooler
white :: If it is a lighter color then the doghouse wo n't get as hot as it would if you painted it a darker color.
white :: This color might effect the doghouse because white had the lowest temperature from all the colors. In average 42(DEG) C. Also it will keep the doghouse cool in the summer so the dog doesnt get too warm in the summer.
light gray ::  They should use light gray paint because the black would attract too much heat. The darker paint would absorb more heat like the black lid. The white paint would be too light, and in the winter wouldn't attract as much heat as needed.
light gray ::  The color light grey will not absorb too much heat in the Summer to keep the dog cool, but will retain some heat in the winter to keep the dog warm. In the experiment, the color light grey had a temperature that was 21(DEG) higher than the starting temperature of 24(DEG), but did not increase too much like the dark grey and black which rose 24(DEG) and 30(DEG) from the original temperature of 24(DEG).
white :: White would be the best color because it had the lowest air temperature with 42(DEG)C. This would keep the inside of the doghouse air temperature cooler on hot days than a darker color would .
light gray ::  For the bog house not to be to cold or hot.
black ::  Black was the highest tempature when under th e lamp so if Brandi and Jerry wanted a warm doghouse they would choose bl ack because black had an avrage of 53(DEG)c insted of other averages lik e 48(DEG)c 45(DEG)c and 42(DEG)c
white ::  i think that if you use a white paint then th e dog house will be nice a cool because if you use black the dog would ge t hot so that why you shuld use white.
dark gray :: During the summer the dog houses temp. would be 48(DEG). This would keep it cool. During the winter the darker color will help keep the heat inside the dog house.
black :: black attracts more heat
black :: The black paint will trap more heat inside. I t will be hotter in the doghouse than if Brandi and Jerry used dark grey, light grey, or white.
dark gray :: the dark Gray Color Is fine becuz iTs Not to dark and its not too brigth. Dark Gary had A 48(DEG)c avg And The Darkes t is black which HAd a 53(DEG)c avg also the brightest which is wh ite had a 42(DEG)c avg
black :: it would make the doghouse warm due to the da rk color.
black :: the black paint color will attract more sun for the dog to keep warm and be comfortable
white :: White is the best color to paint the doghouse because, based on the experiment, dark colors absord heat and light colo rs don't. The hottest air temperature in the jar experiment (53(DEG)c) w as from the jar with the black lid, and the jar with the coolest air temp erature (42(DEG)c) was from the jar with the white lid, proving that lig ht colors don't absorb heat and dark colors do.
white ::  Painting the doghouse white would ensure that the dog doesn't get too hot while it's inside. White would keep the inside of the doghouse cooler than any other color. I know this because in the experiment, the average temperature for the white-lidded jar was less than any other colored lid.
white ::  The color might affect the doghouse by taking in less energy causing the inside of the doghouse to be cooler.
white ::  By painting the dog house white, it would make the inside of the doghouse cooler. This is proven because in each trial, white had the lowest temperature. For example, in the experiment, White's average tempurate was 42(DEG), compared to black's average, which was 53(DEG); a huge difference!
white :: i chose white because white reflects the suns energy so it would stay cooler in the doghouse. the data that Brandi and Jerry got show that white kept the temperature about 11(DEG)C cooler th an the black lid
black :: it will make it warmer for the dog inside bec ouse it absorbs more energy.
light gray ::  I think that light gray will look nice on the outside of the dog house and it will keep the dog very nice and cool because on the data it shows that light gray was the second coolest colored lid.
white :: The color white will affect the inside of the doghouse because in the Lid vs. Air Temperature Inside Glass Jar table, it shows that the color white doesn't heat up as much as the other colors . The color white reflects the light making it stay cool, which is what y ou want for a doghouse.
black :: i think the color black will make the isnside of the dog house warm because it is a dark color.
white :: They might use white because it doesnt get ho t as fast as the other colors do. In the data table it shows that the fir st trail was 42(DEG) C the second trial was 43(DEG) C the third was 41(DEG) C and the fourth was 42(DEG) C. For all the other colors the trials got highe r than 43(DEG) C therefore , the white would be best for a dog house bec ause it doesnt get as hot.
light gray :: it will make the dong house in between hot an d cold
white :: white attracts less heat so the dog will no b e harmed on very hot days.
white :: to design the dogs house i think that the pai nters should you used white paint, because sunlight absorbs into darker c olors because they cannot reflect the light so therefor the dark colors j ust continue to absorb all the light.
black ::  It will make the inside of the dog house cold or warm .
white :: The color white would be the best to paint th e doghouse because it will be kept cooler than Black, which the average w as 53 degree celcius, dark gray which the average was 48 degree celcius, ligh gray which the average was 45 degrees celcius, and the whites averag e was 42 degree celius. Black absorbs the most heat, while white reflects .
white :: This color would make the dog house 11(DEG)C cooler than than if it was a black color. So the dog wouldnt be hot all the time and have a cool temperature in the house. In Brandy and Jerry's experiment the white lid was the coldest, and they said dark colors absor b more heat, so white would be an appropriate color.
light gray ::  Light gray might affect the doghouse by havin g the averge temperature of 45(DEG)c, so if it is cold outside it wont fre eze the dog or if it's too hot outside it wont make the dog too hot. Black had the highest aveage of 53(DEG)c, dark gray had the aveage of 48 (DEG)c,and white had the lowest average of 42(DEG)c. The light gray is just the right temperature for the doghouse of 45(DEG)c.
light gray :: This color might bring the inside of the dogh ouse to a comfortable temperature. According to the results of the experi ment, the colors were in this order (from the highest to lowest temperatu re): black, dark gray, light gray, white. Dogs do not normally enjoy hot, stuffy enviornments. They pant uncontrollably when they are overheated, and get very uncomfortable. This light gray color will allow the dog not to get uncomfortably overheated, but will also not allow him/her to reach an uncomfortably cool body temperature- as white was resulted in the col dest temperature according to the experiment results.
white :: i think that white is a good color because he at will not be attracted as fast and white is a really nice color.
black ::  This color would keep the doghouse warm during the nights and cold days, and if it is a hot day then the dog will be outside anyways
black :: Black will keep the inside of the doghouse the warmest because it will absorb the most heat. In the lab, black had an average of 53(DEG)C and white had an average of 42(DEG)C.
black :: black is a darker color so there forth it att racts heat which would cause th tempatuer to go up
dark gray ::  Well, the dark gray would make it warmer, but not to warm. &amp;they temperature would stay at one degree. So, its would be 48(DEG) in there.
white :: it would reflect most heat because it absorb as much emergy as darker colors
black :: Black because the black had the highest numbe r the whole expirment and it stayed the warmest out of all of the other c olor
white :: Coloring the doghouse white will give an effe ct by not making it hot like other colors. In the experiment, they found out that the white lid had the lowest temperature of 42(DEG). The black lid was 53(DEG), the dark gray was 48(DEG), and lastly, the light gray was 45(DEG). Therefore, we can conclude that the white attracts the leas t sunlight which will affect the temperature of the inside less.
light gray :: light gray because when the dog is sleeping i n the dog house and its ranning he will get cold because it is white so t hey for light gray will keep it warm and cool at the same time for those winter days and the cold days with ran
black ::  the sun will be attracted to black and it wil l make the dog house really hot
white :: darker colors absorb heat from light, so ligh ter colors reflect it.
light gray ::  it will wear.
white :: white because it kept the inside of the jar t he coolest so the dog wouldn't get to hot in the summer. the insidde of t he b jar with the black lid had an average of 53(DEG) c and the jar with the white lid only had an average of 42(DEG)c
black :: the color might effect the inside because the color of the wood.
white :: The color white will ensure that the temperature inside the dog house will stay much cooler than the colors black, dark gray and light gray, because lighter colors don't absorb as much heat energy as darker colors do. For example the inside of the jar with the black colored lid had an average temperature of 53(DEG)c while the inside tempeture of a jar with a white lid had an average temperature of only 42(DEG) c. The inside of the jar with the white lid was 11(DEG)c less than the jar did with the black lid.
dark gray :: it will be warm in the doghouse for the winte r, but not to hot for the dog in the summer.
black :: because it atracks energy and that makes the paint to come off .
light gray :: it wouldnt be to hot to live in(for a dog)but it would be warm and provide heat.
white :: White, because white paint adsorbse heat less than the darker colors, and you wouldn't want your dog to over heat.
light gray :: light gray will keep the dog house warm in th e winter because it is a dark color and it will also cool down the dog ho use because it is a light color aswel.
white :: it would keep the dog cool enough to withstan d the heat and have enough warmth for winter since dogs have fur on their bodies to keep warm.
black :: Having a black doghouse might affect the insi de of a doghouse because it would keep it warmer inside because darker co lors such as black absorb heat better. In Brandi and Jerry's experiment t he average temperature for the black lid jar was 53(DEG)C, 5(DEG)C more than the next warmest one, dark gray.
black :: If they paint the dog house black the conditi ons in the house would be hot because the jar was the hottest when they p ut the black lid on the jar. So that shows that black absorbs more energy than any other color.
dark gray :: the darker the color of the doghouse the hott er it will be, so in the summer you dont want it to be black and in the w inter you dont want it to be white. so i picked dark gray becasue in the winter it will still attrack sunlight to keep it warm but in the summer i t wont attract as much as the black would
:: its depends on were they live if its a hot pl ace then a white dog house but if its a cold place then a black dog house to make the doghouse a little warmer and in the middle if its a mixture.
white :: White would make the dog house cooler and mor e pleastent to live in.
dark gray :: I would choose dark gray because in the summe r it may become warm for the dog, so black would be too hot. In the winte r black would be the best because it is a color that attracts more energy so it would increase the temperature inside. So for an all around the ye ar comfortable paint I would choose dark gray because its the median betw een them both.
white :: Ir Afeeect other people to what they may have dont to othewers and atht jksdjoiauy dhsaj 3 hfgyunashgygajshu\
light gray ::  Dark grey would affect the temperature in the dog house by making it so that the dog house was neither too hot or too cold. The results of the experiment show that the air inside of the jar with the white lid had a average tempeture of about 42(DEG)C. In the winter if the dog house was painted white it would get to cold because the experiment shows that white does not retain heat well. Black was the color that retained the most heat in the experiment with an average tempeture of 53(DEG)C. However, even though according to the experiment,the dog house would be warm in the winter if the doghouse was painted black it would be too hot in the summer for the dog to remain cool. The experiment shows that the air inside of the jar with the light grey lid was warmer than the jar with the white lid, but only by 3(DEG)C, therefore the dog house should be painted dark grey because in the experiment the jar with the dark grey lid is 5(DEG)C cooler than the jar with the black lid. The dark grey would allow the doghouse to remain cool in the summer, but remain warm in the winter.
light gray :: it will let the energy go in and out...
black ::  because that way the dog wont be hot or cold, it would not be cold but it wont be hot eighter.
black :: Black will absorb more heat, therefore keepin g the dog warm throughout the year. the average temperature inside the ja r with a black lid was 53 degrees Celcius, while all the other colors had an average of 48 degrees celsius or lower.
dark gray ::  dark gray would heat up the air for a dog to a comfortanble temerature and not make it to hot like the black lid or make it to cold like the light lid
black :: Because the darker the color the sunlight it attracks because, of the solar energy.
black ::  The color black will keep the doghouse warm in the winter. The color black absorbs heat better than the other colors. The experiment results show that black is better because in trial 1temperature was 54(DEG)c and the coldest for black was 52(DEG)c. The least warmest was the color white. The highest temperature was 43(DEG)c. the lowest was 41(DEG)c. I chose black because it will keep the dog the warmest in the cold winter. White would not be as warm as black is.
dark gray :: By painting he dog house the color dark grey might affect the dog house by making it warmer on cold nights but not to hot like the black color will make it. I think this because on the result s chart the black is a higher temp. than the dark grey and the dark grey also always stays a consistent temp. In conclusion I think they sho uld paint the dog house grey because inside it it will niether be to hot nor to cold.
white :: The white paint would make the inside of the doghouse coolest because according to the experiment the average of each color are black:53, dark gray:48, light gray:45, and white:42.
white ::  White would make a good color for a doghouse because its a rather remains at a rather cool tempertaure not too hot for the poor dogs, as seen on Lid Color vs. Air Temperature for each lid col or table where it shows the average of the white lid's temperture was 42( (DEG) C)
white :: The Darker Colors Absorb more energy So if You Picked Black Then The Temperture would increase in the Air , for example in the experiment the Tempeture went to 54(DEG) . And for the white lid it only went up to 41(DEG) thats why painting the dog house white is better choice because it wont get so hot in the dog house.
white ::  it will let it be less hotter.
white ::  A white colored doghouse will make the air te mperature warmer in warm temperature, but the light color will not mak e the temperature go up a lot. With the black lid color, the temperature of the air i nside the jar was adn average of 53(DEG) after ten minutes. The white ja r was and average of 42(DEG) after ten minutes. Since both jars started at 24(DEG), the temperature of the black jar increased 29(DEG) while th e temperature of the white only increased 18(DEG). The darker the color of something, the more heat the object absorbs. That means that teh white doghouse will be the coolest doghouse, even though that doghouse will wa rm up as well.
dark gray ::  I would say dark gray because when the sun co mes out you don't want your dog to be to warm but not to cold so dark gra y would work perfectly in my opinion.
white :: The doghouse would have a cooler temperature than one painted in gray or black because the average temperature inside a white doghouse was 42(DEG) while the average temperatures of the black , dark gray, and light gray doghouses were 53(DEG), 48(DEG), and 45(DEG) respectively.
black ::  IT WILLBE HOTTER COSE ITS HOT
white :: white had the lowest temperature so the dogho use wont get extremely hot.
light gray ::  it might be less hot than a darker lid becaus e black absorbes the most heat.
white :: Brandi and Jerry should paint their doghouse white. This is because in the summer, when the temperature outside gets h otter, the inside of the doghouse will be cooler for the dog. That is bec ause darker colors absorb more light ad heat energy.
dark gray ::  The dark gray color might affect the doghouse by keeping the doghouse the same temperature throughout the year which i s not too cool but not too hot (48(DEG)). I know this because on the dat a table it shows that throughout all the trials the dark gray was the col or that kept the temperature inside the jar stay the same.
white :: The white paint would be the best choice for a color of a dog house because after 10 minutes of having a white lid, th e air temperature inside the jar was the lowest. It seemed that the light er the color, the lower average temperature the air inside the jar was af ter 10 minutes. This would be the best color for a dog house because if y ou would like to keep your dog cooler in the summertime, having a white p ainted dog house would stay much cooler on the inside that if there was a black paint instead.
white ::  Painting the doghouse white will raise the temperature only slightly, while painting the doghouse a darker color wil l raise the temperature significantly. In the Lid Color vs. Air Temperature Inside Glass Jar data table, the temperature inside the jar with the white lid, raised an average of 18(DEG) C from the starting tem perature after 10 minutes. The temperature inside the jar with the black colored lid raised an average of 29(DEG) C from the starting temperature after 10 minutes. If Brandi and Jerry wanted the temperature in the doghouse to be cool, then they would paint the doghouse white. If they wa nted the temperature to be warm, they would paint the doghouse black. I w ould paint the doghouse white.
black :: more dogs like black
"white ::  If they were to use white the dog house would be cooler for the dog to sleep in or just hang out and cause less "" damages"" or issues to the dog"
light gray ::  the light gray so its not to hot and not to c old
light gray ::  I would choose Dark gray because on a hot day, the dog can stay nice and cool, and on a cold day the color is still a ble to absorb some heat. The experiment proved that darker colors absorb more heat than lighter so the dark gray color would be the best. Also in the trials, The average temp of the jar is 48(DEG)c so the dog would be nice and warm in the house.
white :: The color white might affect the doghouse by being cooler inside than the darker colors because white obsordes less he at than dark colors. Thats why in Brandi and Jerry's lid experiment white lid was the coolest of the darker colors.
white :: I choose white because white is the lightest color and it absorb the least heat so inside the dog house will be more c ooler. I know this because in the investigation it said white had 42(DEG) C which is the lowest while the black had 54(DEG)C which is the highest.
white :: the lighter color would help keep the doghous e cooler inside. for example, the jar with the white colored lid was cool er; 42(DEG) than the black lid; 53(DEG)
light gray :: Because it made a mild temperature in the jar
white :: How this color might affect the doghouse is w hen a color is lighter like the color white, that color doesn't absorb al ot of heat like the color black. So when it's going to be really hot outs ide, inside the doghouse it will be cool.
light gray :: this would absorb more thermal energy while still keeping cool because of the lightns of the gray.
black :: black will affect the doghouse because it wil make the inside hot.
light gray :: The light gray would keep the dog house at a more even temp because its both a light and dark color so it would atrackt the right amount of sun light and repel just the right amou nt of sun light.
white :: the doghouse should be white because it has the warmest or cooldest temperture on the average from the table. it will be warmer or colder than the other colors so the dog living in the doghouse wont be hot or cold.
dark gray :: The color will affect the dighouse by not mak ing it to cold and not making it to warm.
white ::  i would make the dog house white because whit e dose not actracte alot of heat so the dog would not be so hot.&#916;
light gray ::  LIght grey would be a great color to use on a dog house because, the color would not obsorb a lot of heat and and it w ould not be to cold because grey is still a dark color that could obsorb heat, when needed.
white ::  White paint would definatly be the coolest tempreature for the dog becasue after the 10 mins. under the light it was the coldest with an average of 42o, 11 degrees colder than the hottest pai nt color of black the average of the black paint's air was 53.
white ::  the inside wont be as hott.
dark gray ::  The best paint color for a doghouse would be dark gray because the temperature inside of the doghouse wouldn't be too hot for the dog, but it wouldn't be too cold. It was 48(DEG)C in the jar with a dark gray lid on average. That is more suitable for a doghouse th an the black lid, which was 53(DEG)C, or the white lid, which was 42(DEG) C.
dark gray :: dark grey because if you use this color the d og house will be about 48 degrees and the dog house will not be to cold
dark gray :: The color, dark gray, would affect the doghou se because it would stay at a pretty warm temperature. This way, the dogh ouse would be around 48(DEG). The doghouse would not be too hot (53(DEG) ), as it would be with the color black, but the doghouse would not be too cold (42(DEG)), as it would be with the color white.
light gray :: Because the dogs liked their home and the dog feels comfortable.
light gray ::  Light gray wouldnt be to hot or to cold so the tem[erature would be just right.
black ::  if you use black paint then it will take in m ore heat because dark colors absorb more energy like they found out in th e lab hot lamp the black was at least 5(DEG)c hotter then all the other colors.
white :: because it obsorb less heat and energy
white ::  It wil make it so the air inside of the dogho use will be cooler so the dog dosnt get to hot. I knowjthis because the d ata shows the averge temperature for white was 42(DEG)c.
white ::  Less heat in the dog house so there would be much more comfort for the dog.
black :: this color would make the doghouse warmer bec ause in the experiment the darker the color, the warmer it will be inside .
white :: White is best in this situation, as long as i ts not cold out. white reflects heat, thus the Husky or Lab or what ever dog or wolf it is, stays cool and collect.
light gray :: The color absorbs enough heat not to be cold in the winter, but not to much heat to be hot in the summer.
dark gray :: It will take in heat in the winter and won't take as much in in the summer as black would.
white :: white absorbs less heat so it would keep the dog cooler
light gray ::  Light gray is the best color for the dog hous e because it doesn't make the dog house too hot but it also doesn't make the dog house too cold. The black had an average temperature of 53(DEG)C which is too hot for a dog in the summer. it needs to be at a rela xing temperature which is 45(DEG)C for the light gray. If i were to choo se the white it would be too cold for the poor dog to be in. The light gr ay color would make it so that the dog could be very confortable in his l ittle house.
black ::  The black paint because it will absorb more light energy causing the inside of the dog house to be warmer, keeping the dog warm at night. The average temperature for the black lid was 53(DEG), while the white was 42(DEG). The black paint had the highest temperature out of all colors and was 11(DEG) higher than the white paint.
white :: The black color, when it gets dark dogs will have a dark doghouse so i just picked white.
black ::  Clack absorbs more heat energy, so it would m ake the doghouse a warmer place for the dog. The average temperature for the black lid was on average about 8(DEG) C more than the other colored lids. That is why black would be a good choice to paint the doghouse with .
white :: porque es el que da mas inside de glass
black :: If the color of the doghouse was black then i t would make the inside of the doghouse warmer inside. In the experiment it was 53(DEG)C on average in the jar when the lid was black and only 42 (DEG)C on average when the lid of the jar was white.
black :: i think they should use blak beacause it woul d be warmer for the dog.
white :: The darker colors will absorb heat faster tha n lighter colors.
black :: Black, because on a warm day the dog house would heat up but it wouldnt be too hot for the dog. And on a cold day the dog house should be the same tempature ( 53(DEG) C ) or get a little col der, but not to cold for the animal.
dark gray :: I chose the dark gray paint color because it would keep the dog warmer in the winter than the white or light gray pain t, but cooler in the summer than the black paint would. The experiment su pports this because the dark grey paint in the experiment made the inside temperature an average of 48(DEG)C, while the highest average data, the black paint, was a temperature of 53(DEG)C, too hot, and the lowest av erage data, the white paint, was 42(DEG)C, too cold for the dog.
white ::  white would not attract as much heat as the o ther darker colors
light gray ::  Light gray would be the best paint color for a doghouse. Light gray had an average temp of 45 degrees which wouldn't b e too cold or too warm for a dog. A white doghouse was 42 degrees which m ight make the dog cold and black and dark gray would make the dog too war m. Dark grays average was 48 and blacks average was 53, much too warm.The refore light gray would be the best color.
white ::  If the insid eof the dog house is white then the dog house wont be so hot because of the shade
black :: If you see the doghouse black then you can se e better because the color is black you can see black better in the after noon.
white :: I would pick white paint to paint the dog hou se because according to the experiment white was the color that the insid e of the jar would be less hot. Accordig to Brandi and Jerry's data the w hite lid had a temperature 42(DEG)C inside the jar and the black lid was 53(DEG)C and i dont want my dog to be to hot or sufficate in the dog ho use.
light gray :: I would chose light gray because in the summe r, a black house might over-heat the dog, however in the winter a white h ouse might be too cool. A light gray house would repel heat in the summer , and allow more heat in the winter.
dark gray :: If Brandi and Jerry colored the doghouse white, it would not asorb the heatness like the color black. Therefore, it would feel more comfortable for the dog when it is hot outside. The reason why black was to asorb heat, because in the data table it had higher degree then white, which had a lowest degree in temperature.
light gray :: the color would keep the doghouse at a perfec t temperature not to hot or not to cold
black :: Black would be a good color for the dog house because in the day it would get hotter because black absorbs heat causin g it to be warmer in their at night.
black :: We can see from this expirement that darker colors absorb more heat. Knowing this information, for the dog to be more warm and comfortable inside his doghouse, Brandi and Jerry should paint the house Black.
white :: Assuming that the location of the doghouse ha s a warm climate, the white paint color will be more likely to keep the t emperature of the air inside the doghouse at a cooler, or lower, temperat ure. This can be said because the white paint color, on average, made the air inside the glass jar a temperature of 42(DEG) C, compared to 53(DEG) C for black paint, 48(DEG) C for dark gray paint, and 45(DEG) C for light gr ay paint. It is vital that the doghouse maintains a low temperature so th at the dog, that stays inside the doghouse, doesn't overheat.
white ::  They should use white paint because when the sun comes out the doghouse won't get as much heat absorbed. As shown in t he table the darker lid they used the hotter the air became and white is the lightest color used and it had the lowest temperature.
dark gray ::  The color will effect the dog house by keepin g it the same temperature which would be cool in the summer and warm in t he winter because the trials show that the dark grey paint made the jar t he same temperature for all 3 trials; which the average temperature was 48(DEG)C.
dark gray :: I think the best color for the dog house is D rrk gray, because it's not the hotest color or the coldest which will hel p the dog stay cool but also warm. It showed that in each trial the tempe rture was 48(DEG)C for the dark gray color which mean that the tem perture will stay medium for most the time. Also Dark gray takes in more heat then white by 6(DEG)C average.
white :: it will keep it cooler due to the fact that w hite dosnt abosorb as much heat as dark gray, light gray and black. also, because blacks average (in (DEG)c) was 53 dark grays average was 48. li ght grays average was 45 and whihtes avergae is 42. leaving that white wi ll leave the dog house cooler.
black :: black would be the best because it keeps the inside of the dog house the warmest and would keep the dog warm and not cold
black ::  Black would be an ideal color to pain the dog house because of the insulation if provides within. Out of all the colors of white, dark gray, light gray, black and white, black had the highest temperature within the glass jar with and average of 53(DEG)C while the lowest temperature was with the color of white with an average of 42(DEG) C. Thus choosing black should make the doghouse warmer because black seemed to have a high temperature than any other. However, you must also consider w here the doghouse is being placed. If the doghouse should be placed outdo ors, black would be the ideal color to keep the dog warm during cold wint ers. If placed indoors, the color may not matter because indoors is usually warm.
white :: White would be the best color because it will be more cooler in the dog house then any of the colors above. In t he data table with black paint, the average was 53 ((DEG)C). The w hite paint, the average was 42 ((DEG)C). So that shows that if you go fo r light colors it will reduce the heat inside but if you do want it reall y hot then go for the dark colors.
black :: 1:The dog will be feeling like fanetting. 2:The dog will gett thirsty. 3:The dog will breath reeally hard.
white ::  The color should keep the inside of the dog house at a reasonable temperature. Based on the results from the experiment, the hypothesis was right about black soaking up heat through the black rather than white. So the white paint would work the same by keeping the heat under control and not letting it all in.
dark gray :: because dark gray color absorb more energy.
white :: This color effects the dog house because it m akes it cooler according to the Hot lamp experiment.In there experiment t he white lid was the coolest.
white :: The best color to paint the top of the doghou se would be white. In the experiment, on average the black lid absorbed 5 3(DEG)C, dark gray:48(DEG)C, light gray:45(DEG)C, white:42(DEG)C . The black lid absorbed 11(DEG) more heat than the white lid. By painti ng the top of the doghouse white, it decreases the amount of heat getting traped within the doghouse.
white ::  how white would affect the doghouse is that i t would get drityer more easly thats how it would affect the doghouse.
light gray ::  In there experiment they found out that the darker the color the more heat it absorbs so they should use a light grey for the dog house because it doesnt absorb a lot of heat and it will stay nice and cool inside but it will let absorb some heat but it will be just the right tempature.
dark gray :: black because it will get to hot
light gray :: light gray because it wont make the inside of the dog house to hot because the dog already has a large coat of fur and dark gray wont over heat the dog house.
white :: the lighter the color, the less heat will be inside the dog house. the darker the color, more heat will be inside the dog house
white ::  so that the dog can be fresh not hot over the summer and its not too cold for the winter.
dark gray ::  I chose dark gray because, where I live, it can get fairly cold. The dark gray might offer the dog warmth during the winter and at night, without over heating the doghouse. And hopefully in the summer the dog will be able to run around and wont have to worry about getting to hot in the doghouse then. I think your question is too vague. It really depends on the climate and dog breed.
white :: I would choose white because i would want my dog to not have all that heat trapped up in a little tiny space. That hot air which is absorbed through dark colors i wouldn't want my dog sitting in that. I would want him to be cool so thats why i choose the white col or as a paint for a doghouse.
white :: Based on the data, white had the lowest tempe rature average of 42, while others have an average of 45, 48, and 53. It all depends on the dog you are getting, if its fur is dark, better to ge t light colors so it can be cooler.
black :: this color would keep the inside of the dogs house warm because dark colors attract heat from the son.
white :: The color white does not absorb as much heat as a darker color and the doghouse wont get as hot.
light gray :: it can keep it cool in the summer and warm in the winter
white ::  White has less heat absorbtion. If the sun is out and it is hot, the dog house will still be cool inside.White has a t emperature in the low 40's for sitting under a lamp for 10 minutes. light gray has temperatures in the mid 40's. Dark gray is high 40's. ANd black is low to mid 50's.
black :: they sould use black because black keeps heat better than the other colors so the dont want there dog to get cold so b lack is the most affective color.
dark gray :: The temperature will stay the same in the col d and hot weather. The temperature will never be too hot or too cold.
white ::  White would affect the doghouse because accor ding to the results of the experiment, Trial 1 says that using black made the temperature inside 54(DEG), dark gray made it 48(DEG), light gray made it 44(DEG), and white made it 42(DEG). They should choose white be cause it would keep the doghouse the coolest, that way the dog doesn't ov erheat.
white :: The white lid had the lowest temperature and the black lid had the highest temperature so they would use white so when the temperature outside is hot the inside of the dog house wont get hot because the white paint will deflect the heat.
white :: White, because the data showed the tempatures of each of the lids, and from the data table it shows that black (53degr ees) was the highest, and white(42degrees) was the lowest. So if they wan t a to paint the dog house, they should paint it white, do to , the tempa ture of the dog house wont be to hot for the dog to be in.
white :: This color could keep the doghouse cool in di rect sunlight. This could make it more comfertable for the animal.
white :: I choose white because if the doghouse is out side, then the white would absorb enough energy to keep the dog warm with out overheating it.
black :: the air temperature inside will be warm and cozy. black is the warmest in the investigation for the lamp and colo r of the lid it got an average of 53(DEG) C. the lightest color (white) got an average of 42(DEG) C.
dark gray :: A dark gray color would absorb more heat then light gray and white making it warmer but not as much as black so it won t get too warm.
black :: Black would keep the doghouse warmer during cold winters because it holds more heat than the White or the Grays. The average for the Black was 53(DEG)c, and the white was 42(DEG)c. That means the black holds about 11 degrees more of heat.
white :: With white the temperaturein the dog house wo uld stay nice andd cool in the summer
white :: the color white would affect the doghouse by keeping it cooler than any other of the colors. i know this because in th e experiment, the white colored lid had a change of temperature of only 1 8 degrees when the black lid had a change of temperature of 29.
white :: The doghouse will usually be cool inside even on sunny days because the light from the sun will reflect off of the dog house causing the light to not enter it and make the transformation into thermal ( heat ) energy.
white :: If the dog house was white the inside would b e cooler because in the data of the experiment the average temperature of white is 42(DEG)c and blacks average is 53(DEG)c
white ::  that color will keep it cooler and not as hot in the summer time. i know this because in the experiment the black lid had an average of 53 and white had an average of 42, so thats more than a 10(DEG)c difference.
light gray :: Light Gray because its not hot or cold but a little warmer than white.
black :: it will keep the dog house warmer because the black attracks heat
black ::  The color black because it would be warm in t he doghouse. Since black absorbs more heat black would be best to keep th e dog warm rather than cold.
white ::  i think the dog house should be white, becaus e in the experiment, white didnt get very hot. the highest temperature wa s 43(DEG)C and the lowest was 41(DEG)C.
dark gray :: If Brandi and Jerry used the color dark gray for their doghouse that would be the best color because it would keep the doghouse warm and cool depending on the seasons. The color dark gray in the jar experiment had an average of 48(DEG)C. That makes the temp erature of the doghouse in general, not to hot and not to cool based on t he jar experiment.
white :: white will make the doghouse cooler than a da rker color such as black because in the data table it shows that the aver age temperature inside the jar with a white lid was 42(DEG)C and inside the black lid it was 53(DEG)C, that is 11(DEG)C warmer.
black :: If he choses black the doghouse will get more hot air because in the story the black color gets more heat because its darker
white :: It would make it cooler in there for the dog, because white and light colors assimilate less energy and heat then dark er colors. For example, the average for the black lid was 53(DEG)C, but the average for the white lid was only 42(DEG)C. Which is a lot less. So I think Brandi and Jerry should go with painting their doghouse white.
white :: A white dog house will absorb heat the worst so it will be cooler inside. I know this because in the experiment the bl ack lid got to be the hottest at 54(DEG)C well white was the coolest at 42(DEG)C. White was also cooler then dark gray at 48(DEG)C and light gr ay at 44(DEG)C. So white would be the coolest for the doghouse.
black ::  The dog house if painted black will be warmer because the color black atracts heat.
light gray :: The light grey will effect the doghouse by ma king it more noticable and plus dogs can only see black, white and grey.
light gray :: it can make it hot but not to hot cause it do nst atract as much heat as black or dark gray
black ::  the darker the color the more heat it absorbs . Haveing a black dog house would make it warm on the inside
white :: Brandi and Jerry predicted that the darker th e lid color, the greater the increase in air temperature in the glass jar , becuase darker colors absorb more energy. Their hypothesis was correct. This is because the average temperature inside the glass jar with the bl ack lid after three ten-minute trials was 53 degrees but the average temp erature inside the glass jar with the white lid after three ten-minute tr ials was 42 degrees. Because black was the darkest color of the lid, it a bosrbed the most heat so the air temperature was highest (and vice versa for the white lid.) Thus, because we don't want the doghouse to be overhe ated, the best color to paint it would be white because white would absor b the least heat.
black :: The color black will affect the doghouse by m aking it a warmer environment for the dog. Plus if it is a cold winter, t he doghouse will help to keep the dog warmer. The data table shows that u sing the black lid color the air temperature was clearly around 12(DEG) higher then the white lid, about 10(DEG) higher in temperature than the light gray lid, and about 6(DEG) higher in temperature than the dark gray lid each trial. The average temperature was 53(DEG)C for the black lid, the average temperature for the dark gray lid was 48(DEG)C, the average tem perature for the light gray lid was 45(DEG)C, and the average temperatur e for the white lid was 42(DEG)C. It shows the black lid absorbs more he at to keep the doghouse warmer.
black :: is to dark
white ::  White would be the best color for a dog house because according to this expiriment whit absorbs the most heat with an average temperature of 42(DEG)C compared to the black paint which had an average tempurature of 53.25(DEG)C, making the dog house a cooler place to live.
black :: if the doghouse is black than the inside will be warmer when there is sun shining on it, so the dog will stay warm
light gray ::  Light gray would allow the dog house to absorb heat, though not as much as black, so it would not be incredibly h ot, but it would still be warmer than white. Also, it wouldnt be as cold as the white, but would be cooler than the black. So light grey is the perfect color to be not quite hot and not quit e cold, and just the right temperature to make the dog house comfortable for the dog.
white :: the color white reflects most of the sun's he at, while the color black absorbs most of the sun's heat.
white ::  The best paint color for the doghouse would be white. Inside of the doghouse, the air will be cooler for the dog than if it were painted black or gray. The average temperature for the black lid was 53(DEG) C, but for the white lid, it was 42(DEG)C. The white lid made the air 11(DEG) cooler than the black lid.
white :: white cause black makes heat worse and so i c hose white because every dog house is white because its easier to see in the dark and its comfy and warm.
black ::  the darker the color the greater the increase in the air temperature in the dog house because darker colors absorb mor e energy.
white :: white will ceep the doghouse cooler
black :: black will affect the dog house buy keeping h eat in
black ::  brings heat in the dog house
white :: White doesn't attract heat but black, dark gray and light gray do, so the dog would be kept cool.
dark gray ::  Dark gray would keep the temperature of the doghouse constant and it wouldnt be too hot or to cold.
dark gray ::  dark gray will keep the dog house the same te mp in the summer and winter as long as therer is light.
white ::  white is the best becouse it is the coolest and would not over heat he dog
"light gray ::  If you paint the dog house black then the in side will always very hot. Then when the sun is shining on it just like in the lab it says the ""the darker the color"".the gr eater the increase in air inside the doghouse. so i would not choose blac k to be the color for the dog house. i would pick light grey because it i s dark but at the same time it is a light color . when the sun is shining or giving heat to the dog house it will be warm but cool at the same tim e because it is a light color and a light color does not obsorve as much heat."
light gray :: If the doghouse is light gray then in the win ter it will be slightly warmer than the actual temperature and in the sum mer it will be slightly cooler than the actual temperature.
light gray :: based off the results, you would want this co lor because it doesn't attract to much heat , and it wouldn't be to cold at the same time.
light gray :: I think light gray would be the best because it wouldn't be too hot or cold
white :: the white dog house will not make the dog as hot inside because white is a very bright color, but black is a dark colo r so it will get hotter. In the xperiment when the black cap was on the t emperture was hotter than having the white cap on.
light gray :: I choose light gray because light gray isnt t oo light and is not too dark. Light gray will cause the dog house to be a t a comfortable temperature. If it was white, it would be too cold and if it was black, then it would be too hot. In the experiment, light gray ha d an average temperature of 45(DEG)C while white had 42(DEG)C and black had 53(DEG)C.
white :: Brandi and Jerry should use white paint for t here dog house because in the investagation the white paint color only ha d a 18(DEG) increase as black paint had a 29(DEG) increase. the diffren ce between the two paint's tempurture was 11(DEG).
white ::  White would be the best color for a dog house because it absorbs the least amount of heat. In Summer, you wouldn't wan t the dog house to be over-heated. The white color had an average of 42(DEG) C while the black color was 53(DEG)C, this is a difference of 11(DEG)C between the two colors.
black ::  The color black would make the house warmer o n the inside.
white :: I think that white would be a good color, bec ause in Brandi and Jerry's expeirement, white gave a cooler temperature t han the others, so the doghouse could be colder than warmer.
dark gray :: this color would allow the house to collect s ome heat without it being to hot. Since gray is lighter then black but no t to light.
light gray ::  This color would affect the doghouse by being dark enough to let heat in during cold seasons and being light enou gh to keep heat out during the summer and on other hot days. On average, the heat inside the jar with a light gray (45(DEG)C) was cooler than tha t of Black (53(DEG)C) and dark gray (48(DEG)C)
white :: so if it is hot out side and the dog wants to go in side the dog house then it will be cooler because the color of the dog house is white.
light gray ::  It depends on the dog. If the dog has medium amount of hair then the best color would probably be light gray because i t doesnt obsorb that much heat energy. But if the dog was a hairless one then it would be best to go with black so that way the dog could get enou gh heat in the doghouse.
dark gray :: dark grey will make the dog house warm inside but it wont get to hot for the dog. in the jar the air tempature insde t he jar with the dark grey lid stayed at 48. there for in the dog house it wont be to cold or to hot it will be warm
white ::  White could be a color for the doghouse. It wouldn't make the inside of the doghouse too hot because of how light the color is. Also, in the experiment, white had the lowest temperature out of all four c olors. 42(DEG) C, 43(DEG) C, 41(DEG) C, and 42(DEG) C. Where as the other colors, black, dark gray, and light gray, all had higher temperatures. The temperatures vary from the highest temperature which was 54(DEG) C, the color black. To the lowest te mperature, 41(DEG) C for the color white.
black :: the color black is going to make the doghouse more warm, because darker colors absorb more energy.
black :: The darker the color is the hotter the doghou se would be. The lighter the doghouse is the cooler the doghouse would be inside
white :: it will keep the temp. in the 40(DEG) area ( C(DEG)) and not burn up the dog inside the dog-house.
white ::  The color white might affect the doghouse bec ause the dog won't get too hot in the summer because the weather is warme r in the summer and white is the coolest color out of the four. White was only 42 degrees and black was 53 degrees.
light gray :: Choosing the light gray for the color of the doghouse would be a good color. It wouldn't be to hot or to cold for the dog. During the experiment the black lid produced a very hot temerature o f 53(DEG)C. The white lid created a temperature of 42(DEG)C. Choosing the light gray color would be a good medium.
white :: White might affect the inside of the dog hous e because, it went up only 20 degrees from the starting temperature. I th ink white is the best paint color to use because, it had the lowest tempe ratures and it doesnt absorb alot of energy.
white ::  white would make the dog house less hot. the data table shows that the white paint kept the jar cooler than the other paint in trial 1,2, and 3.
white :: becuse dog can ony see black and white so that will affect the dog house
white ::  The color white wouldn't absorb as much ener gy as the darker colors so the doghouse wouldn't become too warm. With a black lid, the jar was an average temperture was 53(DEG) C after 10 minu tes. With the White lid the temperature was an average of 42(DEG) C. Thi s shows that the lighter the color, the less heat you will have trampted inside the dog house. Something to warm would not be suitable for a dog, and therefore making white the right color.
light gray :: light gray how it might affect the doghouse i s that the lighting could be so powerful from the light that the color mi ght get really hot well the dog house might get really hot.
light gray :: I think Light gray will be the best for the d og because in the summer it will not too warm (hot) and winter not too co ld. Since the data prove that the darker the object the more it will abso rb the energy which gain or lose heat based the color. And since the aver age data of Light gray is about in the middle which was 45(DEG)C.
white :: A white color would keep it cooler because, a ccording to the data, white has the lowest average temperature of 42 degr ees celcius, while black has the highest average temperature of 53 degree s celcius.
light gray ::  Based on the data I think light grey would be the best color. I think that because it would make the doghouse warm fo r the winter but it wont be too hot in the summer.
light gray :: A light gray would make the dog house warm bu t not too cold like when it is raining you don't want to have a white dog house. The average for the black colored lid was 53(DEG)C which is too hot and the dark gray was 48(DEG)C which is still a little too hot and t he average for the light gray is 45(DEG)C and the white was 42(DEG)C so you could paint it white if you wanted it cooler but it really depends o n the dog so if you had a shaved or close to shaved dog you would maybe e ven want a dark gray dog house but if you had a dog with a lot of hair yo u would want a white dog house.
white :: The white color would absorb the least amount of heat in the doghouse, meaning it would be great for summer. But if yo u want the warmer house in the winter, the black doghouse should do the t rick.
black ::  Really black.
white ::  If you use white paint color to paint a dog h ouse, it would be the best choice to keep the dog cool during a hot day. In the experiment out of the 4 tested lid colors, white held out to be th e one with the lowest temperature.
white ::  This color might affect the doghouse because since white doesn't absorb any heat the dog house inside will be cool eno ugh for the dog to be in. Darker color absorbs more energy and since whit e is the lightest color of all the colors there will be no energy absorbe d.
white :: This will help the dog so it wont get hot in the summer.
dark gray :: The color might affect the dog house by giving the doghouse more heat in the inside, but also not giving to much heat inside the doghouse. Dark gray will attract at an average about 48(DEG) C of heat, the black color has to much heat about 53(DEG) C, and the color white has to little of heat at about 42(DEG) C. So therefore the dark gray would be best for the color of the doghouse.
black :: the more dark the dog house iis the hoter it will be in the dog house so if it was black it would be hot in it like in the experiment when the kid was black it was 53 dagrees c and when the l id was white it was 42 dagrees
white ::  The color of the doghouse should be white because that way in the summer it won't be to hot for the dog. As shown in the data white is the coolest. The average for a black lid is 53(DEG) C. The dark gray lid is 48(DEG) C the light gray lid is 45(DEG) C and the white lid is 42(DEG) C. Therefore the white is the coolest and it won't get that hot for the dog.
white :: With a white doghouse the dog will be cool when the weather is warm/ hot because the white paint will not absorb as much heat and in the winter it will not matter because there is not much heat to absorb anyway so it would not matter how dark the paint is.
black ::  The color black whould be the best color to paint the dog house because, you will have a higher temperature with a darker color it will have a warmer. There will be a higher chance for the doghouse to be at a higher temperature.
black ::  it will keep it hot because black absorbes the suns rays faster then a lighter coller
white ::  The air temperature will be lower on average, because in the experiment white kept the temperature inside the jar the l owest.
light gray ::  this color will affect the doghouse by heatin it, but not overheating the doghouse.
white :: white because white reflects sun and u want i t to be cold in a dog house for a dog
dark gray ::  Dark gray would be a good color because it wo uldn't be too cold nor to hot. in the experiment the dark gray jar was in the middle of tempertures not being the coldest like the white or the wa rmest like black but somewhat in the middle with an average temp of 48(DEG) c
white :: The dog house would stay cooler because white doesn't attract the that much heat.
white :: The color white had the lowist temp at the en d of the expairement so that means it will be cooler inside the dog house then it would be with other colors
dark gray :: It wold make it cooler in the sumer but warme r in the winter because the dark coler would atraket the heat.
white ::  White would be better for the doghouse becaus e it doesnt absorb that much energy like black and dark gray did. white o nly absorbed an average of 42(DEG) c, where black absorbed an average of 53(DEG) c.
dark gray :: Dark Gray would be the best color for the dog house as it isn't too warm nor too cold. Darker colors attract more heat than Light so Dark Gray wouldn't be too hot or cold. In an Air temperatur e expirement, four colors were measured; Black, Dark Gray, Light Gray, an d White. The Data measured Black as 53(DEG)C, Dark Gray as 48(DEG)C, Li ght Gray 45(DEG), and White 42(DEG)C. Dark Gray as you see isn't too wa rm, neither too cold, making it the best color for the doghouse.
white ::  Using white paint would make the doghouse col der than if they used black paint. As was shown by the table, the average temperature of the jar with a black lid was 53(DEG)C, while the average temperature of the jar with a white lid was 42(DEG)C. The jar with the black lid was 11(DEG)C warmer than the jar with the white lid. Thus, usi ng white paint would also make the doghouse colder than using black paint , and Brandi and Jerry should use white paint.
white :: white will make the dog house cooler because it reflects the most light
white ::  The black was 9(DEG) C warmer then the white colored paint. The black paint would make the doghouse to warm for the dog. The white paint would be better bacause it would keep the doghouse cooler in the summer.
white :: painting the dog house white will keep the inside cooler then the black paint job by 11(DEG)C. the average temperature for the black lid jar air was 53(DEG)C where as the average temperature for the white lid jar air was an average of 42(DEG)C.
white :: White you be the best color for Brandi and Je rry's dog house because acording to their experiment, white absorbs less energy than darker colors. Therefor Brandi and Jerry's dog would be able to stay cool in warm weather.
dark gray :: It won't be too hot or too cold in the dog ho use.
white ::  bright colers reflect the light so the dog wi ll not get so hot.
black ::  the color black would keep the the dog warm.
light gray :: the color wouyld affect the dog house in this way in the heat the dog would stay cool but its not so light that it wou ld be cold for him in the winter. so keeping it at a light darker color y ou ahve a mixeture of the 2.
light gray ::  A light gray paint on the doghouse might prov ide some heat in the winter, while not making it too hot in the summer. T hat is shown by the data, in the 20(DEG) C increase in temp. Dark g ray or black would overheat the doghouse during the summer, because of th e average increases of 24(DEG)C for dark gray and 29(DEG)C fo r black. A white paint would not provide much heat during the winter, sho wn by the meager 18(DEG)C increase. However, on the other hand this experiment is n't closley applicable. the doghouse would not likely be made of glass, a nd sealed off from outside air curculation. Also, the sun burns many diff erent gases, providing a fuller spectrum of light than the lamp, in addit ion to being brighter. The doghouse would also likely have a thicker roof , made of wood and shingles. - a note: You could have interchangable roofs on the do ghouse, one of each color, and circulate them during the year, with white in the summer and black in the winter, and the other two scattered betwe en.
white :: i think it would be white because then when i t is hot out side then it would wouldnt be as hot in the dog house then i t would be when the dog house is white.
light gray ::  it will affect the dog house by keeping it so me what cool in the summer because the light gray glass jar absorbed an a verage of 45(DEG)Celsius while the black glass jar absorbed an average 5 3(DEG)Celsius making an 8(DEG)Celsius difference between the two.
black ::  The color black will be more warmer inside than any other colors above thus, Brandi and Jerry should paint th dog ho use black. According to the results from the experiment, the color black had the highest average air temperature of 53. The darker the color the warmer the air temperature was in the glass jar because darker colors absorb more energy.
black :: The black paint might make the dog house abso rb more heat, making the dog house warmer. I think this is how the paint will affect the dog house becuase in the experement results, the black pa int retained the most heat in the glass jar.
white ::  because white dose not atract anything
white :: white would be better because during the summ er it would be cool with a white dog house and it would be hot and humid with a black dog house
dark gray :: it will warm the dog house but not get it to warm
light gray :: Light gray would be a little cool in tempatur e as the black or dark gray one would get to hot and the white one would get a little cold.
light gray ::  In all seasons the doghouse will stay at a comfortable temperature. In the warmer weather the color won't absorb as much heat keeping the doghouse cool. During the colder seasons, the dog will still have a warmer area, and with the dogs fur he would stay nice and warm.
white :: The white paint color would be cooler becaus e on a sunny hot day the dog might be really hot, so the dog would just g o in his dog house. The white paint doesnt attract as much sun heat. Ther efor the inside of the dog house would be allot cooler than being in the sun. The experiment tells it all, the white after only 10 minutes got up to 40(DEG)c as the other colors went up to 45, 48, and 53. The dog would much appreciate a cooler place to rest. Coming to a solution the white p aint would be the best to use for a dog house.
black :: White would keep the doghouse the coldest (ar ound 40). If the doghouse was white it would be in the low forties. If th e doghouse was light grey it would be in the mid forties. If the doghouse was dark grey it would be high forties. If the doghouse was black it wou ld be in the low fifties. White would reflect the light and not heat up t he doghouse as much as any other color.
white :: it does not atract as much lite as a darker c olor
black :: because black absorbs heat more then the othe r colors
white :: The color white absorbs less heat therefore w ill reduce the impact the sun has on the temperature inside the doghouse.
black :: The color black prevents more cold and absorb s more thermal energy, making it a warmer place for the dog.
light gray ::  Light gray might affect the inside of the dog house because dark colors attract the sun and you do not want the dog to be too hot. But then you dont want white so the dog is not too cold. So t he average temperature for light gray is a good temperature for an living environment.
light gray ::  Painting the doghouse light gray would keep t he doghouse cool in the summer but warmer in the winter. I know this beca use the data tells you that the lighter the color of the glass jar, the c ooler the inside of the jar is and the darker the lid is the higher the t emparature while be in the glass jar
white :: white becuase if you live in a hot place the dog house will be less hot because white reflect most of the light off of the dog house.
light gray :: This color will affect the doghouse for the b est. The darker color keeps in heat but sometimes heat isn't always good. I found a compromise that can keep heat in and has a somewhat high air t emperature but won't be to hot for the dog.
light gray :: i think light gray would work the best becaus e,if its hot outside the house will manage to stay cool inside,and in the winter it will manage to stay warm inside.
dark gray ::  if they painted the doghouse dark gray, then the doghouse would stay warm because in trials #1-3 the temperatures stay ed at 48(DEG)C.
white :: the black would affect the doghouse because t he sun is attracted to black. so if the sun is beating down on the doghou se to long it is possible that the dog could over heat of get very sick. something eles could happen to the dog that is sleeping in the doghouse.
