a bad one
a combination of congress, the senate, and the president.  the law is created in congress.  if it's approved, then it is sent to the senate for approval.  if the senate approve, then it is sent to the president's desk for his consideration.  if he approves, then he signs it.  if he denies it, then he uses the presidential veto, which sends the bill back to congress.  in order for it to pass and become law without the president's consent, then it has to pass in congress again by a certain margin (which i can't remember right now).
